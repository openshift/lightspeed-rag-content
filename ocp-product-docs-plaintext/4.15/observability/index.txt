"Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" Observability overview

Red Hat OpenShift Observability provides real-time visibility, monitoring, and analysis of various system metrics, logs, traces, and events to help users quickly diagnose and troubleshoot issues before they impact systems or applications. To help ensure the reliability, performance, and security of your applications and infrastructure, "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" offers the following Observability components:

Monitoring

Logging

Distributed tracing

Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry

Network Observability

Power monitoring


Red Hat OpenShift Observability connects open-source observability tools and technologies to create a unified Observability solution. The components of Red Hat OpenShift Observability work together to help you collect, store, deliver, analyze, and visualize data.
Monitoring
Monitor the in-cluster health and performance of your applications running on "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" with metrics and customized alerts for CPU and memory usage, network connectivity, and other resource usage. Monitoring stack components are deployed and managed by the Cluster Monitoring Operator.

Monitoring stack components are deployed by default in every "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation and are managed by the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO). These components include Prometheus, Alertmanager, Thanos Querier, and others. The CMO also deploys the Telemeter Client, which sends a subset of data from platform Prometheus instances to Red Hat to facilitate Remote Health Monitoring for clusters.

For more information, see Monitoring overview and About remote health monitoring.
Logging
Collect, visualize, forward, and store log data to troubleshoot issues, identify performance bottlenecks, and detect security threats. In logging 5.7 and later versions, users can configure the LokiStack deployment to produce customized alerts and recorded metrics.
