# Installing


Installing the distributed tracing platform (Tempo) requires the Tempo Operator and choosing which type of deployment is best for your use case:
* For microservices mode, deploy a TempoStack instance in a dedicated OpenShift project.
* For monolithic mode, deploy a TempoMonolithic instance in a dedicated OpenShift project.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Using object storage requires setting up a supported object store and creating a secret for the object store credentials before deploying a TempoStack or TempoMonolithic instance.
----

# Installing the Tempo Operator

You can install the Tempo Operator by using the web console or the command line.

## Installing the Tempo Operator by using the web console

You can install the Tempo Operator from the Administrator view of the web console.

* You are logged in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console as a cluster administrator with the cluster-admin role.
* For Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated, you must be logged in using an account with the dedicated-admin role.
* You have completed setting up the required object storage by a supported provider: Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation, MinIO, Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage. For more information, see "Object storage setup".

[WARNING]
----
Object storage is required and not included with the distributed tracing platform (Tempo). You must choose and set up object storage by a supported provider before installing the distributed tracing platform (Tempo).
----

1. Go to Operators -> OperatorHub and search for Tempo Operator.
2. Select the Tempo Operator that is provided by Red Hat.

[IMPORTANT]
----
The following selections are the default presets for this Operator:
* Update channel -> stable
* Installation mode -> All namespaces on the cluster
* Installed Namespace -> openshift-tempo-operator
* Update approval -> Automatic
----
3. Select the Enable Operator recommended cluster monitoring on this Namespace checkbox.
4. Select Install -> Install -> View Operator.

* In the Details tab of the page of the installed Operator, under ClusterServiceVersion details, verify that the installation Status is Succeeded.

## Installing the Tempo Operator by using the CLI

You can install the Tempo Operator from the command line.

* An active OpenShift CLI (`oc`) session by a cluster administrator with the cluster-admin role.

[TIP]
----
* Ensure that your OpenShift CLI (`oc`) version is up to date and matches your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version.
* Run oc login:

```terminal
$ oc login --username=<your_username>
```

----
* You have completed setting up the required object storage by a supported provider: Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation, MinIO, Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage. For more information, see "Object storage setup".

[WARNING]
----
Object storage is required and not included with the distributed tracing platform (Tempo). You must choose and set up object storage by a supported provider before installing the distributed tracing platform (Tempo).

metadata:
  labels:
    kubernetes.io/metadata.name: openshift-tempo-operator
    openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"

$ oc get csv -n openshift-tempo-operator
```


# Installing a TempoStack instance

You can install a TempoStack instance by using the web console or the command line.

## Installing a TempoStack instance by using the web console

You can install a TempoStack instance from the Administrator view of the web console.

* You are logged in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console as a cluster administrator with the cluster-admin role.

* You have completed setting up the required object storage by a supported provider: Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation, MinIO, Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage. For more information, see "Object storage setup".

[WARNING]
----
Object storage is required and not included with the distributed tracing platform (Tempo). You must choose and set up object storage by a supported provider before installing the distributed tracing platform (Tempo).
----

1. Go to Home -> Projects -> Create Project to create a project of your choice for the TempoStack instance that you will create in a subsequent step.
2. Go to Workloads -> Secrets -> Create -> From YAML to create a secret for your object storage bucket in the project that you created for the TempoStack instance. For more information, see "Object storage setup".

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: minio-test
stringData:
  endpoint: http://minio.minio.svc:9000
  bucket: tempo
  access_key_id: tempo
  access_key_secret: <secret>
type: Opaque
```
3. Create a TempoStack instance.

[NOTE]
----
You can create multiple TempoStack instances in separate projects on the same cluster.
----
1. Go to Operators -> Installed Operators.
2. Select TempoStack -> Create TempoStack -> YAML view.
3. In the YAML view, customize the TempoStack custom resource (CR):

```yaml
apiVersion: tempo.grafana.com/v1alpha1
kind: TempoStack
metadata:
  name: sample
  namespace: <project_of_tempostack_instance>
spec:
  storageSize: <value>Gi 1

          type: route
  resources: 7
    total:
      limits:
        memory: <value>Gi
        cpu: <value>m
```

Size of the persistent volume claim for the Tempo WAL. The default is 10Gi.
Secret you created in step 2 for the object storage that had been set up as one of the prerequisites.
Value of the name in the metadata of the secret.
Accepted values are azure for Azure Blob Storage; gcs for Google Cloud Storage; and s3 for Amazon S3, MinIO, or Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation.
Optional.
Optional: Name of a ConfigMap object that contains a CA certificate.
Optional.

```

In this example, the object storage was set up as one of the prerequisites, and the object storage secret was created in step 2.
The stack deployed in this example is configured to receive Jaeger Thrift over HTTP and OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP), which permits visualizing the data with the Jaeger UI.

# Installing a TempoMonolithic instance


[IMPORTANT]
----
{FeatureName} is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
----

You can install a TempoMonolithic instance by using the web console or the command line.

The TempoMonolithic custom resource (CR) creates a Tempo deployment in monolithic mode.
All components of the Tempo deployment, such as the compactor, distributor, ingester, querier, and query frontend, are contained in a single container.

A TempoMonolithic instance supports storing traces in in-memory storage, a persistent volume, or object storage.

Tempo deployment in monolithic mode is preferred for a small deployment, demonstration, testing, and as a migration path of the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) all-in-one deployment.


[NOTE]
----
The monolithic deployment of Tempo does not scale horizontally.
If you require horizontal scaling, use the TempoStack CR for a Tempo deployment in microservices mode.

3. In the YAML view, customize the TempoMonolithic custom resource (CR).

The following TempoMonolithic CR creates a TempoMonolithic deployment with trace ingestion over OTLP/gRPC and OTLP/HTTP, storing traces in a supported type of storage and exposing Jaeger UI via a route:

        cpu: <value>m
```

Type of storage for storing traces: in-memory storage, a persistent volume, or object storage. The value for a persistent volume is pv. The accepted values for object storage are s3, gcs, or azure, depending on the used object store type. The default value is memory for the tmpfs in-memory storage, which is only appropriate for development, testing, demonstrations, and proof-of-concept environments because the data does not persist when the pod is shut down.
Memory size: For in-memory storage, this means the size of the tmpfs volume, where the default is 2Gi. For a persistent volume, this means the size of the persistent volume claim, where the default is 10Gi. For object storage, this means the size of the persistent volume claim for the Tempo WAL, where the default is 10Gi.
Optional: For object storage, the type of object storage. The accepted values are s3, gcs, and azure, depending on the used object store type.
Optional: For object storage, the value of the name in the metadata of the storage secret. The storage secret must be in the same namespace as the TempoMonolithic instance and contain the fields specified in "Table 1. Required secret parameters" in the section "Object storage setup".
