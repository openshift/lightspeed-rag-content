# Configuring the distributed tracing platform



[TIP]
----
For information about configuring the deprecated distributed tracing platform (Jaeger), see Configuring in the distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) documentation.
----
The Tempo Operator uses a custom resource definition (CRD) file that defines the architecture and configuration settings for creating and deploying the distributed tracing platform (Tempo) resources. You can install the default configuration or modify the file.

# Introduction to TempoStack configuration parameters

The TempoStack custom resource (CR) defines the architecture and settings for creating the distributed tracing platform (Tempo) resources. You can modify these parameters to customize your implementation to your business needs.

# Query configuration options

Two components of the distributed tracing platform (Tempo), the querier and query frontend, manage queries. You can configure both of these components.

The querier component finds the requested trace ID in the ingesters or back-end storage. Depending on the set parameters, the querier component can query both the ingesters and pull bloom or indexes from the back end to search blocks in object storage. The querier component exposes an HTTP endpoint at GET /querier/api/traces/<trace_id>, but it is not expected to be used directly. Queries must be sent to the query frontend.



The query frontend component is responsible for sharding the search space for an incoming query. The query frontend exposes traces via a simple HTTP endpoint: GET /api/traces/<trace_id>. Internally, the query frontend component splits the blockID space into a configurable number of shards and then queues these requests. The querier component connects to the query frontend component via a streaming gRPC connection to process these sharded queries.

# Configuring the Monitor tab in Jaeger UI

You can have the request rate, error, and duration (RED) metrics extracted from traces and visualized through the Jaeger Console in the Monitor tab of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console. The metrics are derived from spans in the OpenTelemetry Collector that are scraped from the Collector by Prometheus, which you can deploy in your user-workload monitoring stack. The Jaeger UI queries these metrics from the Prometheus endpoint and visualizes them.

* You have configured the permissions and tenants for the distributed tracing platform (Tempo). For more information, see "Configuring the permissions and tenants".

1. In the OpenTelemetryCollector custom resource of the OpenTelemetry Collector, enable the Spanmetrics Connector (spanmetrics), which derives metrics from traces and exports the metrics in the Prometheus format.
Example OpenTelemetryCollector custom resource for span RED

```yaml
apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1beta1
kind: OpenTelemetryCollector
metadata:
  name: otel
spec:
  mode: deployment
  observability:
    metrics:
      enableMetrics: true 1
  config: |
    connectors:
      spanmetrics: 2
        metrics_flush_interval: 15s

    receivers:
      otlp: 3
        protocols:
          grpc:
          http:

    exporters:
      prometheus: 4
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:8889
        add_metric_suffixes: false
        resource_to_telemetry_conversion:
          enabled: true 5

      otlp:
        auth:
          authenticator: bearertokenauth
        endpoint: tempo-redmetrics-gateway.mynamespace.svc.cluster.local:8090
        headers:
          X-Scope-OrgID: dev
        tls:
          ca_file: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/service-ca.crt
          insecure: false

    extensions:
      bearertokenauth:
        filename: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token

    service:
      extensions:
      - bearertokenauth
      pipelines:
        traces:
          receivers: [otlp]
          exporters: [otlp, spanmetrics] 6
        metrics:
          receivers: [spanmetrics] 7
          exporters: [prometheus]

# ...
```

Creates the ServiceMonitor custom resource to enable scraping of the Prometheus exporter.
The Spanmetrics connector receives traces and exports metrics.
The OTLP receiver to receive spans in the OpenTelemetry protocol.
The Prometheus exporter is used to export metrics in the Prometheus format.
The resource attributes are dropped by default.
The Spanmetrics connector is configured as exporter in traces pipeline.
The Spanmetrics connector is configured as receiver in metrics pipeline.
2. In the TempoStack custom resource, enable the Monitor tab and set the Prometheus endpoint to the Thanos querier service to query the data from your user-defined monitoring stack.
Example TempoStack custom resource with the enabled Monitor tab

```yaml
apiVersion: tempo.grafana.com/v1alpha1
kind: TempoStack
metadata:
  name: redmetrics
spec:
  storage:
    secret:
      name: minio-test
      type: s3
  storageSize: 1Gi
  tenants:
    mode: openshift
    authentication:
      - tenantName: dev
        tenantId: "1610b0c3-c509-4592-a256-a1871353dbfa"
  template:
    gateway:
      enabled: true
    queryFrontend:
      jaegerQuery:
        monitorTab:
          enabled: true 1
          prometheusEndpoint: https://thanos-querier.openshift-monitoring.svc.cluster.local:9092 2
          redMetricsNamespace: "" 3

# ...
```

Enables the monitoring tab in the Jaeger console.
The service name for Thanos Querier from user-workload monitoring.
Optional: The metrics namespace on which the Jaeger query retrieves the Prometheus metrics. Include this line only if you are using an OpenTelemetry Collector version earlier than 0.109.0. If you are using an OpenTelemetry Collector version 0.109.0 or later, omit this line.
3. Optional: Use the span RED metrics generated by the spanmetrics connector with alerting rules. For example, for alerts about a slow service or to define service level objectives (SLOs), the connector creates a duration_bucket histogram and the calls counter metric. These metrics have labels that identify the service, API name, operation type, and other attributes.
Labels of the metrics created in the spanmetrics connector

Example PrometheusRule custom resource that defines an alerting rule for SLO when not serving 95% of requests within 2000ms on the front-end service

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  name: span-red
spec:
  groups:
  - name: server-side-latency
    rules:
    - alert: SpanREDFrontendAPIRequestLatency
      expr: histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(duration_bucket{service_name="frontend", span_kind="SPAN_KIND_SERVER"}[5m])) by (le, service_name, span_name)) > 2000 1
      labels:
        severity: Warning
      annotations:
        summary: "High request latency on {{$labels.service_name}} and {{$labels.span_name}}"
        description: "{{$labels.instance}} has 95th request latency above 2s (current value: {{$value}}s)"
```

The expression for checking if 95% of the front-end server response time values are below 2000 ms. The time range ([5m]) must be at least four times the scrape interval and long enough to accommodate a change in the metric.

# Configuring the receiver TLS

The custom resource of your TempoStack or TempoMonolithic instance supports configuring the TLS for receivers by using user-provided certificates or OpenShift&#8217;s service serving certificates.

## Receiver TLS configuration for a TempoStack instance

You can provide a TLS certificate in a secret or use the service serving certificates that are generated by Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

* To provide a TLS certificate in a secret, configure it in the TempoStack custom resource.

[NOTE]
----
This feature is not supported with the enabled Tempo Gateway.
----
TLS for receivers and using a user-provided certificate in a secret

```yaml
apiVersion: tempo.grafana.com/v1alpha1
kind:  TempoStack
# ...
spec:
# ...
  template:
    distributor:
      tls:
        enabled: true 1
        certName: <tls_secret> 2
        caName: <ca_name> 3
# ...
```

TLS enabled at the Tempo Distributor.
Secret containing a tls.key key and tls.crt certificate that you apply in advance.
Optional: CA in a config map to enable mutual TLS authentication (mTLS).
* Alternatively, you can use the service serving certificates that are generated by Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

[NOTE]
----
Mutual TLS authentication (mTLS) is not supported with this feature.
----
TLS for receivers and using the service serving certificates that are generated by Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

# Configuring the query RBAC

As an administrator, you can set up the query role-based access control (RBAC) to filter the span attributes for your users by the namespaces for which you granted them permissions.


[NOTE]
----
When you enable the query RBAC, users can still access traces from all namespaces, and the service.name and k8s.namespace.name attributes are also visible to all users.
----

* An active OpenShift CLI (`oc`) session by a cluster administrator with the cluster-admin role.

[TIP]
----
* Ensure that your OpenShift CLI (`oc`) version is up to date and matches your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version.
* Run oc login:

```terminal
$ oc login --username=<your_username>
```

----

1. Enable multitenancy and query RBAC in the TempoStack custom resource (CR), for example:

```yaml
apiVersion: tempo.grafana.com/v1alpha1
kind: TempoStack
metadata:
  name: simplest
  namespace: chainsaw-multitenancy
spec:
  storage:
    secret:
      name: minio
      type: s3
  storageSize: 1Gi
  resources:
    total:
      limits:
        memory: 2Gi
        cpu: 2000m
  tenants:
    mode: openshift
    authentication:
      - tenantName: dev
        tenantId: "1610b0c3-c509-4592-a256-a1871353dbfb"
  template:
    gateway:
      enabled: true 1
      rbac:
        enabled: true 2
    queryFrontend:
      jaegerQuery:
        enabled: false 3
```

Always set to true.
Always set to true.
Always set to false.
2. Create a cluster role and cluster role binding to grant the target users the permissions to access the tenant that you specified in the TempoStack CR, for example:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: tempo-dev-read
rules:
- apiGroups: [tempo.grafana.com]
  resources: [dev] 1
  resourceNames: [traces]
  verbs: [get]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: tempo-dev-read
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: tempo-dev-read
subjects:
  - kind: Group
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    name: system:authenticated 2
```

Tenant name in the TempoStack CR.
Means all authenticated OpenShift users.
3. Grant the target users the permissions to read attributes for the project. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user view <username> -n <project>
```


# Using taints and tolerations

To schedule the TempoStack pods on dedicated nodes, see How to deploy the different TempoStack components on infra nodes using nodeSelector and tolerations in OpenShift 4.

# Configuring monitoring and alerts

The Tempo Operator supports monitoring and alerts about each TempoStack component such as distributor, ingester, and so on, and exposes upgrade and operational metrics about the Operator itself.

## Configuring the TempoStack metrics and alerts

You can enable metrics and alerts of TempoStack instances.

* Monitoring for user-defined projects is enabled in the cluster.

1. To enable metrics of a TempoStack instance, set the spec.observability.metrics.createServiceMonitors field to true:

```yaml
apiVersion: tempo.grafana.com/v1alpha1
kind: TempoStack
metadata:
  name: <name>
spec:
  observability:
    metrics:
      createServiceMonitors: true
```

2. To enable alerts for a TempoStack instance, set the spec.observability.metrics.createPrometheusRules field to true:

```yaml
apiVersion: tempo.grafana.com/v1alpha1
kind: TempoStack
metadata:
  name: <name>
spec:
  observability:
    metrics:
      createPrometheusRules: true
```


You can use the Administrator view of the web console to verify successful configuration:

1. Go to Observe -> Targets, filter for Source: User, and check that ServiceMonitors in the format tempo-<instance_name>-<component> have the Up status.
2. To verify that alerts are set up correctly, go to Observe -> Alerting -> Alerting rules, filter for Source: User, and check that the Alert rules for the TempoStack instance components are available.

* Enabling monitoring for user-defined projects

## Configuring the Tempo Operator metrics and alerts

When installing the Tempo Operator from the web console, you can select the Enable Operator recommended cluster monitoring on this Namespace checkbox, which enables creating metrics and alerts of the Tempo Operator.

If the checkbox was not selected during installation, you can manually enable metrics and alerts even after installing the Tempo Operator.

* Add the openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true" label in the project where the Tempo Operator is installed, which is openshift-tempo-operator by default.

You can use the Administrator view of the web console to verify successful configuration:

1. Go to Observe -> Targets, filter for Source: Platform, and search for tempo-operator, which must have the Up status.
2. To verify that alerts are set up correctly, go to Observe -> Alerting -> Alerting rules, filter for Source: Platform, and locate the Alert rules for the Tempo Operator.
