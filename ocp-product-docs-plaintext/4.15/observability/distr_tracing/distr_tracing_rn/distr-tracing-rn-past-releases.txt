Release notes for Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform 3.1
This release of the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform includes the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Tempo) and the deprecated Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger).

Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Tempo)
The Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Tempo) is provided through the Tempo Operator.

New features and enhancements
This update introduces the following enhancements for the distributed tracing platform (Tempo):

Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Tempo) 3.1 is based on the open source Grafana Tempo 2.3.1.

Support for cluster-wide proxy environments.

Support for TraceQL to Gateway component.
Bug fixes
This update introduces the following bug fixes for the distributed tracing platform (Tempo):

Before this update, when a TempoStack instance was created with the monitorTab enabled in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15, the required tempo-redmetrics-cluster-monitoring-view ClusterRoleBinding was not created. This update resolves the issue by fixing the Operator RBAC for the monitor tab when the Operator is deployed in an arbitrary namespace. (TRACING-3786)

Before this update, when a TempoStack instance was created on an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster with only an IPv6 networking stack, the compactor and ingestor pods ran in the CrashLoopBackOff state, resulting in multiple errors. This update provides support for IPv6 clusters.(TRACING-3226)
Known issues
There are currently known issues:

Currently, when used with the Tempo Operator, the Jaeger UI only displays services that have sent traces in the last 15 minutes. For services that did not send traces in the last 15 minutes, traces are still stored but not displayed in the Jaeger UI. (TRACING-3139)

Currently, the distributed tracing platform (Tempo) fails on the IBM Z (s390x) architecture. (TRACING-3545)
Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger)
The Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) is provided through the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform Operator.

Jaeger does not use FIPS validated cryptographic modules.
Support for Elasticsearch Operator
Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) 3.1 is supported for use with the Elasticsearch Operator 5.6, 5.7, and 5.8.
Deprecated functionality
In the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform 3.1, Jaeger and support for Elasticsearch remain deprecated, and both are planned to be removed in a future release. Red Hat will provide critical and above CVE bug fixes and support for these components during the current release lifecycle, but these components will no longer receive feature enhancements.

In the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform 3.1, Tempo provided by the Tempo Operator and the OpenTelemetry Collector provided by the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing data collection are the preferred Operators for distributed tracing collection and storage. The OpenTelemetry and Tempo distributed tracing stack is to be adopted by all users because this will be the stack that will be enhanced going forward.
New features and enhancements
This update introduces the following enhancements for the distributed tracing platform (Jaeger):

Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) 3.1 is based on the open source Jaeger release 1.53.0.
Bug fixes
This update introduces the following bug fix for the distributed tracing platform (Jaeger):

Before this update, the connection target URL for the jaeger-agent container in the jager-query pod was overwritten with another namespace URL in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.13. This was caused by a bug in the sidecar injection code in the jaeger-operator, causing nondeterministic jaeger-agent injection. With this update, the Operator prioritizes the Jaeger instance from the same namespace as the target deployment. (TRACING-3722)
Known issues
There are currently known issues:

Currently, Apache Spark is not supported.

Currently, the streaming deployment via AMQ/Kafka is not supported on the IBM Z and IBM Power architectures.

New features and enhancements
This update introduces the following enhancements for the distributed tracing platform (Jaeger):

Support for the ARM architecture.

Support for cluster-wide proxy environments.
Bug fixes
This update introduces the following bug fix for the distributed tracing platform (Jaeger):

Before this update, the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator used other images than relatedImages. This caused the ImagePullBackOff error in disconnected network environments when launching the jaeger pod because the oc adm catalog mirror command mirrors images specified in relatedImages. This update provides support for disconnected environments when using the oc adm catalog mirror CLI command. (TRACING-3546)
Known issues
There is currently a known issue:

Currently, Apache Spark is not supported.

Bug fixes
This update introduces the following bug fixes for the distributed tracing platform (Tempo):

Before this update, the TempoStack CRD was not accepting custom CA certificate despite the option to choose CA certificates. This update fixes support for the custom TLS CA option for connecting to object storage. (TRACING-3462)

Before this update, when mirroring the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform Operator images to a mirror registry for use in a disconnected cluster, the related Operator images for tempo, tempo-gateway, opa-openshift, and tempo-query were not mirrored. This update fixes support for disconnected environments when using the oc adm catalog mirror CLI command. (TRACING-3523)

Before this update, the query frontend service of the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform was using internal mTLS when gateway was not deployed. This caused endpoint failure errors. This update fixes mTLS when Gateway is not deployed. (TRACING-3510)
Known issues
There are currently known issues:

Currently, when used with the Tempo Operator, the Jaeger UI only displays services that have sent traces in the last 15 minutes. For services that did not send traces in the last 15 minutes, traces are still stored but not displayed in the Jaeger UI. (TRACING-3139)

Technology Preview features
This release introduces support for the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Tempo) as a Technology Preview feature for Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform.

The Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Tempo) is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
The feature uses version 0.1.0 of the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Tempo) and version 2.0.1 of the upstream distributed tracing platform (Tempo) components.

You can use the distributed tracing platform (Tempo) to replace Jaeger so that you can use S3-compatible storage instead of ElasticSearch. Most users who use the distributed tracing platform (Tempo) instead of Jaeger will not notice any difference in functionality because the distributed tracing platform (Tempo) supports the same ingestion and query protocols as Jaeger and uses the same user interface.

If you enable this Technology Preview feature, note the following limitations of the current implementation:

The distributed tracing platform (Tempo) currently does not support disconnected installations. (TRACING-3145)

When you use the Jaeger user interface (UI) with the distributed tracing platform (Tempo), the Jaeger UI lists only services that have sent traces within the last 15 minutes. For services that have not sent traces within the last 15 minutes, those traces are still stored even though they are not visible in the Jaeger UI. (TRACING-3139)


Expanded support for the Tempo Operator is planned for future releases of the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform. Possible additional features might include support for TLS authentication, multitenancy, and multiple clusters. For more information about the Tempo Operator, see the Tempo community documentation.
