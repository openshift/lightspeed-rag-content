# Scheduling resources

Taints and tolerations allow the node to control which pods should (or should not) be scheduled on them.
A node selector specifies a map of key/value pairs that are defined using custom labels on nodes and selectors specified in pods.
For the pod to be eligible to run on a node, the pod must have the same key/value node selector as the label on the node.

# Network Observability deployment in specific nodes

You can configure the FlowCollector to control the deployment of Network Observability components in specific nodes. The spec.agent.ebpf.advanced.scheduling, spec.processor.advanced.scheduling, and spec.consolePlugin.advanced.scheduling specifications have the following configurable settings:

* NodeSelector
* Tolerations
* Affinity
* PriorityClassName


```yaml
apiVersion: flows.netobserv.io/v1beta2
kind: FlowCollector
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
# ...
advanced:
  scheduling:
    tolerations:
    - key: "<taint key>"
      operator: "Equal"
      value: "<taint value>"
      effect: "<taint effect>"
      nodeSelector:
        <key>: <value>
      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
