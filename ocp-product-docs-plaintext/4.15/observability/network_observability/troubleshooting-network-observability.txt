Troubleshooting Network Observability

To assist in troubleshooting Network Observability issues, you can perform some troubleshooting actions.
Using the must-gather tool
You can use the must-gather tool to collect information about the Network Observability Operator resources and cluster-wide resources, such as pod logs, FlowCollector, and webhook configurations.

Navigate to the directory where you want to store the must-gather data.

Run the following command to collect cluster-wide must-gather resources:
Configuring network traffic menu entry in the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" console
Manually configure the network traffic menu entry in the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" console when the network traffic menu entry is not listed in Observe menu in the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" console.

You have installed "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" version 4.10 or newer.


Check if the spec.consolePlugin.register field is set to true by running the following command:

Optional: Add the netobserv-plugin plugin by manually editing the Console Operator config:

Optional: Set the spec.consolePlugin.register field to true by running the following command:

Ensure the status of console pods is running by running the following command:

Restart the console pods by running the following command:

Clear your browser cache and history.

Check the status of Network Observability plugin pods by running the following command:

Check the logs of the Network Observability plugin pods by running the following command:
Flowlogs-Pipeline does not consume network flows after installing Kafka
If you deployed the flow collector first with deploymentModel: KAFKA and then deployed Kafka, the flow collector might not connect correctly to Kafka. Manually restart the flow-pipeline pods where Flowlogs-pipeline does not consume network flows from Kafka.

Delete the flow-pipeline pods to restart them by running the following command:
Failing to see network flows from both br-int and br-ex interfaces
br-ex` and br-int are virtual bridge devices operated at OSI layer 2. The eBPF agent works at the IP and TCP levels, layers 3 and 4 respectively. You can expect that the eBPF agent captures the network traffic passing through br-ex and br-int, when the network traffic is processed by other interfaces such as physical host or virtual pod interfaces. If you restrict the eBPF agent network interfaces to attach only to br-ex and br-int, you do not see any network flow.

Manually remove the part in the interfaces or excludeInterfaces that restricts the network interfaces to br-int and br-ex.

Remove the interfaces: [ 'br-int', 'br-ex' ] field. This allows the agent to fetch information from all the interfaces. Alternatively, you can specify the Layer-3 interface for example, eth0. Run the following command:
Network Observability controller manager pod runs out of memory
You can increase memory limits for the Network Observability operator by editing the spec.config.resources.limits.memory specification in the Subscription object.

In the web console, navigate to Operators -> Installed Operators

Click Network Observability and then select Subscription.

From the Actions menu, click Edit Subscription.

Edit the Subscription object to add the config.resources.limits.memory specification and set the value to account for your memory requirements. See the Additional resources for more information about resource considerations:
Running custom queries to Loki
For troubleshooting, can run custom queries to Loki. There are two examples of ways to do this, which you can adapt according to your needs by replacing the <api_token> with your own.

These examples use the netobserv namespace for the Network Observability Operator and Loki deployments. Additionally, the examples assume that the LokiStack is named loki. You can optionally use a different namespace and naming by adapting the examples, specifically the -n netobserv or the loki-gateway URL.
Installed Loki Operator for use with Network Observability Operator


To get all available labels, run the following:

To get all flows from the source namespace, my-namespace, run the following:


Resource considerations
Troubleshooting Loki ResourceExhausted error
Loki may return a ResourceExhausted error when network flow data sent by Network Observability exceeds the configured maximum message size. If you are using the Red Hat Loki Operator, this maximum message size is configured to 100 MiB.

Navigate to Operators -> Installed Operators, viewing All projects from the Project drop-down menu.

In the Provided APIs list, select the Network Observability Operator.

Click the Flow Collector then the YAML view tab.

Click Save if you edited the FlowCollector.
Loki empty ring error
The Loki "empty ring" error results in flows not being stored in Loki and not showing up in the web console. This error might happen in various situations. A single workaround to address them all does not exist. There are some actions you can take to investigate the logs in your Loki pods, and verify that the LokiStack is healthy and ready.

Some of the situations where this error is observed are as follows:

After a LokiStack is uninstalled and reinstalled in the same namespace, old PVCs are not removed, which can cause this error.

After a certificate rotation, this error can prevent communication with the flowlogs-pipeline and console-plugin pods.
Resource troubleshooting

LokiStack rate limit errors
A rate-limit placed on the Loki tenant can result in potential temporary loss of data and a 429 error: Per stream rate limit exceeded (limit:xMB/sec) while attempting to ingest for stream. You might consider having an alert set to notify you of this error. For more information, see "Creating Loki rate limit alerts for the NetObserv dashboard" in the Additional resources of this section.

You can update the LokiStack CRD with the perStreamRateLimit and perStreamRateLimitBurst specifications, as shown in the following procedure.

Navigate to Operators -> Installed Operators, viewing All projects from the Project dropdown.

Look for Loki Operator, and select the LokiStack tab.

Create or edit an existing LokiStack instance using the YAML view to add the perStreamRateLimit and perStreamRateLimitBurst specifications:

Click Save.


Once you update the perStreamRateLimit and perStreamRateLimitBurst specifications, the pods in your cluster restart and the 429 rate-limit error no longer occurs.
