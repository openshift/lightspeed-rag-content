Observing the network traffic

As an administrator, you can observe the network traffic in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform console for detailed troubleshooting and analysis. This feature helps you get insights from different graphical representations of traffic flow. There are several available views to observe the network traffic.
Observing the network traffic from the Overview view
The Overview view displays the overall aggregated metrics of the network traffic flow on the cluster. As an administrator, you can monitor the statistics with the available display options.

Working with the Overview view
As an administrator, you can navigate to the Overview view to see the graphical representation of the flow rate statistics.

Navigate to Observe → Network Traffic.

In the Network Traffic page, click the Overview tab.


You can configure the scope of each flow rate data by clicking the menu icon.
Configuring advanced options for the Overview view
You can customize the graphical view by using advanced options. To access the advanced options, click Show advanced options. You can configure the details in the graph by using the Display options drop-down menu. The options available are as follows:

Scope: Select to view the components that network traffic flows between. You can set the scope to Node, Namespace, Owner, Zones, Cluster or Resource. Owner is an aggregation of resources. Resource can be a pod, service, node, in case of host-network traffic, or an unknown IP address. The default value is Namespace.

Truncate labels: Select the required width of the label from the drop-down list. The default value is M.


Managing panels and display
You can select the required panels to be displayed, reorder them, and focus on a specific panel. To add or remove panels, click Manage panels.

The following panels are shown by default:

Top X average bytes rates

Top X bytes rates stacked with total


Other panels can be added in Manage panels:

Top X average packets rates

Top X packets rates stacked with total


Query options allows you to choose whether to show the Top 5, Top 10, or Top 15 rates.
Packet drop tracking
You can configure graphical representation of network flow records with packet loss in the Overview view. By employing eBPF tracepoint hooks, you can gain valuable insights into packet drops for TCP, UDP, SCTP, ICMPv4, and ICMPv6 protocols, which can result in the following actions:

Identification: Pinpoint the exact locations and network paths where packet drops are occurring. Determine whether specific devices, interfaces, or routes are more prone to drops.

Root cause analysis: Examine the data collected by the eBPF program to understand the causes of packet drops. For example, are they a result of congestion, buffer issues, or specific network events?

Performance optimization: With a clearer picture of packet drops, you can take steps to optimize network performance, such as adjust buffer sizes, reconfigure routing paths, or implement Quality of Service (QoS) measures.


When packet drop tracking is enabled, you can see the following panels in the Overview by default:

Top X packet dropped state stacked with total

Top X packet dropped cause stacked with total

Top X average dropped packets rates

Top X dropped packets rates stacked with total


Other packet drop panels are available to add in Manage panels:

Top X average dropped bytes rates

Top X dropped bytes rates stacked with total


Types of packet drops
Two kinds of packet drops are detected by Network Observability: host drops and OVS drops. Host drops are prefixed with SKB_DROP and OVS drops are prefixed with OVS_DROP. Dropped flows are shown in the side panel of the Traffic flows table along with a link to a description of each drop type. Examples of host drop reasons are as follows:

SKB_DROP_REASON_NO_SOCKET: the packet dropped due to a missing socket.

SKB_DROP_REASON_TCP_CSUM: the packet dropped due to a TCP checksum error.


Examples of OVS drops reasons are as follows:

OVS_DROP_LAST_ACTION: OVS packets dropped due to an implicit drop action, for example due to a configured network policy.

OVS_DROP_IP_TTL: OVS packets dropped due to an expired IP TTL.


See the Additional Resources of this section for more information about enabling and working with packet drop tracking.

Network Observability metrics
DNS tracking
You can configure graphical representation of Domain Name System (DNS) tracking of network flows in the Overview view. Using DNS tracking with extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) tracepoint hooks can serve various purposes:

Network Monitoring: Gain insights into DNS queries and responses, helping network administrators identify unusual patterns, potential bottlenecks, or performance issues.

Security Analysis: Detect suspicious DNS activities, such as domain name generation algorithms (DGA) used by malware, or identify unauthorized DNS resolutions that might indicate a security breach.

Troubleshooting: Debug DNS-related issues by tracing DNS resolution steps, tracking latency, and identifying misconfigurations.


By default, when DNS tracking is enabled, you can see the following non-empty metrics represented in a donut or line chart in the Overview:

Top X DNS Response Code

Top X average DNS latencies with overall

Top X 90th percentile DNS latencies


Other DNS tracking panels can be added in Manage panels:

Bottom X minimum DNS latencies

Top X maximum DNS latencies

Top X 99th percentile DNS latencies


This feature is supported for IPv4 and IPv6 UDP and TCP protocols.

See the Additional Resources in this section for more information about enabling and working with this view.

Network Observability metrics
Round-Trip Time
You can use TCP handshake Round-Trip Time (RTT) to analyze network flows. You can use RTT captured from the fentry/tcp_rcv_established eBPF hookpoint to read SRTT from the TCP socket to help with the following:

Network Monitoring: Gain insights into TCP handshakes, helping
network administrators identify unusual patterns, potential bottlenecks, or
performance issues.

Troubleshooting: Debug TCP-related issues by tracking latency and identifying
misconfigurations.


By default, when RTT is enabled, you can see the following TCP handshake RTT metrics represented in the Overview:

Top X 90th percentile TCP handshake Round Trip Time with overall

Top X average TCP handshake Round Trip Time with overall

Bottom X minimum TCP handshake Round Trip Time with overall


Other RTT panels can be added in Manage panels:

Top X maximum TCP handshake Round Trip Time with overall

Top X 99th percentile TCP handshake Round Trip Time with overall


See the Additional Resources in this section for more information about enabling and working with this view.

Working with conversation tracking
As an administrator, you can group network flows that are part of the same conversation. A conversation is defined as a grouping of peers that are identified by their IP addresses, ports, and protocols, resulting in an unique Conversation Id. You can query conversation events in the web console. These events are represented in the web console as follows:

Conversation start: This event happens when a connection is starting or TCP flag intercepted

Conversation tick: This event happens at each specified interval defined in the FlowCollector spec.processor.conversationHeartbeatInterval parameter while the connection is active.

Conversation end: This event happens when the FlowCollector spec.processor.conversationEndTimeout parameter is reached or  the TCP flag is intercepted.

Flow: This is the network traffic flow that occurs within the specified interval.


In the web console, navigate to Operators -> Installed Operators.

Under the Provided APIs heading for the NetObserv Operator, select Flow Collector.

Select cluster then select the YAML tab.

Configure the FlowCollector custom resource so that spec.processor.logTypes, conversationEndTimeout, and conversationHeartbeatInterval parameters are set according to your observation needs. A sample configuration is as follows:

Refresh the Network Traffic page on the Traffic flows tab. Notice there are two new columns, Event/Type and Conversation Id. All the Event/Type fields are Flow when Flow is the selected query option.

Select Query Options and choose the Log Type, Conversation. Now the Event/Type shows all of the desired conversation events.

Next you can filter on a specific conversation ID or switch between the Conversation and Flow log type options from the side panel.
Working with packet drops
Packet loss occurs when one or more packets of network flow data fail to reach their destination. You can track these drops by editing the FlowCollector to the specifications in the following YAML example.

Query Options
You can use Query Options to optimize the search results, as listed below:
Quick filters
The default values in Quick filters drop-down menu are defined in the FlowCollector configuration. You can modify the options from console.
Advanced filters
You can set the advanced filters, Common, Source, or Destination, by selecting the parameter to be filtered from the dropdown list. The flow data is filtered based on the selection. To enable or disable the applied filter, you can click on the applied filter listed below the filter options.


You can toggle between  One way and   Back and forth filtering. The  One way filter shows only Source and Destination traffic according to your filter selections. You can use Swap to change the directional view of the Source and Destination traffic. The   Back and forth filter includes return traffic with the Source and Destination filters. The directional flow of network traffic is shown in the Direction column in the Traffic flows table as Ingress`or `Egress for inter-node traffic and `Inner`for traffic inside a single node.

You can click Reset defaults to remove the existing filters, and apply the filter defined in FlowCollector configuration.
