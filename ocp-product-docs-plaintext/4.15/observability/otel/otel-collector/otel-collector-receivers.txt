# Receivers


Receivers get data into the Collector. A receiver can be push or pull based. Generally, a receiver accepts data in a specified format, translates it into the internal format, and passes it to processors and exporters defined in the applicable pipelines. By default, no receivers are configured. One or more receivers must be configured. Receivers may support one or more data sources.

# OTLP Receiver

The OTLP Receiver ingests traces, metrics, and logs by using the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP).

# Kubernetes Objects Receiver

The Kubernetes Objects Receiver pulls or watches objects to be collected from the Kubernetes API server.
This receiver watches primarily Kubernetes events, but it can collect any type of Kubernetes objects.
This receiver gathers telemetry for the cluster as a whole, so only one instance of this receiver suffices for collecting all the data.

The time interval to wait after the first failure before retrying. The default value is 1s. The units are ms, s, m, h.
The upper bound for the retry backoff interval. When this value is reached, the time interval between consecutive retry attempts remains constant at this value. The default value is 30s. The supported units are ms, s, m, h.
The maximum time interval, including retry attempts, for attempting to send a logs batch to a downstream consumer. When this value is reached, the data are discarded. If the set value is 0, retrying never stops. The default value is 5m. The supported units are ms, s, m, h.
