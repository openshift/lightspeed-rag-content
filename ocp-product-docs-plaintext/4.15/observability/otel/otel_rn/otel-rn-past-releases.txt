Release notes for past releases of Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry

Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry overview
Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry is based on the open source OpenTelemetry project, which aims to provide unified, standardized, and vendor-neutral telemetry data collection for cloud-native software. Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry product provides support for deploying and managing the OpenTelemetry Collector and simplifying the workload instrumentation.

The OpenTelemetry Collector can receive, process, and forward telemetry data in multiple formats, making it the ideal component for telemetry processing and interoperability between telemetry systems. The Collector provides a unified solution for collecting and processing metrics, traces, and logs.

The OpenTelemetry Collector has a number of features including the following:


Data Collection and Processing Hub
It acts as a central component that gathers telemetry data like metrics and traces from various sources. This data can be created from instrumented applications and infrastructure.
Customizable telemetry data pipeline
The OpenTelemetry Collector is designed to be customizable. It supports various processors, exporters, and receivers.
Auto-instrumentation features
Automatic instrumentation simplifies the process of adding observability to applications. Developers don't need to manually instrument their code for basic telemetry data.


Here are some of the use cases for the OpenTelemetry Collector:


Centralized data collection
In a microservices architecture, the Collector can be deployed to aggregate data from multiple services.
Data enrichment and processing
Before forwarding data to analysis tools, the Collector can enrich, filter, and process this data.
Multi-backend receiving and exporting
The Collector can receive and send data to multiple monitoring and analysis platforms simultaneously.
Release notes for Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry 3.1
The Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry is provided through the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator.

New features and enhancements
This update introduces the following enhancements:

Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry 3.1 is based on the open source OpenTelemetry release 0.93.0.

The target allocator is an optional component of the OpenTelemetry Operator that shards Prometheus receiver scrape targets across the deployed fleet of OpenTelemetry Collector instances. The target allocator provides integration with the Prometheus PodMonitor and ServiceMonitor custom resources.
Release notes for Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry 3.0
New features and enhancements
This update introduces the following enhancements:

Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry 3.0 is based on the open source OpenTelemetry release 0.89.0.

Support for the ARM architecture.

Support for the Prometheus receiver for metrics collection.

Support for the Kafka receiver and exporter for sending traces and metrics to Kafka.

Support for cluster-wide proxy environments.

The Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator creates the Prometheus ServiceMonitor custom resource if the Prometheus exporter is enabled.

The Operator enables the Instrumentation custom resource that allows injecting upstream OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation libraries.
Removal notice
In Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry 3.0, the Jaeger exporter has been removed. Bug fixes and support are provided only through the end of the 2.9 lifecycle. As an alternative to the Jaeger exporter for sending data to the Jaeger collector, you can use the OTLP exporter instead.
Bug fixes
This update introduces the following bug fixes:

Fixed support for disconnected environments when using the oc adm catalog mirror CLI command.
Known issues
There is currently a known issue:

Curently, the cluster monitoring of the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator is disabled due to a bug (TRACING-3761). The bug is preventing the cluster monitoring from scraping metrics from the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator due to a missing label openshift.io/cluster-monitoring=true that is required for the cluster monitoring and service monitor object.

Making open source more inclusive
Red Hat is committed to replacing problematic language in our code, documentation, and web properties. We are beginning with these four terms: master, slave, blacklist, and whitelist. Because of the enormity of this endeavor, these changes will be implemented gradually over several upcoming releases. For more details, see our CTO Chris Wright's message.
