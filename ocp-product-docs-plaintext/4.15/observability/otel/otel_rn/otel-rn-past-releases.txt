Release notes for past releases of Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing data collection

Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing data collection overview
Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing data collection is based on the open source OpenTelemetry project, which aims to provide unified, standardized, and vendor-neutral telemetry data collection for cloud-native software. Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing data collection product provides support for deploying and managing the OpenTelemetry Collector and simplifying the workload instrumentation.

The OpenTelemetry Collector can receive, process, and forward telemetry data in multiple formats, making it the ideal component for telemetry processing and interoperability between telemetry systems. The Collector provides a unified solution for collecting and processing metrics, traces, and logs.

The OpenTelemetry Collector has a number of features including the following:


Data Collection and Processing Hub
It acts as a central component that gathers telemetry data like metrics and traces from various sources. This data can be created from instrumented applications and infrastructure.
Customizable telemetry data pipeline
The OpenTelemetry Collector is designed to be customizable. It supports various processors, exporters, and receivers.
Auto-instrumentation features
Automatic instrumentation simplifies the process of adding observability to applications. Developers don't need to manually instrument their code for basic telemetry data.


Here are some of the use cases for the OpenTelemetry Collector:


Centralized data collection
In a microservices architecture, the Collector can be deployed to aggregate data from multiple services.
Data enrichment and processing
Before forwarding data to analysis tools, the Collector can enrich, filter, and process this data.
Multi-backend receiving and exporting
The Collector can receive and send data to multiple monitoring and analysis platforms simultaneously.
Release notes for Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing data collection 3.1
The Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing data collection is provided through the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing data collection Operator.

Technology Preview features
This update introduces the following Technology Preview feature:

The target allocator is an optional component of the OpenTelemetry Operator that shards Prometheus receiver scrape targets across the deployed fleet of OpenTelemetry Collector instances. The target allocator provides integration with the Prometheus PodMonitor and ServiceMonitor custom resources.


The target allocator is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

Making open source more inclusive
Red Hat is committed to replacing problematic language in our code, documentation, and web properties. We are beginning with these four terms: master, slave, blacklist, and whitelist. Because of the enormity of this endeavor, these changes will be implemented gradually over several upcoming releases. For more details, see our CTO Chris Wright's message.
