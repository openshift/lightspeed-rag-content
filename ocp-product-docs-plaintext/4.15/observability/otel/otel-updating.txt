Updating the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry

For version upgrades, the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator uses the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), which controls installation, upgrade, and role-based access control (RBAC) of Operators in a cluster.

The OLM runs in the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" by default. The OLM queries for available Operators as well as upgrades for installed Operators.

When the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator is upgraded to the new version, it scans for running OpenTelemetry Collector instances that it manages and upgrades them to the version corresponding to the Operator's new version.
