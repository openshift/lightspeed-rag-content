Upgrading

For version upgrades, the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing data collection Operator uses the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), which controls installation, upgrade, and role-based access control (RBAC) of Operators in a cluster.

The OLM runs in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform by default. The OLM queries for available Operators as well as upgrades for installed Operators.

When the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing data collection Operator is upgraded to the new version, it scans for running OpenTelemetry Collector instances that it manages and upgrades them to the version corresponding to the Operator's new version.
