Configuring the Collector

The Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing data collection Operator uses a custom resource definition (CRD) file that defines the architecture and configuration settings to be used when creating and deploying the distributed tracing data collection resources. You can install the default configuration or modify the file.
OpenTelemetry Collector configuration options
The OpenTelemetry Collector consists of five types of components that access telemetry data:


Receivers
A receiver, which can be push or pull based, is how data gets into the Collector. Generally, a receiver accepts data in a specified format, translates it into the internal format, and passes it to processors and exporters defined in the applicable pipelines. By default, no receivers are configured. One or more receivers must be configured. Receivers may support one or more data sources.
Processors
Optional. Processors process the data between it is received and exported. By default, no processors are enabled. Processors must be enabled for every data source. Not all processors support all data sources. Depending on the data source, multiple processors might be enabled. Note that the order of processors matters.
Exporters
An exporter, which can be push or pull based, is how you send data to one or more back ends or destinations. By default, no exporters are configured. One or more exporters must be configured. Exporters can support one or more data sources. Exporters might be used with their default settings, but many exporters require configuration to specify at least the destination and security settings.
Connectors
A connector connects two pipelines. It consumes data as an exporter at the end of one pipeline and emits data as a receiver at the start of another pipeline. It can consume and emit data of the same or different data type. It can generate and emit data to summarize the consumed data, or it can merely replicate or route data.
Extensions
An extension adds capabilities to the Collector. For example, authentication can be added to the receivers and exporters automatically.


You can define multiple instances of components in a custom resource YAML file. When configured, these components must be enabled through pipelines defined in the spec.config.service section of the YAML file. As a best practice, only enable the components that you need.

Processors
Processors run through the data between it is received and exported.

Batch processor
The Batch processor batches traces and metrics to reduce the number of outgoing connections needed to transfer the telemetry information.

  config: |
    processor:
      batch:
        timeout: 5s
        send_batch_max_size: 10000

          processors: [batch]
        metrics:
          processors: [batch]
Memory Limiter processor
The Memory Limiter processor periodically checks the Collector's memory usage and pauses data processing when the soft memory limit is reached. This processor supports traces, metrics, and logs. The preceding component, which is typically a receiver, is expected to retry sending the same data and may apply a backpressure to the incoming data. When memory usage exceeds the hard limit, the Memory Limiter processor forces garbage collection to run.

  config: |
    processor:
      memory_limiter:
        check_interval: 1s
        limit_mib: 4000
        spike_limit_mib: 800
    service:
      pipelines:
        traces:
          processors: [batch]
        metrics:
          processors: [batch]
Resource Detection processor
The Resource Detection processor is currently a Technology Preview feature only.

The Resource Detection processor identifies host resource details in alignment with OpenTelemetry's resource semantic standards. Using the detected information, it can add or replace the resource values in telemetry data. This processor supports traces, metrics, and can be used with multiple detectors such as the Docket metadata detector or the OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES environment variable detector.

kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: otel-collector
rules:
- apiGroups: ["config.openshift.io"]
  resources: ["infrastructures", "infrastructures/status"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
  config: |
    processor:
      resourcedetection:
        detectors: [openshift]
        override: true
    service:
      pipelines:
        traces:
          processors: [resourcedetection]
        metrics:
          processors: [resourcedetection]
  config: |
    processors:
      resourcedetection/env:
        detectors: [env] 1
        timeout: 2s
        override: false
Specifies which detector to use. In this example, the environment detector is specified.
Attributes processor
The Attributes processor is currently a Technology Preview feature only.

The Attributes processor can modify attributes of a span, log, or metric. You can configure this processor to filter and match input data and include or exclude such data for specific actions.

The processor operates on a list of actions, executing them in the order specified in the configuration. The following actions are supported:


Insert
Inserts a new attribute into the input data when the specified key does not already exist.
Update
Updates an attribute in the input data if the key already exists.
Upsert
Combines the insert and update actions: Inserts a new attribute if the key does not exist yet. Updates the attribute if the key already exists.
Delete
Removes an attribute from the input data.
Hash
Hashes an existing attribute value as SHA1.
Extract
Extracts values by using a regular expression rule from the input key to the target keys defined in the rule. If a target key already exists, it will be overridden similarly to the Span processor's to_attributes setting with the existing attribute as the source.
Convert
Converts an existing attribute to a specified type.


  config: |
    processors:
      attributes/example:
        actions:
          - key: db.table
            action: delete
          - key: redacted_span
            value: true
            action: upsert
          - key: copy_key
            from_attribute: key_original
            action: update
          - key: account_id
            value: 2245
            action: insert
          - key: account_password
            action: delete
          - key: account_email
            action: hash
          - key: http.status_code
            action: convert
            converted_type: int
Resource processor
The Resource processor is currently a Technology Preview feature only.

The Resource processor applies changes to the resource attributes. This processor supports traces, metrics, and logs.

  config: |
    processor:
      attributes:
      - key: cloud.availability_zone
        value: "zone-1"
        action: upsert
      - key: k8s.cluster.name
        from_attribute: k8s-cluster
        action: insert
      - key: redundant-attribute
        action: delete
Attributes represent the actions that are applied to the resource attributes, such as delete the attribute, insert the attribute, or upsert the attribute.
Span processor
The Span processor is currently a Technology Preview feature only.

The Span processor modifies the span name based on its attributes or extracts the span attributes from the span name. It can also change the span status. It can also include or exclude spans. This processor supports traces.

Span renaming requires specifying attributes for the new name by using the from_attributes configuration.

  config: |
    processor:
      span:
        name:
          from_attributes: [<key1>, <key2>, ...] 1
          separator: <value> 2
Defines the keys to form the new span name.

An optional separator.


You can use the processor to extract attributes from the span name.

  config: |
    processor:
      span/to_attributes:
        name:
          to_attributes:
            rules:
              - ^\/api\/v1\/document\/(?P<documentId>.*)\/update$ 1
This rule defines how the extraction is to be executed. You can define more rules: for example, in this case, if the regular expression matches the name, a documentID attibute is created. In this example, if the input span name is /api/v1/document/12345678/update, this results in the /api/v1/document/{documentId}/update output span name, and a new "documentId"="12345678" attribute is added to the span.


You can have the span status modified.

  config: |
    processor:
      span/set_status:
        status:
          code: Error
          description: "<error_description>"
Kubernetes Attributes processor
The Kubernetes Attributes processor is currently a Technology Preview feature only.

The Kubernetes Attributes processor enables automatic configuration of spans, metrics, and log resource attributes by using the Kubernetes metadata. This processor supports traces, metrics, and logs. This processor automatically identifies the Kubernetes resources, extracts the metadata from them, and incorporates this extracted metadata as resource attributes into relevant spans, metrics, and logs. It utilizes the Kubernetes API to discover all pods operating within a cluster, maintaining records of their IP addresses, pod UIDs, and other relevant metadata.

kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: otel-collector
rules:
  - apiGroups: ['']
    resources: ['pods', 'namespaces']
    verbs: ['get', 'watch', 'list']
  config: |
    processors:
         k8sattributes:
             filter:
                 node_from_env_var: KUBE_NODE_NAME
Filter processor
The Filter processor is currently a Technology Preview feature only.

The Filter processor leverages the OpenTelemetry Transformation Language to establish criteria for discarding telemetry data. If any of these conditions are satisfied, the telemetry data are discarded. The conditions can be combined by using the logical OR operator. This processor supports traces, metrics, and logs.

config: |
  processors:
    filter/ottl:
      error_mode: ignore 1
      traces:
        span:
          - 'attributes["container.name"] == "app_container_1"' 2
          - 'resource.attributes["host.name"] == "localhost"' 3
Defines the error mode. When set to ignore, ignores errors returned by conditions. When set to propagate, returns the error up the pipeline. An error causes the payload to be dropped from the Collector.

Filters the spans that have the container.name == app_container_1 attribute.

Filters the spans that have the host.name == localhost resource attribute.
Routing processor
The Routing processor is currently a Technology Preview feature only.

The Routing processor routes logs, metrics, or traces to specific exporters. This processor can read a header from an incoming HTTP request (gRPC or plain HTTP) or can read a resource attribute, and then directs the trace information to relevant exporters according to the read value.

config: |
  processors:
    routing:
      from_attribute: X-Tenant 1
      default_exporters: 2
      - jaeger
      table: 3
      - value: acme
        exporters: [jaeger/acme]
  exporters:
    jaeger:
      endpoint: localhost:14250
    jaeger/acme:
      endpoint: localhost:24250
The HTTP header name for the lookup value when performing the route.

The default exporter when the attribute value is not present in the table in the next section.

The table that defines which values are to be routed to which exporters.


You can optionally create an attribute_source configuratiion, which defines where to look for the attribute in from_attribute. The allowed value is context to search the context, which includes the HTTP headers, or resource to search the resource attributes.
Exporters
Exporters send data to one or more back ends or destinations.
