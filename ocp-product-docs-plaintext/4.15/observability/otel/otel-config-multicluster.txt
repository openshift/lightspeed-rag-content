Gathering the observability data from multiple clusters
For a multicluster configuration, you can create one OpenTelemetry Collector instance in each one of the remote clusters and then forward all the telemetry data to one OpenTelemetry Collector instance.

The Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing data collection Operator is installed.

The Tempo Operator is installed.

A TempoStack instance is deployed on the cluster.

The following mounted certificates: Issuer, self-signed certificate, CA issuer, client and server certificates. To create any of these certificates, see step 1.


Mount the following certificates in the OpenTelemetry Collector instance, skipping already mounted certificates.

Create a service account for the OpenTelemetry Collector instance.

Create a cluster role for the service account.

Bind the cluster role to the service account.

Create the YAML file to define the OpenTelemetryCollector custom resource (CR) in the edge clusters.

Create the YAML file to define the OpenTelemetryCollector custom resource (CR) in the central cluster.
