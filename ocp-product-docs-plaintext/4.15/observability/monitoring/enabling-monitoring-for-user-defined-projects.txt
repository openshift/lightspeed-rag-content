Enabling monitoring for user-defined projects

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15, you can enable monitoring for user-defined projects in addition to the default platform monitoring. You can monitor your own projects in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform without the need for an additional monitoring solution. Using this feature centralizes monitoring for core platform components and user-defined projects.

Versions of Prometheus Operator installed using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) are not compatible with user-defined monitoring. Therefore, custom Prometheus instances installed as a Prometheus custom resource (CR) managed by the OLM Prometheus Operator are not supported in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
Enabling monitoring for user-defined projects
Cluster administrators can enable monitoring for user-defined projects by setting the enableUserWorkload: true field in the cluster monitoring ConfigMap object.

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15 you must remove any custom Prometheus instances before enabling monitoring for user-defined projects.
You must have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role to enable monitoring for user-defined projects in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. Cluster administrators can then optionally grant users permission to configure the components that are responsible for monitoring user-defined projects.
You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role.

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You have created the cluster-monitoring-config ConfigMap object.

You have optionally created and configured the user-workload-monitoring-config ConfigMap object in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project. You can add configuration options to this ConfigMap object for the components that monitor user-defined projects.


Edit the cluster-monitoring-config ConfigMap object:

Add enableUserWorkload: true under data/config.yaml:

Save the file to apply the changes. Monitoring for user-defined projects is then enabled automatically.

Verify that the prometheus-operator, prometheus-user-workload, and thanos-ruler-user-workload pods are running in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project. It might take a short while for the pods to start:

Configuring the monitoring stack

Granting users permission to configure monitoring for user-defined projects
Granting users permission to monitor user-defined projects
Cluster administrators can monitor all core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and user-defined projects.

Cluster administrators can grant developers and other users permission to monitor their own projects. Privileges are granted by assigning one of the following monitoring roles:

The monitoring-rules-view cluster role provides read access to PrometheusRule custom resources for a project.

The monitoring-rules-edit cluster role grants a user permission to create, modify, and delete PrometheusRule custom resources for a project. It also grants a user the ability to silence alerts.

The monitoring-edit cluster role grants the same privileges as the monitoring-rules-edit cluster role. Additionally, it enables a user to create new scrape targets for services or pods. With this role, you can also create, modify, and delete ServiceMonitor and PodMonitor resources.


You can also grant users permission to configure the components that are responsible for monitoring user-defined projects:

The user-workload-monitoring-config-edit role in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project enables you to edit the user-workload-monitoring-config ConfigMap object. With this role, you can edit the ConfigMap object to configure Prometheus, Prometheus Operator, and Thanos Ruler for user-defined workload monitoring.


You can also grant users permission to configure alert routing for user-defined projects:

The alert-routing-edit cluster role grants a user permission to create, update, and delete AlertmanagerConfig custom resources for a project.


This section provides details on how to assign these roles by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console or the CLI.

Granting user permissions by using the web console
You can grant users permissions to monitor their own projects, by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role.

The user account that you are assigning the role to already exists.


In the Administrator perspective within the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, navigate to User Management -> RoleBindings -> Create binding.

In the Binding Type section, select the "Namespace Role Binding" type.

In the Name field, enter a name for the role binding.

In the Namespace field, select the user-defined project where you want to grant the access.

Select monitoring-rules-view, monitoring-rules-edit, or monitoring-edit in the Role Name list.

In the Subject section, select User.

In the Subject Name field, enter the name of the user.

Select Create to apply the role binding.
Granting user permissions by using the CLI
You can grant users permissions to monitor their own projects, by using the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role.

The user account that you are assigning the role to already exists.

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).


Assign a monitoring role to a user for a project:
Granting users permission to configure monitoring for user-defined projects
As a cluster administrator, you can assign the user-workload-monitoring-config-edit role to a user. This grants permission to configure and manage monitoring for user-defined projects without giving them permission to configure and manage core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring components.

You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role.

The user account that you are assigning the role to already exists.

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).


Assign the user-workload-monitoring-config-edit role to a user in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project:

Verify that the user is correctly assigned to the user-workload-monitoring-config-edit role by displaying the related role binding:
Accessing metrics from outside the cluster for custom applications
You can query Prometheus metrics from outside the cluster when monitoring your own services with user-defined projects. Access this data from outside the cluster by using the thanos-querier route.

This access only supports using a Bearer Token for authentication.

You have deployed your own service, following the "Enabling monitoring for user-defined projects" procedure.

You are logged in to an account with the cluster-monitoring-view cluster role, which provides permission to access the Thanos Querier API.

You are logged in to an account that has permission to get the Thanos Querier API route.


Extract an authentication token to connect to Prometheus by running the following command:

Extract the thanos-querier API route URL by running the following command:

Set the namespace to the namespace in which your service is running by using the following command:

Query the metrics of your own services in the command line by running the following command:


Enabling monitoring for user-defined projects
Excluding a user-defined project from monitoring
Individual user-defined projects can be excluded from user workload monitoring. To do so, add the openshift.io/user-monitoring label to the project's namespace with a value of false.

Add the label to the project namespace:

To re-enable monitoring, remove the label from the namespace:
Disabling monitoring for user-defined projects
After enabling monitoring for user-defined projects, you can disable it again by setting enableUserWorkload: false in the cluster monitoring ConfigMap object.

Alternatively, you can remove enableUserWorkload: true to disable monitoring for user-defined projects.
Edit the cluster-monitoring-config ConfigMap object:

Save the file to apply the changes. Monitoring for user-defined projects is then disabled automatically.

Check that the prometheus-operator, prometheus-user-workload and thanos-ruler-user-workload pods are terminated in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project. This might take a short while:


The user-workload-monitoring-config ConfigMap object in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project is not automatically deleted when monitoring for user-defined projects is disabled. This is to preserve any custom configurations that you may have created in the ConfigMap object.
