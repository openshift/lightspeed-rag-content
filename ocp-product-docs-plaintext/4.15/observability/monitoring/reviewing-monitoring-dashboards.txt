Reviewing monitoring dashboards

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15 provides a comprehensive set of monitoring dashboards that help you understand the state of cluster components and user-defined workloads.

Use the Administrator perspective to access dashboards for the core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform components, including the following items:

API performance

etcd

Kubernetes compute resources

Kubernetes network resources

Prometheus

USE method dashboards relating to cluster and node performance

Node performance metrics



Use the Developer perspective to access Kubernetes compute resources dashboards that provide the following application metrics for a selected project:

CPU usage

Memory usage

Bandwidth information

Packet rate information



In the Developer perspective, you can view dashboards for only one project at a time.
Reviewing monitoring dashboards as a cluster administrator
