# Configuring performance and scalability for user workload monitoring


You can configure the monitoring stack to optimize the performance and scale of your clusters. The following documentation provides information about how to distribute the monitoring components and control the impact of the monitoring stack on CPU and memory resources.

# Controlling the placement and distribution of monitoring components

You can move the monitoring stack components to specific nodes:

* Use the nodeSelector constraint with labeled nodes to move any of the monitoring stack components to specific nodes.
* Assign tolerations to enable moving components to tainted nodes.

By doing so, you control the placement and distribution of the monitoring components across a cluster.

By controlling placement and distribution of monitoring components, you can optimize system resource use, improve performance, and separate workloads based on specific requirements or policies.

* Using node selectors to move monitoring components

## Moving monitoring components to different nodes

You can move any of the components that monitor workloads for user-defined projects to specific worker nodes.


[WARNING]
----
It is not permitted to move components to control plane or infrastructure nodes.
----

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role or as a user with the user-workload-monitoring-config-edit role in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project.
* A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. If you have not done so yet, add a label to the nodes on which you want to run the monitoring components:

```terminal
$ oc label nodes <node_name> <node_label> 1
```

Replace <node_name> with the name of the node where you want to add the label.
Replace <node_label> with the name of the wanted label.
2. Edit the {configmap-name} ConfigMap object in the {namespace-name} project:

```terminal
$ oc -n {namespace-name} edit configmap {configmap-name}
```

3. Specify the node labels for the nodeSelector constraint for the component under data/config.yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {configmap-name}
  namespace: {namespace-name}
data:
  config.yaml: |
    # ...
    <component>: 1
      nodeSelector:
        <node_label_1> 2
        <node_label_2> 3
    # ...
```

Substitute <component> with the appropriate monitoring stack component name.
Substitute <node_label_1> with the label you added to the node.
Optional: Specify additional labels.
If you specify additional labels, the pods for the component are only scheduled on the nodes that contain all of the specified labels.

[NOTE]
----
If monitoring components remain in a Pending state after configuring the nodeSelector constraint, check the pod events for errors relating to taints and tolerations.
----
4. Save the file to apply the changes. The components specified in the new configuration are automatically moved to the new nodes, and the pods affected by the new configuration are redeployed.

* Understanding how to update labels on nodes
* Placing pods on specific nodes using node selectors
* nodeSelector (Kubernetes documentation)

## Assigning tolerations to monitoring components

You can assign tolerations to the components that monitor user-defined projects, to enable moving them to tainted worker nodes. Scheduling is not permitted on control plane or infrastructure nodes.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role, or as a user with the user-workload-monitoring-config-edit role in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project.
* A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Edit the {configmap-name} config map in the {namespace-name} project:

```terminal
$ oc -n {namespace-name} edit configmap {configmap-name}
```

2. Specify tolerations for the component:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {configmap-name}
  namespace: {namespace-name}
data:
  config.yaml: |
    <component>:
      tolerations:
        <toleration_specification>
```


Substitute <component> and <toleration_specification> accordingly.

For example, oc adm taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoSchedule adds a taint to node1 with the key key1 and the value value1. This prevents monitoring components from deploying pods on node1 unless a toleration is configured for that taint. The following example configures the {component} component to tolerate the example taint:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {configmap-name}
  namespace: {namespace-name}
data:
  config.yaml: |
    {component}:
      tolerations:
      - key: "key1"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: "value1"
        effect: "NoSchedule"
```

3. Save the file to apply the changes. The pods affected by the new configuration are automatically redeployed.

# Managing CPU and memory resources for monitoring components

You can ensure that the containers that run monitoring components have enough CPU and memory resources by specifying values for resource limits and requests for those components.

You can configure these limits and requests for monitoring components that monitor user-defined projects in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring namespace.

## Specifying limits and requests

To configure CPU and memory resources, specify values for resource limits and requests in the {configmap-name} ConfigMap object in the {namespace-name} namespace.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role, or as a user with the user-workload-monitoring-config-edit role in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Edit the {configmap-name} config map in the {namespace-name} project:

```terminal
$ oc -n {namespace-name} edit configmap {configmap-name}
```

2. Add values to define resource limits and requests for each component you want to configure.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Ensure that the value set for a limit is always higher than the value set for a request.
Otherwise, an error will occur, and the container will not run.
----
Example of setting resource limits and requests

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {configmap-name}
  namespace: {namespace-name}
data:
  config.yaml: |
    {alertmanager}:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: 500m
          memory: 1Gi
        requests:
          cpu: 200m
          memory: 500Mi
    {prometheus}:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: 500m
          memory: 3Gi
        requests:
          cpu: 200m
          memory: 500Mi
    {thanos}:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: 500m
          memory: 1Gi
        requests:
          cpu: 200m
          memory: 500Mi
```

3. Save the file to apply the changes. The pods affected by the new configuration are automatically redeployed.

# Controlling the impact of unbound metrics attributes in user-defined projects

Cluster administrators
can use the following measures to control the impact of unbound metrics attributes in user-defined projects:

* Limit the number of samples that can be accepted per target scrape in user-defined projects
* Limit the number of scraped labels, the length of label names, and the length of label values
* Create alerts that fire when a scrape sample threshold is reached or when the target cannot be scraped


[NOTE]
----
Limiting scrape samples can help prevent the issues caused by adding many unbound attributes to labels. Developers can also prevent the underlying cause by limiting the number of unbound attributes that they define for metrics. Using attributes that are bound to a limited set of possible values reduces the number of potential key-value pair combinations.

* Determining why Prometheus is consuming a lot of disk space

## Setting scrape sample and label limits for user-defined projects

You can limit the number of samples that can be accepted per target scrape in user-defined projects. You can also limit the number of scraped labels, the length of label names, and the length of label values.


[WARNING]
----
If you set sample or label limits, no further sample data is ingested for that target scrape after the limit is reached.
----

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role, or as a user with the user-workload-monitoring-config-edit role in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project.
* A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Edit the user-workload-monitoring-config ConfigMap object in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring edit configmap user-workload-monitoring-config
```

2. Add the enforcedSampleLimit configuration to data/config.yaml to limit the number of samples that can be accepted per target scrape in user-defined projects:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheus:
      enforcedSampleLimit: 50000 1
```

A value is required if this parameter is specified. This enforcedSampleLimit example limits the number of samples that can be accepted per target scrape in user-defined projects to 50,000.
3. Add the enforcedLabelLimit, enforcedLabelNameLengthLimit, and enforcedLabelValueLengthLimit configurations to data/config.yaml to limit the number of scraped labels, the length of label names, and the length of label values in user-defined projects:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheus:
      enforcedLabelLimit: 500 1
      enforcedLabelNameLengthLimit: 50 2
      enforcedLabelValueLengthLimit: 600 3
```

Specifies the maximum number of labels per scrape.
The default value is 0, which specifies no limit.
Specifies the maximum length in characters of a label name.
The default value is 0, which specifies no limit.
Specifies the maximum length in characters of a label value.
The default value is 0, which specifies no limit.
4. Save the file to apply the changes. The limits are applied automatically.

## Creating scrape sample alerts

You can create alerts that notify you when:

* The target cannot be scraped or is not available for the specified for duration
* A scrape sample threshold is reached or is exceeded for the specified for duration

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role, or as a user with the user-workload-monitoring-config-edit role in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project.
* A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You have limited the number of samples that can be accepted per target scrape in user-defined projects, by using enforcedSampleLimit.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Create a YAML file with alerts that inform you when the targets are down and when the enforced sample limit is approaching. The file in this example is called monitoring-stack-alerts.yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  labels:
    prometheus: k8s
    role: alert-rules
  name: monitoring-stack-alerts 1
  namespace: ns1 2
spec:
  groups:
  - name: general.rules
    rules:
    - alert: TargetDown 3
      annotations:
        message: '{{ printf "%.4g" $value }}% of the {{ $labels.job }}/{{ $labels.service
          }} targets in {{ $labels.namespace }} namespace are down.' 4
      expr: 100 * (count(up == 0) BY (job, namespace, service) / count(up) BY (job,
        namespace, service)) > 10
      for: 10m 5
      labels:
        severity: warning 6
    - alert: ApproachingEnforcedSamplesLimit 7
      annotations:
        message: '{{ $labels.container }} container of the {{ $labels.pod }} pod in the {{ $labels.namespace }} namespace consumes {{ $value | humanizePercentage }} of the samples limit budget.' 8
      expr: scrape_samples_scraped/50000 > 0.8 9
      for: 10m 10
      labels:
        severity: warning 11
```

Defines the name of the alerting rule.
Specifies the user-defined project where the alerting rule will be deployed.
The TargetDown alert will fire if the target cannot be scraped or is not available for the for duration.
The message that will be output when the TargetDown alert fires.
The conditions for the TargetDown alert must be true for this duration before the alert is fired.
Defines the severity for the TargetDown alert.
The ApproachingEnforcedSamplesLimit alert will fire when the defined scrape sample threshold is reached or exceeded for the specified for duration.
The message that will be output when the ApproachingEnforcedSamplesLimit alert fires.
The threshold for the ApproachingEnforcedSamplesLimit alert. In this example the alert will fire when the number of samples per target scrape has exceeded 80% of the enforced sample limit of 50000. The for duration must also have passed before the alert will fire. The <number> in the expression scrape_samples_scraped/<number> > <threshold> must match the enforcedSampleLimit value defined in the user-workload-monitoring-config ConfigMap object.
The conditions for the ApproachingEnforcedSamplesLimit alert must be true for this duration before the alert is fired.
Defines the severity for the ApproachingEnforcedSamplesLimit alert.
2. Apply the configuration to the user-defined project:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f monitoring-stack-alerts.yaml
```


# Configuring pod topology spread constraints

You can configure pod topology spread constraints for
all the pods for user-defined monitoring
to control how pod replicas are scheduled to nodes across zones.
This ensures that the pods are highly available and run more efficiently, because workloads are spread across nodes in different data centers or hierarchical infrastructure zones.

You can configure pod topology spread constraints for monitoring pods by using the {configmap-name} config map.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role or as a user with the user-workload-monitoring-config-edit role in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project.
* A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Edit the {configmap-name} config map in the {namespace-name} project:

```terminal
$ oc -n {namespace-name} edit configmap {configmap-name}
```

2. Add the following settings under the data/config.yaml field to configure pod topology spread constraints:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {configmap-name}
  namespace: {namespace-name}
data:
  config.yaml: |
    <component>: 1
      topologySpreadConstraints:
      - maxSkew: <n> 2
        topologyKey: <key> 3
        whenUnsatisfiable: <value> 4
        labelSelector: 5
          <match_option>
```

Specify a name of the component for which you want to set up pod topology spread constraints.
Specify a numeric value for maxSkew, which defines the degree to which pods are allowed to be unevenly distributed.
Specify a key of node labels for topologyKey.
Nodes that have a label with this key and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.
The scheduler tries to put a balanced number of pods into each domain.
Specify a value for whenUnsatisfiable.
Available options are DoNotSchedule and ScheduleAnyway.
Specify DoNotSchedule if you want the maxSkew value to define the maximum difference allowed between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
Specify ScheduleAnyway if you want the scheduler to still schedule the pod but to give higher priority to nodes that might reduce the skew.
Specify labelSelector to find matching pods.
Pods that match this label selector are counted to determine the number of pods in their corresponding topology domain.
Example configuration for {component-name}

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {configmap-name}
  namespace: {namespace-name}
data:
  config.yaml: |
    {component}:
      topologySpreadConstraints:
      - maxSkew: 1
        topologyKey: monitoring
        whenUnsatisfiable: ScheduleAnyway
        labelSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app.kubernetes.io/name: {label}
```

3. Save the file to apply the changes. The pods affected by the new configuration are automatically redeployed.
