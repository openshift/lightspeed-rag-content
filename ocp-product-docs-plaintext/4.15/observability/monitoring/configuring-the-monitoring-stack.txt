# Configuring the monitoring stack


The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program provides only a low number of configuration options before installation. Configuring most Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform framework components, including the cluster monitoring stack, happens after the installation.
This section explains what configuration is supported,
shows how to configure the monitoring stack,
and demonstrates several common configuration scenarios.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Not all configuration parameters for the monitoring stack are exposed.
Only the parameters and fields listed in the Config map reference for the Cluster Monitoring Operator are supported for configuration.
----

# Prerequisites

* The monitoring stack imposes additional resource requirements. Consult the computing resources recommendations in Scaling the Cluster Monitoring Operator and verify that you have sufficient resources.

# Maintenance and support for monitoring

Not all configuration options for the monitoring stack are exposed. The only supported way of configuring Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring is by configuring the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO) using the options described in the Config map reference for the Cluster Monitoring Operator. Do not use other configurations, as they are unsupported.

Configuration paradigms might change across Prometheus releases, and such cases can only be handled gracefully if all configuration possibilities are controlled. If you use configurations other than those described in the Config map reference for the Cluster Monitoring Operator, your changes will disappear because the CMO automatically reconciles any differences and resets any unsupported changes back to the originally defined state by default and by design.

## Support considerations for monitoring


[NOTE]
----
Backward compatibility for metrics, recording rules, or alerting rules is not guaranteed.
----

The following modifications are explicitly not supported:

* Creating additional ServiceMonitor, PodMonitor, and PrometheusRule objects in the openshift-&#42; and kube-&#42; projects.
* Modifying any resources or objects deployed in the openshift-monitoring or openshift-user-workload-monitoring projects. The resources created by the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring stack are not meant to be used by any other resources, as there are no guarantees about their backward compatibility.

[NOTE]
----
The Alertmanager configuration is deployed as the alertmanager-main secret resource in the openshift-monitoring namespace.
If you have enabled a separate Alertmanager instance for user-defined alert routing, an Alertmanager configuration is also deployed as the alertmanager-user-workload secret resource in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring namespace.
To configure additional routes for any instance of Alertmanager, you need to decode, modify, and then encode that secret.
This procedure is a supported exception to the preceding statement.
----
* Modifying resources of the stack. The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring stack ensures its resources are always in the state it expects them to be. If they are modified, the stack will reset them.
* Deploying user-defined workloads to openshift-&#42;, and kube-&#42; projects. These projects are reserved for Red Hat provided components and they should not be used for user-defined workloads.
* Enabling symptom based monitoring by using the Probe custom resource definition (CRD) in Prometheus Operator.
* Manually deploying monitoring resources into namespaces that have the openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true" label.
* Adding the openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true" label to namespaces. This label is reserved only for the namespaces with core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform components and Red Hat certified components.
* Installing custom Prometheus instances on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. A custom instance is a Prometheus custom resource (CR) managed by the Prometheus Operator.

## Support policy for monitoring Operators

Monitoring Operators ensure that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring resources function as designed and tested. If Cluster Version Operator (CVO) control of an Operator is overridden, the Operator does not respond to configuration changes, reconcile the intended state of cluster objects, or receive updates.

While overriding CVO control for an Operator can be helpful during debugging, this is  unsupported and the cluster administrator assumes full control of the individual component configurations and upgrades.

The spec.overrides parameter can be added to the configuration for the CVO to allow administrators to provide a list of overrides to the behavior of the CVO for a component. Setting the spec.overrides[].unmanaged parameter to true for a component blocks cluster upgrades and alerts the administrator after a CVO override has been set:


```terminal
Disabling ownership via cluster version overrides prevents upgrades. Please remove overrides before continuing.
```



[WARNING]
----
Setting a CVO override puts the entire cluster in an unsupported state and prevents the monitoring stack from being reconciled to its intended state. This impacts the reliability features built into Operators and prevents updates from being received. Reported issues must be reproduced after removing any overrides for support to proceed.
----

## Support version matrix for monitoring components

The following matrix contains information about versions of monitoring components for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 and later releases:




[NOTE]
----
The openshift-state-metrics agent and Telemeter Client are OpenShift-specific components. Therefore, their versions correspond with the versions of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
----

# Preparing to configure the monitoring stack

You can configure the monitoring stack by creating and updating monitoring config maps. These config maps configure the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO), which in turn configures the components of the monitoring stack.

## Creating a cluster monitoring config map

You can configure the core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring components by creating the cluster-monitoring-config ConfigMap object in the openshift-monitoring project. The Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO) then configures the core components of the monitoring stack.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Check whether the cluster-monitoring-config ConfigMap object exists:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring get configmap cluster-monitoring-config
```

2. If the ConfigMap object does not exist:
1. Create the following YAML manifest. In this example the file is called cluster-monitoring-config.yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
```

2. Apply the configuration to create the ConfigMap object:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f cluster-monitoring-config.yaml
```


## Creating a user-defined workload monitoring config map

You can configure the user workload monitoring components with the user-workload-monitoring-config ConfigMap object in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project. The Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO) then configures the components that monitor user-defined projects.


[NOTE]
----
* If you enable monitoring for user-defined projects, the user-workload-monitoring-config ConfigMap object is created by default.
* When you save your changes to the user-workload-monitoring-config ConfigMap object, some or all of the pods in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project might be redeployed. It can sometimes take a while for these components to redeploy.
----

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Check whether the user-workload-monitoring-config ConfigMap object exists:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring get configmap user-workload-monitoring-config
```

2. If the user-workload-monitoring-config ConfigMap object does not exist:
1. Create the following YAML manifest. In this example the file is called user-workload-monitoring-config.yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
```

2. Apply the configuration to create the ConfigMap object:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f user-workload-monitoring-config.yaml
```


[NOTE]
----
Configurations applied to the user-workload-monitoring-config ConfigMap object are not activated unless a cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
----

# Configuring the monitoring stack

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15, you can configure the monitoring stack using the cluster-monitoring-config or user-workload-monitoring-config ConfigMap objects. Config maps configure the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO), which in turn configures the components of the stack.

* If you are configuring core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring components:
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role.
* You have created the cluster-monitoring-config ConfigMap object.
* If you are configuring components that monitor user-defined projects:
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role, or as a user with the user-workload-monitoring-config-edit role in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project.
* A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Edit the ConfigMap object.
* To configure core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring components:
1. Edit the cluster-monitoring-config ConfigMap object in the openshift-monitoring project:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
```

2. Add your configuration under data/config.yaml as a key-value pair <component_name>: <component_configuration>:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    <component>:
      <configuration_for_the_component>
```


Substitute <component> and <configuration_for_the_component> accordingly.

The following example ConfigMap object configures a persistent volume claim (PVC) for Prometheus. This relates to the Prometheus instance that monitors core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform components only:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s: 1
      volumeClaimTemplate:
        spec:
          storageClassName: fast
          volumeMode: Filesystem
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: 40Gi
```

Defines the Prometheus component and the subsequent lines define its configuration.
* To configure components that monitor user-defined projects:
1. Edit the user-workload-monitoring-config ConfigMap object in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring edit configmap user-workload-monitoring-config
```

2. Add your configuration under data/config.yaml as a key-value pair <component_name>: <component_configuration>:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    <component>:
      <configuration_for_the_component>
```


Substitute <component> and <configuration_for_the_component> accordingly.

The following example ConfigMap object configures a data retention period and minimum container resource requests for Prometheus. This relates to the Prometheus instance that monitors user-defined projects only:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheus: 1
      retention: 24h 2
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 200m 3
          memory: 2Gi 4
```

Defines the Prometheus component and the subsequent lines define its configuration.
Configures a twenty-four hour data retention period for the Prometheus instance that monitors user-defined projects.
Defines a minimum resource request of 200 millicores for the Prometheus container.
Defines a minimum pod resource request of 2 GiB of memory for the Prometheus container.

[NOTE]
----
The Prometheus config map component is called prometheusK8s in the cluster-monitoring-config ConfigMap object and prometheus in the user-workload-monitoring-config ConfigMap object.
----
2. Save the file to apply the changes to the ConfigMap object.

[WARNING]
----
Different configuration changes to the ConfigMap object result in different outcomes:
* The pods are not redeployed. Therefore, there is no service outage.
* The affected pods are redeployed:
* For single-node clusters, this results in temporary service outage.
* For multi-node clusters, because of high-availability, the affected pods are gradually rolled out and the monitoring stack remains available.
* Configuring and resizing a persistent volume always results in a service outage, regardless of high availability.
Each procedure that requires a change in the config map includes its expected outcome.

# Using node selectors to move monitoring components

By using the nodeSelector constraint with labeled nodes, you can move any of the monitoring stack components to specific nodes.
By doing so, you can control the placement and distribution of the monitoring components across a cluster.

By controlling placement and distribution of monitoring components, you can optimize system resource use, improve performance, and segregate workloads based on specific requirements or policies.

## How node selectors work with other constraints

If you move monitoring components by using node selector constraints, be aware that other constraints to control pod scheduling might exist for a cluster:

* Topology spread constraints might be in place to control pod placement.
* Hard anti-affinity rules are in place for Prometheus, Thanos Querier, Alertmanager, and other monitoring components to ensure that multiple pods for these components are always spread across different nodes and are therefore always highly available.

When scheduling pods onto nodes, the pod scheduler tries to satisfy all existing constraints when determining pod placement.
That is, all constraints compound when the pod scheduler determines which pods will be placed on which nodes.

Therefore, if you configure a node selector constraint but existing constraints cannot all be satisfied, the pod scheduler cannot match all constraints and will not schedule a pod for placement onto a node.

To maintain resilience and high availability for monitoring components, ensure that enough nodes are available and match all constraints when you configure a node selector constraint to move a component.

## Moving monitoring components to different nodes

To specify the nodes in your cluster on which monitoring stack components will run, configure the nodeSelector constraint in the component&#8217;s ConfigMap object to match labels assigned to the nodes.


[NOTE]
----
You cannot add a node selector constraint directly to an existing scheduled pod.
----

* If you are configuring core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring components:
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role.
* You have created the cluster-monitoring-config ConfigMap object.
* If you are configuring components that monitor user-defined projects:
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role or as a user with the user-workload-monitoring-config-edit role in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project.
* A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. If you have not done so yet, add a label to the nodes on which you want to run the monitoring components:

```terminal
$ oc label nodes <node-name> <node-label>
```

2. Edit the ConfigMap object:
* To move a component that monitors core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform projects:
1. Edit the cluster-monitoring-config ConfigMap object in the openshift-monitoring project:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
```

2. Specify the node labels for the nodeSelector constraint for the component under data/config.yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    <component>: 1
      nodeSelector:
        <node-label-1> 2
        <node-label-2> 3
        <...>
```

Substitute <component> with the appropriate monitoring stack component name.
Substitute <node-label-1> with the label you added to the node.
Optional: Specify additional labels.
If you specify additional labels, the pods for the component are only scheduled on the nodes that contain all of the specified labels.

[NOTE]
----
If monitoring components remain in a Pending state after configuring the nodeSelector constraint, check the pod events for errors relating to taints and tolerations.
----
* To move a component that monitors user-defined projects:
1. Edit the user-workload-monitoring-config ConfigMap object in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring edit configmap user-workload-monitoring-config
```

2. Specify the node labels for the nodeSelector constraint for the component under data/config.yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    <component>: 1
      nodeSelector:
        <node-label-1> 2
        <node-label-2> 3
        <...>
```

Substitute <component> with the appropriate monitoring stack component name.
Substitute <node-label-1> with the label you added to the node.
Optional: Specify additional labels.
If you specify additional labels, the pods for the component are only scheduled on the nodes that contain all of the specified labels.

[NOTE]
----
If monitoring components remain in a Pending state after configuring the nodeSelector constraint, check the pod events for errors relating to taints and tolerations.
----
3. Save the file to apply the changes. The components specified in the new configuration are automatically moved to the new nodes, and the pods affected by the new configuration are redeployed.

# Assigning tolerations to monitoring components

You can assign tolerations to any of the monitoring stack components to enable moving them to tainted nodes.

* If you are configuring core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring components:
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role.
* You have created the cluster-monitoring-config ConfigMap object.
* If you are configuring components that monitor user-defined projects:
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role, or as a user with the user-workload-monitoring-config-edit role in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project.
* A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Edit the ConfigMap object:
* To assign tolerations to a component that monitors core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform projects:
1. Edit the cluster-monitoring-config ConfigMap object in the openshift-monitoring project:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
```

2. Specify tolerations for the component:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    <component>:
      tolerations:
        <toleration_specification>
```


Substitute <component> and <toleration_specification> accordingly.

For example, oc adm taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoSchedule adds a taint to node1 with the key key1 and the value value1. This prevents monitoring components from deploying pods on node1 unless a toleration is configured for that taint. The following example configures the alertmanagerMain component to tolerate the example taint:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    alertmanagerMain:
      tolerations:
      - key: "key1"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: "value1"
        effect: "NoSchedule"
```

* To assign tolerations to a component that monitors user-defined projects:
1. Edit the user-workload-monitoring-config ConfigMap object in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring edit configmap user-workload-monitoring-config
```

2. Specify tolerations for the component:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    <component>:
      tolerations:
        <toleration_specification>
```


Substitute <component> and <toleration_specification> accordingly.

For example, oc adm taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoSchedule adds a taint to node1 with the key key1 and the value value1. This prevents monitoring components from deploying pods on node1 unless a toleration is configured for that taint. The following example configures the thanosRuler component to tolerate the example taint:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    thanosRuler:
      tolerations:
      - key: "key1"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: "value1"
        effect: "NoSchedule"
```

2. Save the file to apply the changes. The pods affected by the new configuration are automatically redeployed.

# Setting the body size limit for metrics scraping

By default, no limit exists for the uncompressed body size for data returned from scraped metrics targets.
You can set a body size limit to help avoid situations in which Prometheus consumes excessive amounts of memory when scraped targets return a response that contains a large amount of data.
In addition, by setting a body size limit, you can reduce the impact that a malicious target might have on Prometheus and on the cluster as a whole.

After you set a value for enforcedBodySizeLimit, the alert PrometheusScrapeBodySizeLimitHit fires when at least one Prometheus scrape target replies with a response body larger than the configured value.


[NOTE]
----
If metrics data scraped from a target has an uncompressed body size exceeding the configured size limit, the scrape fails.
Prometheus then considers this target to be down and sets its up metric value to 0, which can trigger the TargetDown alert.
----

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Edit the cluster-monitoring-config ConfigMap object in the openshift-monitoring namespace:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
```

2. Add a value for enforcedBodySizeLimit to data/config.yaml/prometheusK8s to limit the body size that can be accepted per target scrape:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |-
    prometheusK8s:
      enforcedBodySizeLimit: 40MB 1
```

Specify the maximum body size for scraped metrics targets.
This enforcedBodySizeLimit example limits the uncompressed size per target scrape to 40 megabytes.
Valid numeric values use the Prometheus data size format: B (bytes), KB (kilobytes), MB (megabytes), GB (gigabytes), TB (terabytes), PB (petabytes), and EB (exabytes).
The default value is 0, which specifies no limit.
You can also set the value to automatic to calculate the limit automatically based on cluster capacity.
3. Save the file to apply the changes. The new configuration is applied automatically.

# Managing CPU and memory resources for monitoring components

You can ensure that the containers that run monitoring components have enough CPU and memory resources by specifying values for resource limits and requests for those components.

You can configure these limits and requests for core platform monitoring components in the openshift-monitoring namespace and for the components that monitor user-defined projects in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring namespace.

## About specifying limits and requests for monitoring components

You can configure resource limits and request settings for core platform monitoring components and for the components that monitor user-defined projects, including the following components:

* Alertmanager (for core platform monitoring and for user-defined projects)
* kube-state-metrics
* monitoring-plugin
* node-exporter
* openshift-state-metrics
* Prometheus (for core platform monitoring and for user-defined projects)
* Prometheus Adapter
* Prometheus Operator and its admission webhook service
* Telemeter Client
* Thanos Querier
* Thanos Ruler

By defining resource limits, you limit a container&#8217;s resource usage, which prevents the container from exceeding the specified maximum values for CPU and memory resources.

By defining resource requests, you specify that a container can be scheduled only on a node that has enough CPU and memory resources available to match the requested resources.

## Specifying limits and requests for monitoring components

To configure CPU and memory resources, specify values for resource limits and requests in the appropriate ConfigMap object for the namespace in which the monitoring component is located:

* The cluster-monitoring-config config map in the openshift-monitoring namespace for core platform monitoring
* The user-workload-monitoring-config config map in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring namespace for components that monitor user-defined projects

* If you are configuring core platform monitoring components:
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role.
* You have created a ConfigMap object named cluster-monitoring-config.
* If you are configuring components that monitor user-defined projects:
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role, or as a user with the user-workload-monitoring-config-edit role in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. To configure core platform monitoring components, edit the cluster-monitoring-config config map object in the openshift-monitoring namespace:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
```

2. Add values to define resource limits and requests for each core platform monitoring component you want to configure.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Make sure that the value set for a limit is always higher than the value set for a request.
Otherwise, an error will occur, and the container will not run.

# Configuring persistent storage

Run cluster monitoring with persistent storage to gain the following benefits:

* Protect your metrics and alerting data from data loss by storing them in a persistent volume (PV). As a result, they can survive pods being restarted or recreated.
* Avoid getting duplicate notifications and losing silences for alerts when the Alertmanager pods are restarted.

For production environments, it is highly recommended to configure persistent storage.

## Persistent storage prerequisites

* Dedicate sufficient persistent storage to ensure that the disk does not become full.
* Use Filesystem as the storage type value for the volumeMode parameter when you configure the persistent volume.

[IMPORTANT]
----
* Do not use a raw block volume, which is described with volumeMode: Block in the PersistentVolume resource. Prometheus cannot use raw block volumes.
* Prometheus does not support file systems that are not POSIX compliant.
For example, some NFS file system implementations are not POSIX compliant.
If you want to use an NFS file system for storage, verify with the vendor that their NFS implementation is fully POSIX compliant.
----

## Configuring a persistent volume claim

To use a persistent volume (PV) for monitoring components, you must configure a persistent volume claim (PVC).

* If you are configuring core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring components:
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role.
* You have created the cluster-monitoring-config ConfigMap object.
* If you are configuring components that monitor user-defined projects:
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role, or as a user with the user-workload-monitoring-config-edit role in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project.
* A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Edit the ConfigMap object:
* To configure a PVC for a component that monitors core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform projects:
1. Edit the cluster-monitoring-config ConfigMap object in the openshift-monitoring project:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
```

2. Add your PVC configuration for the component under data/config.yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    <component>: 1
      volumeClaimTemplate:
        spec:
          storageClassName: <storage_class> 2
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: <amount_of_storage> 3
```

Specify the core monitoring component for which you want to configure the PVC.
Specify an existing storage class. If a storage class is not specified, the default storage class is used.
Specify the amount of required storage.

See the Kubernetes documentation on PersistentVolumeClaims for information on how to specify volumeClaimTemplate.

The following example configures a PVC that claims persistent storage for the Prometheus instance that monitors core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform components:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      volumeClaimTemplate:
        spec:
          storageClassName: my-storage-class
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: 40Gi
```

* To configure a PVC for a component that monitors user-defined projects:
1. Edit the user-workload-monitoring-config ConfigMap object in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring edit configmap user-workload-monitoring-config
```

2. Add your PVC configuration for the component under data/config.yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    <component>: 1
      volumeClaimTemplate:
        spec:
          storageClassName: <storage_class> 2
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: <amount_of_storage> 3
```

Specify the component for user-defined monitoring for which you want to configure the PVC.
Specify an existing storage class. If a storage class is not specified, the default storage class is used.
Specify the amount of required storage.

See the Kubernetes documentation on PersistentVolumeClaims for information on how to specify volumeClaimTemplate.

The following example configures a PVC that claims persistent storage for Thanos Ruler:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    thanosRuler:
      volumeClaimTemplate:
        spec:
          storageClassName: my-storage-class
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: 10Gi
```


[NOTE]
----
Storage requirements for the thanosRuler component depend on the number of rules that are evaluated and how many samples each rule generates.
----
2. Save the file to apply the changes. The pods affected by the new configuration are automatically redeployed and the new storage configuration is applied.

[WARNING]
----
When you update the config map with a PVC configuration, the affected StatefulSet object is recreated, resulting in a temporary service outage.
----

## Resizing a persistent volume

You can resize a persistent volume (PV) for monitoring components, such as Prometheus, Thanos Ruler, or Alertmanager. You need to manually expand a persistent volume claim (PVC), and then update the config map in which the component is configured.


[IMPORTANT]
----
You can only expand the size of the PVC. Shrinking the storage size is not possible.
----

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* If you are configuring core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring components:
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role.
* You have created the cluster-monitoring-config ConfigMap object.
* You have configured at least one PVC for core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring components.
* If you are configuring components that monitor user-defined projects:
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role, or as a user with the user-workload-monitoring-config-edit role in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project.
* A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You have configured at least one PVC for components that monitor user-defined projects.

1. Manually expand a PVC with the updated storage request. For more information, see "Expanding persistent volume claims (PVCs) with a file system" in Expanding persistent volumes.
2. Edit the ConfigMap object:
* If you are configuring core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring components:
1. Edit the cluster-monitoring-config ConfigMap object in the openshift-monitoring project:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
```

2. Add a new storage size for the PVC configuration for the component under data/config.yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    <component>: 1
      volumeClaimTemplate:
        spec:
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: <amount_of_storage> 2
```

The component for which you want to change the storage size.
Specify the new size for the storage volume. It must be greater than the previous value.

The following example sets the new PVC request to 100 gigabytes for the Prometheus instance that monitors core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform components:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      volumeClaimTemplate:
        spec:
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: 100Gi
```

* If you are configuring components that monitor user-defined projects:

[NOTE]
----
You can resize the volumes for the Thanos Ruler and for instances of Alertmanager and Prometheus that monitor user-defined projects.
----
1. Edit the user-workload-monitoring-config ConfigMap object in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring edit configmap user-workload-monitoring-config
```

2. Update the PVC configuration for the monitoring component under data/config.yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    <component>: 1
      volumeClaimTemplate:
        spec:
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: <amount_of_storage> 2
```

The component for which you want to change the storage size.
Specify the new size for the storage volume. It must be greater than the previous value.

The following example sets the new PVC request to 20 gigabytes for Thanos Ruler:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    thanosRuler:
      volumeClaimTemplate:
        spec:
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: 20Gi
```


[NOTE]
----
Storage requirements for the thanosRuler component depend on the number of rules that are evaluated and how many samples each rule generates.

## Modifying the retention time and size for Prometheus metrics data

By default, Prometheus retains metrics data for the following durations:

* Core platform monitoring: 15 days
* Monitoring for user-defined projects: 24 hours

You can modify the retention time for
Prometheus
to change how soon the data is deleted. You can also set the maximum amount of disk space the retained metrics data uses. If the data reaches this size limit, Prometheus deletes the oldest data first until the disk space used is again below the limit.

Note the following behaviors of these data retention settings:

* The size-based retention policy applies to all data block directories in the /prometheus directory, including persistent blocks, write-ahead log (WAL) data, and m-mapped chunks.
* Data in the /wal and /head_chunks directories counts toward the retention size limit, but Prometheus never purges data from these directories based on size- or time-based retention policies.
Thus, if you set a retention size limit lower than the maximum size set for the /wal and /head_chunks directories, you have configured the system not to retain any data blocks in the /prometheus data directories.
* The size-based retention policy is applied only when Prometheus cuts a new data block, which occurs every two hours after the WAL contains at least three hours of data.
* If you do not explicitly define values for either retention or retentionSize, retention time defaults to 15 days for core platform monitoring and 24 hours for user-defined project monitoring. Retention size is not set.
* If you define values for both retention and retentionSize, both values apply.
If any data blocks exceed the defined retention time or the defined size limit, Prometheus purges these data blocks.
* If you define a value for retentionSize and do not define retention, only the retentionSize value applies.
* If you do not define a value for retentionSize and only define a value for retention, only the retention value applies.
* If you set the retentionSize or retention value to 0, the default settings apply. The default settings set retention time to 15 days for core platform monitoring and 24 hours for user-defined project monitoring. By default, retention size is not set.


[NOTE]
----
Data compaction occurs every two hours. Therefore, a persistent volume (PV) might fill up before compaction, potentially exceeding the retentionSize limit. In such cases, the KubePersistentVolumeFillingUp alert fires until the space on a PV is lower than the retentionSize limit.
----

* If you are configuring core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring components:
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role.
* You have created the cluster-monitoring-config ConfigMap object.
* If you are configuring components that monitor user-defined projects:
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role, or as a user with the user-workload-monitoring-config-edit role in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project.
* A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Edit the ConfigMap object:
* To modify the retention time and size for the Prometheus instance that monitors core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform projects:
1. Edit the cluster-monitoring-config ConfigMap object in the openshift-monitoring project:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
```

2. Add the retention time and size configuration under data/config.yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      retention: <time_specification> 1
      retentionSize: <size_specification> 2
```

The retention time: a number directly followed by ms (milliseconds), s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks), or y (years). You can also combine time values for specific times, such as 1h30m15s.
The retention size: a number directly followed by B (bytes), KB (kilobytes), MB (megabytes), GB (gigabytes), TB (terabytes), PB (petabytes), and EB (exabytes).

The following example sets the retention time to 24 hours and the retention size to 10 gigabytes for the Prometheus instance that monitors core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform components:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      retention: 24h
      retentionSize: 10GB
```

* To modify the retention time and size for the Prometheus instance that monitors user-defined projects:
1. Edit the user-workload-monitoring-config ConfigMap object in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring edit configmap user-workload-monitoring-config
```

2. Add the retention time and size configuration under data/config.yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheus:
      retention: <time_specification> 1
      retentionSize: <size_specification> 2
```

The retention time: a number directly followed by ms (milliseconds), s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks), or y (years).
You can also combine time values for specific times, such as 1h30m15s.
The retention size: a number directly followed by B (bytes), KB (kilobytes), MB (megabytes), GB (gigabytes), TB (terabytes), PB (petabytes), or EB (exabytes).

The following example sets the retention time to 24 hours and the retention size to 10 gigabytes for the Prometheus instance that monitors user-defined projects:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheus:
      retention: 24h
      retentionSize: 10GB
```

2. Save the file to apply the changes. The pods affected by the new configuration are automatically redeployed.

## Modifying the retention time for Thanos Ruler metrics data

By default, for user-defined projects, Thanos Ruler automatically retains metrics data for 24 hours. You can modify the retention time to change how long this data is retained by specifying a time value in the user-workload-monitoring-config config map in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring namespace.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role or as a user with the user-workload-monitoring-config-edit role in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project.
* A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Edit the user-workload-monitoring-config ConfigMap object in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring edit configmap user-workload-monitoring-config
```

2. Add the retention time configuration under data/config.yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    thanosRuler:
      retention: <time_specification> 1
```

Specify the retention time in the following format: a number directly followed by ms (milliseconds), s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks), or y (years).
You can also combine time values for specific times, such as 1h30m15s.
The default is 24h.

The following example sets the retention time to 10 days for Thanos Ruler data:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    thanosRuler:
      retention: 10d
```

# Configuring remote write storage

You can configure remote write storage to enable Prometheus to send ingested metrics to remote systems for long-term storage. Doing so has no impact on how or for how long Prometheus stores metrics.

* If you are configuring core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring components:
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role.
* You have created the cluster-monitoring-config ConfigMap object.
* If you are configuring components that monitor user-defined projects:
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role or as a user with the user-workload-monitoring-config-edit role in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project.
* A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have set up a remote write compatible endpoint (such as Thanos) and know the endpoint URL. See the Prometheus remote endpoints and storage documentation for information about endpoints that are compatible with the remote write feature.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Red Hat only provides information for configuring remote write senders and does not offer guidance on configuring receiver endpoints. Customers are responsible for setting up their own endpoints that are remote-write compatible. Issues with endpoint receiver configurations are not included in Red Hat production support.
----
* You have set up authentication credentials in a Secret object for the remote write endpoint. You must create the secret in the
same namespace as the Prometheus object for which you configure remote write: the openshift-monitoring namespace for default platform monitoring or the openshift-user-workload-monitoring namespace for user workload monitoring.

[WARNING]
----
To reduce security risks, use HTTPS and authentication to send metrics to an endpoint.
----

1. Edit the ConfigMap object:
* To configure remote write for the Prometheus instance that monitors core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform projects:
1. Edit the cluster-monitoring-config ConfigMap object in the openshift-monitoring project:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
```

2. Add a remoteWrite: section under data/config.yaml/prometheusK8s.
3. Add an endpoint URL and authentication credentials in this section:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      remoteWrite:
      - url: "https://remote-write-endpoint.example.com" 1
        <endpoint_authentication_credentials> 2
```

The URL of the remote write endpoint.
The authentication method and credentials for the endpoint.
Currently supported authentication methods are AWS Signature Version 4, authentication using HTTP in an Authorization request header, Basic authentication, OAuth 2.0, and TLS client.
See Supported remote write authentication settings for sample configurations of supported authentication methods.
4. Add write relabel configuration values after the authentication credentials:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      remoteWrite:
      - url: "https://remote-write-endpoint.example.com"
        <endpoint_authentication_credentials>
        <your_write_relabel_configs> 1
```

The write relabel configuration settings.

For <your_write_relabel_configs> substitute a list of write relabel configurations for metrics that you want to send to the remote endpoint.

The following sample shows how to forward a single metric called my_metric:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      remoteWrite:
      - url: "https://remote-write-endpoint.example.com"
        writeRelabelConfigs:
        - sourceLabels: [__name__]
          regex: 'my_metric'
          action: keep
```


See the Prometheus relabel_config documentation for information about write relabel configuration options.
* To configure remote write for the Prometheus instance that monitors user-defined projects:
1. Edit the user-workload-monitoring-config ConfigMap object in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring edit configmap user-workload-monitoring-config
```

2. Add a remoteWrite: section under data/config.yaml/prometheus.
3. Add an endpoint URL and authentication credentials in this section:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheus:
      remoteWrite:
      - url: "https://remote-write-endpoint.example.com" 1
        <endpoint_authentication_credentials> 2
```

The URL of the remote write endpoint.
The authentication method and credentials for the endpoint.
Currently supported authentication methods are AWS Signature Version 4, authentication using HTTP an Authorization request header, basic authentication, OAuth 2.0, and TLS client.
See Supported remote write authentication settings below for sample configurations of supported authentication methods.
4. Add write relabel configuration values after the authentication credentials:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheus:
      remoteWrite:
      - url: "https://remote-write-endpoint.example.com"
        <endpoint_authentication_credentials>
        <your_write_relabel_configs> 1
```

The write relabel configuration settings.

For <your_write_relabel_configs> substitute a list of write relabel configurations for metrics that you want to send to the remote endpoint.

The following sample shows how to forward a single metric called my_metric:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheus:
      remoteWrite:
      - url: "https://remote-write-endpoint.example.com"
        writeRelabelConfigs:
        - sourceLabels: [__name__]
          regex: 'my_metric'
          action: keep
```


See the Prometheus relabel_config documentation for information about write relabel configuration options.
2. Save the file to apply the changes. The new configuration is applied automatically.

## Supported remote write authentication settings

You can use different methods to authenticate with a remote write endpoint. Currently supported authentication methods are AWS Signature Version 4, basic authentication, authorization, OAuth 2.0, and TLS client. The following table provides details about supported authentication methods for use with remote write.



## Example remote write authentication settings

The following samples show different authentication settings you can use to connect to a remote write endpoint. Each sample also shows how to configure a corresponding Secret object that contains authentication credentials and other relevant settings. Each sample configures authentication for use with
default platform monitoring
in the {namespace-name} namespace.

The following shows the settings for a sigv4 secret named sigv4-credentials in the {namespace-name} namespace.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: sigv4-credentials
  namespace: {namespace-name}
stringData:
  accessKey: <AWS_access_key> 1
  secretKey: <AWS_secret_key> 2
type: Opaque
```

The AWS API access key.
The AWS API secret key.
The following shows sample AWS Signature Version 4 remote write authentication settings that use a Secret object named sigv4-credentials in the {namespace-name} namespace:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {configmap-name}
  namespace: {namespace-name}
data:
  config.yaml: |
    {prometheus-instance}:
      remoteWrite:
      - url: "https://authorization.example.com/api/write"
        sigv4:
          region: <AWS_region> 1
          accessKey:
            name: sigv4-credentials 2
            key: accessKey 3
          secretKey:
            name: sigv4-credentials 2
            key: secretKey 4
          profile: <AWS_profile_name> 5
          roleArn: <AWS_role_arn> 6
```

The AWS region.
The name of the Secret object containing the AWS API access credentials.
The key that contains the AWS API access key in the specified Secret object.
The key that contains the AWS API secret key in the specified Secret object.
The name of the AWS profile that is being used to authenticate.
The unique identifier for the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) assigned to your role.

The following shows sample basic authentication settings for a Secret object named rw-basic-auth in the {namespace-name} namespace:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: rw-basic-auth
  namespace: {namespace-name}
stringData:
  user: <basic_username> 1
  password: <basic_password> 2
type: Opaque
```

The username.
The password.
The following sample shows a basicAuth remote write configuration that uses a Secret object named rw-basic-auth in the {namespace-name} namespace.
It assumes that you have already set up authentication credentials for the endpoint.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {configmap-name}
  namespace: {namespace-name}
data:
  config.yaml: |
    {prometheus-instance}:
      remoteWrite:

# Adding cluster ID labels to metrics

If you manage multiple Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters and use the remote write feature to send metrics data from these clusters to an external storage location, you can add cluster ID labels to identify the metrics data coming from different clusters. You can then query these labels to identify the source cluster for a metric and distinguish that data from similar metrics data sent by other clusters.

This way, if you manage many clusters for multiple customers and send metrics data to a single centralized storage system, you can use cluster ID labels to query metrics for a particular cluster or customer.

Creating and using cluster ID labels involves three general steps:

* Configuring the write relabel settings for remote write storage.
* Adding cluster ID labels to the metrics.
* Querying these labels to identify the source cluster or customer for a metric.

## Creating cluster ID labels for metrics

You can create cluster ID labels for metrics for default platform monitoring and for user workload monitoring.

For default platform monitoring, you add cluster ID labels for metrics in the write_relabel settings for remote write storage in the cluster-monitoring-config config map in the openshift-monitoring namespace.

For user workload monitoring, you edit the settings in the user-workload-monitoring-config config map in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring namespace.


[NOTE]
----
When Prometheus scrapes user workload targets that expose a namespace label, the system stores this label as exported_namespace.
This behavior ensures that the final namespace label value is equal to the namespace of the target pod.
You cannot override this default configuration by setting the value of the honorLabels field to true for PodMonitor or ServiceMonitor objects.
----

* If you are configuring default platform monitoring components:
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role.
* You have created the cluster-monitoring-config ConfigMap object.
* If you are configuring components that monitor user-defined projects:
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role or as a user with the user-workload-monitoring-config-edit role in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project.
* A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have configured remote write storage.

1. Edit the ConfigMap object:
* To create cluster ID labels for core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform metrics:
1. Edit the cluster-monitoring-config ConfigMap object in the openshift-monitoring project:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
```

2. In the writeRelabelConfigs: section under data/config.yaml/prometheusK8s/remoteWrite, add cluster ID relabel configuration values:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      remoteWrite:
      - url: "https://remote-write-endpoint.example.com"
        <endpoint_authentication_credentials>
        writeRelabelConfigs: 1
          - <relabel_config> 2
```

Add a list of write relabel configurations for metrics that you want to send to the remote endpoint.
Substitute the label configuration for the metrics sent to the remote write endpoint.

The following sample shows how to forward a metric with the cluster ID label cluster_id in default platform monitoring:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      remoteWrite:
      - url: "https://remote-write-endpoint.example.com"
        writeRelabelConfigs:
        - sourceLabels:
          - __tmp_openshift_cluster_id__ 1
          targetLabel: cluster_id 2
          action: replace 3
```

The system initially applies a temporary cluster ID source label named __tmp_openshift_cluster_id__. This temporary label gets replaced by the cluster ID label name that you specify.
Specify the name of the cluster ID label for metrics sent to remote write storage.
If you use a label name that already exists for a metric, that value is overwritten with the name of this cluster ID label.
For the label name, do not use __tmp_openshift_cluster_id__. The final relabeling step removes labels that use this name.
The replace write relabel action replaces the temporary label with the target label for outgoing metrics.
This action is the default and is applied if no action is specified.
* To create cluster ID labels for user-defined project metrics:
1. Edit the user-workload-monitoring-config ConfigMap object in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring edit configmap user-workload-monitoring-config
```

2. In the writeRelabelConfigs: section under data/config.yaml/prometheus/remoteWrite, add cluster ID relabel configuration values:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheus:
      remoteWrite:
      - url: "https://remote-write-endpoint.example.com"
        <endpoint_authentication_credentials>
        writeRelabelConfigs: 1
          - <relabel_config> 2
```

Add a list of write relabel configurations for metrics that you want to send to the remote endpoint.
Substitute the label configuration for the metrics sent to the remote write endpoint.

The following sample shows how to forward a metric with the cluster ID label cluster_id in user-workload monitoring:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheus:
      remoteWrite:
      - url: "https://remote-write-endpoint.example.com"
        writeRelabelConfigs:
        - sourceLabels:
          - __tmp_openshift_cluster_id__ 1
          targetLabel: cluster_id 2
          action: replace 3
```

The system initially applies a temporary cluster ID source label named __tmp_openshift_cluster_id__. This temporary label gets replaced by the cluster ID label name that you specify.
Specify the name of the cluster ID label for metrics sent to remote write storage. If you use a label name that already exists for a metric, that value is overwritten with the name of this cluster ID label. For the label name, do not use __tmp_openshift_cluster_id__. The final relabeling step removes labels that use this name.
The replace write relabel action replaces the temporary label with the target label for outgoing metrics. This action is the default and is applied if no action is specified.

# Configuring metrics collection profiles


[IMPORTANT]
----
Using a metrics collection profile is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete.
Red Hat does not recommend using them in production.
These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview.
----

By default, Prometheus collects metrics exposed by all default metrics targets in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform components.
However, you might want Prometheus to collect fewer metrics from a cluster in certain scenarios:

* If cluster administrators require only alert, telemetry, and console metrics and do not require other metrics to be available.
* If a cluster increases in size, and the increased size of the default metrics data collected now requires a significant increase in CPU and memory resources.

You can use a metrics collection profile to collect either the default amount of metrics data or a minimal amount of metrics data.
When you collect minimal metrics data, basic monitoring features such as alerting continue to work.
At the same time, the CPU and memory resources required by Prometheus decrease.

## About metrics collection profiles

You can enable one of two metrics collection profiles:

* full: Prometheus collects metrics data exposed by all platform components. This setting is the default.
* minimal: Prometheus collects only the metrics data required for platform alerts, recording rules, telemetry, and console dashboards.

## Choosing a metrics collection profile

To choose a metrics collection profile for core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring components, edit the cluster-monitoring-config ConfigMap object.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have enabled Technology Preview features by using the FeatureGate custom resource (CR).
* You have created the cluster-monitoring-config ConfigMap object.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role.

1. Edit the cluster-monitoring-config ConfigMap object in the openshift-monitoring project:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
```

2. Add the metrics collection profile setting under data/config.yaml/prometheusK8s:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      collectionProfile: <metrics_collection_profile_name> 1
```

The name of the metrics collection profile.
The available values are full or minimal.
If you do not specify a value or if the collectionProfile key name does not exist in the config map, the default setting of full is used.

The following example sets the metrics collection profile to minimal for the core platform instance of Prometheus:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      collectionProfile: minimal
```

3. Save the file to apply the changes. The new configuration is applied automatically.

# Controlling the impact of unbound metrics attributes in user-defined projects

Developers can create labels to define attributes for metrics in the form of key-value pairs. The number of potential key-value pairs corresponds to the number of possible values for an attribute. An attribute that has an unlimited number of potential values is called an unbound attribute. For example, a customer_id attribute is unbound because it has an infinite number of possible values.

Every assigned key-value pair has a unique time series. The use of many unbound attributes in labels can result in an exponential increase in the number of time series created. This can impact Prometheus performance and can consume a lot of disk space.

Cluster administrators
can use the following measures to control the impact of unbound metrics attributes in user-defined projects:

* Limit the number of samples that can be accepted per target scrape in user-defined projects
* Limit the number of scraped labels, the length of label names, and the length of label values
* Create alerts that fire when a scrape sample threshold is reached or when the target cannot be scraped


[NOTE]
----
Limiting scrape samples can help prevent the issues caused by adding many unbound attributes to labels. Developers can also prevent the underlying cause by limiting the number of unbound attributes that they define for metrics. Using attributes that are bound to a limited set of possible values reduces the number of potential key-value pair combinations.
----

## Setting scrape sample and label limits for user-defined projects

You can limit the number of samples that can be accepted per target scrape in user-defined projects. You can also limit the number of scraped labels, the length of label names, and the length of label values.


[WARNING]
----
If you set sample or label limits, no further sample data is ingested for that target scrape after the limit is reached.
----

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role, or as a user with the user-workload-monitoring-config-edit role in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project.
* A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Edit the user-workload-monitoring-config ConfigMap object in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring edit configmap user-workload-monitoring-config
```

2. Add the enforcedSampleLimit configuration to data/config.yaml to limit the number of samples that can be accepted per target scrape in user-defined projects:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheus:
      enforcedSampleLimit: 50000 1
```

A value is required if this parameter is specified. This enforcedSampleLimit example limits the number of samples that can be accepted per target scrape in user-defined projects to 50,000.
3. Add the enforcedLabelLimit, enforcedLabelNameLengthLimit, and enforcedLabelValueLengthLimit configurations to data/config.yaml to limit the number of scraped labels, the length of label names, and the length of label values in user-defined projects:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheus:
      enforcedLabelLimit: 500 1
      enforcedLabelNameLengthLimit: 50 2
      enforcedLabelValueLengthLimit: 600 3
```

Specifies the maximum number of labels per scrape.
The default value is 0, which specifies no limit.
Specifies the maximum length in characters of a label name.
The default value is 0, which specifies no limit.
Specifies the maximum length in characters of a label value.
The default value is 0, which specifies no limit.
4. Save the file to apply the changes. The limits are applied automatically.

## Creating scrape sample alerts

You can create alerts that notify you when:

* The target cannot be scraped or is not available for the specified for duration
* A scrape sample threshold is reached or is exceeded for the specified for duration

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role, or as a user with the user-workload-monitoring-config-edit role in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project.
* A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You have limited the number of samples that can be accepted per target scrape in user-defined projects, by using enforcedSampleLimit.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Create a YAML file with alerts that inform you when the targets are down and when the enforced sample limit is approaching. The file in this example is called monitoring-stack-alerts.yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  labels:
    prometheus: k8s
    role: alert-rules
  name: monitoring-stack-alerts 1
  namespace: ns1 2
spec:
  groups:
  - name: general.rules
    rules:
    - alert: TargetDown 3
      annotations:
        message: '{{ printf "%.4g" $value }}% of the {{ $labels.job }}/{{ $labels.service
          }} targets in {{ $labels.namespace }} namespace are down.' 4
      expr: 100 * (count(up == 0) BY (job, namespace, service) / count(up) BY (job,
        namespace, service)) > 10
      for: 10m 5
      labels:
        severity: warning 6
    - alert: ApproachingEnforcedSamplesLimit 7
      annotations:
        message: '{{ $labels.container }} container of the {{ $labels.pod }} pod in the {{ $labels.namespace }} namespace consumes {{ $value | humanizePercentage }} of the samples limit budget.' 8
      expr: scrape_samples_scraped/50000 > 0.8 9
      for: 10m 10
      labels:
        severity: warning 11
```

Defines the name of the alerting rule.
Specifies the user-defined project where the alerting rule will be deployed.
The TargetDown alert will fire if the target cannot be scraped or is not available for the for duration.
The message that will be output when the TargetDown alert fires.
The conditions for the TargetDown alert must be true for this duration before the alert is fired.
Defines the severity for the TargetDown alert.
The ApproachingEnforcedSamplesLimit alert will fire when the defined scrape sample threshold is reached or exceeded for the specified for duration.
The message that will be output when the ApproachingEnforcedSamplesLimit alert fires.
The threshold for the ApproachingEnforcedSamplesLimit alert. In this example the alert will fire when the number of samples per target scrape has exceeded 80% of the enforced sample limit of 50000. The for duration must also have passed before the alert will fire. The <number> in the expression scrape_samples_scraped/<number> > <threshold> must match the enforcedSampleLimit value defined in the user-workload-monitoring-config ConfigMap object.
The conditions for the ApproachingEnforcedSamplesLimit alert must be true for this duration before the alert is fired.
Defines the severity for the ApproachingEnforcedSamplesLimit alert.
2. Apply the configuration to the user-defined project:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f monitoring-stack-alerts.yaml
```

# Configuring external Alertmanager instances

The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring stack includes a local Alertmanager instance that routes alerts from Prometheus.
You can add external Alertmanager instances to route alerts for core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform projects or user-defined projects.

If you add the same external Alertmanager configuration for multiple clusters and disable the local instance for each cluster, you can then manage alert routing for multiple clusters by using a single external Alertmanager instance.

* If you are configuring core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring components in the openshift-monitoring project:
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role.
* You have created the cluster-monitoring-config config map.
* If you are configuring components that monitor user-defined projects:
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role, or as a user with the user-workload-monitoring-config-edit role in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project.
* A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Edit the ConfigMap object.
* To configure additional Alertmanagers for routing alerts from core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform projects:
1. Edit the cluster-monitoring-config config map in the openshift-monitoring project:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
```

2. Add an additionalAlertmanagerConfigs: section under data/config.yaml/prometheusK8s.
3. Add the configuration details for additional Alertmanagers in this section:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      additionalAlertmanagerConfigs:
      - <alertmanager_specification>
```


For <alertmanager_specification>, substitute authentication and other configuration details for additional Alertmanager instances.
Currently supported authentication methods are bearer token (bearerToken) and client TLS (tlsConfig).
The following sample config map configures an additional Alertmanager using a bearer token with client TLS authentication:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      additionalAlertmanagerConfigs:
      - scheme: https
        pathPrefix: /
        timeout: "30s"
        apiVersion: v1
        bearerToken:
          name: alertmanager-bearer-token
          key: token
        tlsConfig:
          key:
            name: alertmanager-tls
            key: tls.key
          cert:
            name: alertmanager-tls
            key: tls.crt
          ca:
            name: alertmanager-tls
            key: tls.ca
        staticConfigs:
        - external-alertmanager1-remote.com
        - external-alertmanager1-remote2.com
```

* To configure additional Alertmanager instances for routing alerts from user-defined projects:
1. Edit the user-workload-monitoring-config config map in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring edit configmap user-workload-monitoring-config
```

2. Add a <component>/additionalAlertmanagerConfigs: section under data/config.yaml/.
3. Add the configuration details for additional Alertmanagers in this section:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    <component>:
      additionalAlertmanagerConfigs:
      - <alertmanager_specification>
```


For <component>, substitute one of two supported external Alertmanager components: prometheus or thanosRuler.

For <alertmanager_specification>, substitute authentication and other configuration details for additional Alertmanager instances. Currently supported authentication methods are bearer token (bearerToken) and client TLS (tlsConfig). The following sample config map configures an additional Alertmanager using Thanos Ruler with a bearer token and client TLS authentication:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    thanosRuler:
      additionalAlertmanagerConfigs:
      - scheme: https
        pathPrefix: /
        timeout: "30s"
        apiVersion: v1
        bearerToken:
          name: alertmanager-bearer-token
          key: token
        tlsConfig:
          key:
            name: alertmanager-tls
            key: tls.key
          cert:
            name: alertmanager-tls
            key: tls.crt
          ca:
            name: alertmanager-tls

# Configuring secrets for Alertmanager

The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring stack includes Alertmanager, which routes alerts from Prometheus to endpoint receivers.
If you need to authenticate with a receiver so that Alertmanager can send alerts to it, you can configure Alertmanager to use a secret that contains authentication credentials for the receiver.

For example, you can configure Alertmanager to use a secret to authenticate with an endpoint receiver that requires a certificate issued by a private Certificate Authority (CA).
You can also configure Alertmanager to use a secret to authenticate with a receiver that requires a password file for Basic HTTP authentication.
In either case, authentication details are contained in the Secret object rather than in the ConfigMap object.

## Adding a secret to the Alertmanager configuration

You can add secrets to the Alertmanager configuration for core platform monitoring components by editing the cluster-monitoring-config config map in the openshift-monitoring project.

After you add a secret to the config map, the secret is mounted as a volume at /etc/alertmanager/secrets/<secret_name> within the alertmanager container for the Alertmanager pods.

* If you are configuring core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring components in the openshift-monitoring project:
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role.
* You have created the cluster-monitoring-config config map.
* You have created the secret to be configured in Alertmanager in the openshift-monitoring project.
* If you are configuring components that monitor user-defined projects:
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role, or as a user with the user-workload-monitoring-config-edit role in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project.
* You have created the secret to be configured in Alertmanager in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project.
* A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Edit the ConfigMap object.
* To add a secret configuration to Alertmanager for core platform monitoring:
1. Edit the cluster-monitoring-config config map in the openshift-monitoring project:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
```

2. Add a secrets: section under data/config.yaml/alertmanagerMain with the following configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    alertmanagerMain:
      secrets: 1
      - <secret_name_1> 2
      - <secret_name_2>
```

This section contains the secrets to be mounted into Alertmanager. The secrets must be located within the same namespace as the Alertmanager object.
The name of the Secret object that contains authentication credentials for the receiver. If you add multiple secrets, place each one on a new line.

The following sample config map settings configure Alertmanager to use two Secret objects named test-secret-basic-auth and test-secret-api-token:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    alertmanagerMain:
      secrets:
      - test-secret-basic-auth
      - test-secret-api-token
```

* To add a secret configuration to Alertmanager for user-defined project monitoring:
1. Edit the user-workload-monitoring-config config map in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring edit configmap user-workload-monitoring-config
```

2. Add a secrets: section under data/config.yaml/alertmanager/secrets with the following configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    alertmanager:
      secrets: 1
      - <secret_name_1> 2
      - <secret_name_2>
```

This section contains the secrets to be mounted into Alertmanager. The secrets must be located within the same namespace as the Alertmanager object.
The name of the Secret object that contains authentication credentials for the receiver. If you add multiple secrets, place each one on a new line.

The following sample config map settings configure Alertmanager to use two Secret objects named test-secret and test-secret-api-token:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    alertmanager:
      enabled: true
      secrets:
      - test-secret
      - test-api-receiver-token
```

2. Save the file to apply the changes. The new configuration is applied automatically.

# Attaching additional labels to your time series and alerts

You can attach custom labels to all time series and alerts leaving Prometheus by using the external labels feature of Prometheus.

* If you are configuring core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring components:
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role.
* You have created the cluster-monitoring-config ConfigMap object.
* If you are configuring components that monitor user-defined projects:
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role, or as a user with the user-workload-monitoring-config-edit role in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project.
* A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Edit the ConfigMap object:
* To attach custom labels to all time series and alerts leaving the Prometheus instance that monitors core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform projects:
1. Edit the cluster-monitoring-config ConfigMap object in the openshift-monitoring project:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
```

2. Define a map of labels you want to add for every metric under data/config.yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      externalLabels:
        <key>: <value> 1
```

Substitute <key>: <value> with a map of key-value pairs where <key> is a unique name for the new label and <value> is its value.

[WARNING]
----
* Do not use prometheus or prometheus_replica as key names, because they are reserved and will be overwritten.
* Do not use cluster or managed_cluster as key names. Using them can cause issues where you are unable to see data in the developer dashboards.
----

For example, to add metadata about the region and environment to all time series and alerts, use the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      externalLabels:
        region: eu
        environment: prod
```

3. Save the file to apply the changes. The new configuration is applied automatically.
* To attach custom labels to all time series and alerts leaving the Prometheus instance that monitors user-defined projects:
1. Edit the user-workload-monitoring-config ConfigMap object in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring edit configmap user-workload-monitoring-config
```

2. Define a map of labels you want to add for every metric under data/config.yaml:

  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheus:
      externalLabels:
        <key>: <value> 1
```

Substitute <key>: <value> with a map of key-value pairs where <key> is a unique name for the new label and <value> is its value.

[WARNING]
----
* Do not use prometheus or prometheus_replica as key names, because they are reserved and will be overwritten.
* Do not use cluster or managed_cluster as key names. Using them can cause issues where you are unable to see data in the developer dashboards.
----

[NOTE]
----
In the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project, Prometheus handles metrics and Thanos Ruler handles alerting and recording rules. Setting externalLabels for prometheus in the user-workload-monitoring-config ConfigMap object will only configure external labels for metrics and not for any rules.
----

For example, to add metadata about the region and environment to all time series and alerts related to user-defined projects, use the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheus:
      externalLabels:
        region: eu
        environment: prod
```

# Using pod topology spread constraints for monitoring

You can use pod topology spread constraints to control how
the monitoring pods
are spread across a network topology when Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform pods are deployed in multiple availability zones.

Pod topology spread constraints are suitable for controlling pod scheduling within hierarchical topologies in which nodes are spread across different infrastructure levels, such as regions and zones within those regions.
Additionally, by being able to schedule pods in different zones, you can improve network latency in certain scenarios.

* Controlling pod placement by using pod topology spread constraints
* Kubernetes Pod Topology Spread Constraints documentation

## Configuring pod topology spread constraints

You can configure pod topology spread constraints for
all the pods deployed by the Cluster Monitoring Operator
to control how pod replicas are scheduled to nodes across zones.
This ensures that the pods are highly available and run more efficiently, because workloads are spread across nodes in different data centers or hierarchical infrastructure zones.

You can configure pod topology spread constraints for monitoring pods by using
the cluster-monitoring-config or
the user-workload-monitoring-config config map.

* If you are configuring pods for core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring:
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role.
* You have created the cluster-monitoring-config ConfigMap object.
* If you are configuring pods for user-defined monitoring:
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role, or as a user with the user-workload-monitoring-config-edit role in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project.
* A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

* To configure pod topology spread constraints for core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring:
1. Edit the cluster-monitoring-config config map in the openshift-monitoring project:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
```

2. Add the following settings under the data/config.yaml field to configure pod topology spread constraints:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    <component>: 1
      topologySpreadConstraints:
      - maxSkew: <n> 2
        topologyKey: <key> 3
        whenUnsatisfiable: <value> 4
        labelSelector: 5
          <match_option>
```

Specify a name of the component for which you want to set up pod topology spread constraints.
Specify a numeric value for maxSkew, which defines the degree to which pods are allowed to be unevenly distributed.
Specify a key of node labels for topologyKey.
Nodes that have a label with this key and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.
The scheduler tries to put a balanced number of pods into each domain.
Specify a value for whenUnsatisfiable.
Available options are DoNotSchedule and ScheduleAnyway.
Specify DoNotSchedule if you want the maxSkew value to define the maximum difference allowed between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
Specify ScheduleAnyway if you want the scheduler to still schedule the pod but to give higher priority to nodes that might reduce the skew.
Specify labelSelector to find matching pods.
Pods that match this label selector are counted to determine the number of pods in their corresponding topology domain.
Example configuration for Prometheus

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      topologySpreadConstraints:

  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    k8sPrometheusAdapter:
      audit:
        profile: <audit_log_level> 1
```

The audit log level to apply to the Prometheus Adapter.
3. Set the audit log level by using one of the following values for the profile: parameter:
* None: Do not log events.
* Metadata: Log only the metadata for the request, such as user, timestamp, and so forth. Do not log the request text and the response text. Metadata is the default audit log level.
* Request: Log only the metadata and the request text but not the response text. This option does not apply for non-resource requests.
* RequestResponse: Log event metadata, request text, and response text. This option does not apply for non-resource requests.
4. Save the file to apply the changes. The pods affected by the new configuration are automatically redeployed.

1. In the config map, under k8sPrometheusAdapter/audit/profile, set the log level to Request and save the file.
2. Confirm that the pods for the Prometheus Adapter are running. The following example lists the status of pods in the openshift-monitoring project:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring get pods
```

3. Confirm that the audit log level and audit log file path are correctly configured:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring get deploy prometheus-adapter -o yaml
```

Example output

```terminal
...
  - --audit-policy-file=/etc/audit/request-profile.yaml
  - --audit-log-path=/var/log/adapter/audit.log
```

4. Confirm that the correct log level has been applied in the prometheus-adapter deployment in the openshift-monitoring project:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring exec deploy/prometheus-adapter -c prometheus-adapter -- cat /etc/audit/request-profile.yaml

"kind": "Policy"
"metadata":
  "name": "Request"
"omitStages":
- "RequestReceived"
"rules":
- "level": "Request"
```


[NOTE]
----
If you enter an unrecognized profile value for the Prometheus Adapter in the ConfigMap object, no changes are made to the Prometheus Adapter, and an error is logged by the Cluster Monitoring Operator.
----
5. Review the audit log for the Prometheus Adapter:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring exec -c <prometheus_adapter_pod_name> -- cat /var/log/adapter/audit.log
```

* You have created the cluster-monitoring-config config map.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Edit the cluster-monitoring-config config map in the openshift-monitoring project:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
```

2. Add enabled: false for the alertmanagerMain component under data/config.yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    alertmanagerMain:
      enabled: false
```

3. Save the file to apply the changes. The Alertmanager instance is disabled automatically when you apply the change.
