# Release notes



# Logging 6.0.2

This release includes RHBA-2024:10051.

## Bug fixes

* Before this update, Loki did not correctly load some configurations, which caused issues when using Alibaba Cloud or IBM Cloud object storage. This update fixes the configuration-loading code in Loki, resolving the issue. (LOG-5325)
* Before this update, the collector would discard audit log messages that exceeded the configured threshold. This modifies the audit configuration thresholds for the maximum line size as well as the number of bytes read during a read cycle. (LOG-5998)
* Before this update, the Cluster Logging Operator did not watch and reconcile resources associated with an instance of a ClusterLogForwarder like it did in prior releases. This update modifies the operator to watch and reconcile all resources it owns and creates. (LOG-6264)
* Before this update, log events with an unknown severity level sent to Google Cloud Logging would trigger a warning in the vector collector, which would then default the severity to 'DEFAULT'. With this update, log severity levels are now standardized to match Google Cloud Logging specifications, and audit logs are assigned a severity of 'INFO'. (LOG-6296)
* Before this update, when infrastructure namespaces were included in application inputs, the log_type was set as application. With this update, the log_type of infrastructure namespaces included in application inputs is set to infrastructure. (LOG-6354)
* Before this update, specifying a value for the syslog.enrichment field of the ClusterLogForwarder added namespace_name, container_name, and pod_name to the messages of non-container logs. With this update, only container logs include namespace_name, container_name, and pod_name in their messages when syslog.enrichment is set. (LOG-6402)

## CVEs

* CVE-2024-6119
* CVE-2024-6232

# Logging 6.0.1

This release includes OpenShift Logging Bug Fix Release 6.0.1.

## Bug fixes

* With this update, the default memory limit for the collector has been increased from 1024 Mi to 2024 Mi. However, users should always adjust their resource limits according to their cluster specifications and needs. (LOG-6180)
* Before this update, the Loki Operator failed to add the default namespace label to all AlertingRule resources, which caused the User-Workload-Monitoring Alertmanager to skip routing these alerts. This update adds the rule namespace as a label to all alerting and recording rules, resolving the issue and restoring proper alert routing in Alertmanager.
(LOG-6151)
* Before this update, the LokiStack ruler component view did not initialize properly, causing an invalid field error when the ruler component was disabled. This update ensures that the component view initializes with an empty value, resolving the issue.
(LOG-6129)
* Before this update, it was possible to set log_source in the prune filter, which could lead to inconsistent log data. With this update, the configuration is validated before being applied, and any configuration that includes log_source in the prune filter is rejected.
(LOG-6202)

# Logging 6.0.0

This release includes Logging for Red Hat OpenShift Bug Fix Release 6.0.0


[NOTE]
----
Logging is provided as an installable component, with a distinct release cycle from the core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy outlines release compatibility.
----



# Removal notice

* With this release, logging no longer supports the ClusterLogging.logging.openshift.io and ClusterLogForwarder.logging.openshift.io custom resources. Refer to the product documentation for details on the replacement features. (LOG-5803)
* With this release, logging no longer manages or deploys log storage (such as Elasticsearch), visualization (such as Kibana), or Fluentd-based log collectors. (LOG-5368)


[NOTE]
----
In order to continue to use Elasticsearch and Kibana managed by the elasticsearch-operator, the administrator must modify those object's ownerRefs before deleting the ClusterLogging resource.
----

# New features and enhancements

* This feature introduces a new architecture for logging for Red Hat OpenShift by shifting component responsibilities to their relevant Operators, such as for storage, visualization, and collection. It introduces the ClusterLogForwarder.observability.openshift.io API for log collection and forwarding. Support for the ClusterLogging.logging.openshift.io and ClusterLogForwarder.logging.openshift.io APIs, along with the Red Hat managed Elastic stack (Elasticsearch and Kibana), is removed. Users are encouraged to migrate to the Red Hat LokiStack for log storage. Existing managed Elasticsearch deployments can be used for a limited time. Automated migration for log collection is not provided, so administrators need to create a new ClusterLogForwarder.observability.openshift.io specification to replace their previous custom resources. Refer to the official product documentation for more details. (LOG-3493)
* With this release, the responsibility for deploying the logging view plugin shifts from the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator to the Cluster Observability Operator (COO). For new log storage installations that need visualization, the Cluster Observability Operator and the associated UIPlugin resource must be deployed. Refer to the Cluster Observability Operator Overview product documentation for more details. (LOG-5461)
* This enhancement sets default requests and limits for Vector collector deployments' memory and CPU usage based on Vector documentation recommendations. (LOG-4745)
* This enhancement updates Vector to align with the upstream version v0.37.1. (LOG-5296)
* This enhancement introduces an alert that triggers when log collectors buffer logs to a node's file system and use over 15% of the available space, indicating potential back pressure issues. (LOG-5381)
* This enhancement updates the selectors for all components to use common Kubernetes labels. (LOG-5906)
* This enhancement changes the collector configuration to deploy as a ConfigMap instead of a secret, allowing users to view and edit the configuration when the ClusterLogForwarder is set to Unmanaged. (LOG-5599)
* This enhancement adds the ability to configure the Vector collector log level using an annotation on the ClusterLogForwarder, with options including trace, debug, info, warn, error, or off. (LOG-5372)
* This enhancement adds validation to reject configurations where Amazon CloudWatch outputs use multiple AWS roles, preventing incorrect log routing. (LOG-5640)
* This enhancement removes the Log Bytes Collected and Log Bytes Sent graphs from the metrics dashboard. (LOG-5964)
* This enhancement updates the must-gather functionality to only capture information for inspecting Logging 6.0 components, including Vector deployments from ClusterLogForwarder.observability.openshift.io resources and the Red Hat managed LokiStack. (LOG-5949)
* This enhancement improves Azure storage secret validation by providing early warnings for specific error conditions. (LOG-4571)

# Technology Preview features

* This release introduces a Technology Preview feature for log forwarding using OpenTelemetry. A new output type,` OTLP`, allows sending JSON-encoded log records using the OpenTelemetry data model and resource semantic conventions. (LOG-4225)

# Bug fixes

* Before this update, the CollectorHighErrorRate and CollectorVeryHighErrorRate alerts were still present. With this update, both alerts are removed in the logging 6.0 release but might return in a future release. (LOG-3432)
