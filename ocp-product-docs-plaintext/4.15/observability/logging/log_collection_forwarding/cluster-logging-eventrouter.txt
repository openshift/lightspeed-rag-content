Collecting and storing Kubernetes events

The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Event Router is a pod that watches Kubernetes events and logs them for collection by the logging subsystem. You must manually deploy the Event Router.

The Event Router collects events from all projects and writes them to STDOUT. The collector then forwards those events to the store defined in the ClusterLogForwarder custom resource (CR).

The Event Router adds additional load to Fluentd and can impact the number of other log messages that can be processed.
Deploying and configuring the Event Router
Use the following steps to deploy the Event Router into your cluster. You should always deploy the Event Router to the openshift-logging project to ensure it collects events from across the cluster.

The Event Router image is not a part of the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator and must be downloaded separately.
The following Template object creates the service account, cluster role, and cluster role binding required for the Event Router. The template also configures and deploys the Event Router pod. You can either use this template without making changes or edit the template to change the deployment object CPU and memory requests.

You need proper permissions to create service accounts and update cluster role bindings. For example, you can run the following template with a user that has the cluster-admin role.

The Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator must be installed.


Create a template for the Event Router:

Use the following command to process and apply the template:
