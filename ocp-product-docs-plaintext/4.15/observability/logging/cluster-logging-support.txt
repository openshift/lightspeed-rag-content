Support

Only the configuration options described in this documentation are supported for logging subsystem.

Do not use any other configuration options, as they are unsupported. Configuration paradigms might change across Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform releases, and such cases can only be handled gracefully if all configuration possibilities are controlled. If you use configurations other than those described in this documentation, your changes will be overwritten, because Operators are designed to reconcile any differences.

If you must perform configurations not described in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform documentation, you must set your Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator to Unmanaged. An unmanaged logging subsystem instance is not supported and does not receive updates until you return its status to Managed.
Logging is provided as an installable component, with a distinct release cycle from the core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy outlines release compatibility.
Logging subsystem for Red Hat OpenShift is an opinionated collector and normalizer of application, infrastructure, and audit logs. It is intended to be used for forwarding logs to various supported systems.

Logging subsystem is not:

A high scale log collection system

Security Information and Event Monitoring (SIEM) compliant

Historical or long term log retention or storage

A guaranteed log sink

Secure storage - audit logs are not stored by default
Supported API custom resource definitions
LokiStack development is ongoing. Not all APIs are currently supported.
Unsupported configurations
You must set the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator to the Unmanaged state to modify the following components:

The Elasticsearch custom resource (CR)

The Kibana deployment

The fluent.conf file

The Fluentd daemon set


You must set the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator to the Unmanaged state to modify the Elasticsearch deployment files.

Explicitly unsupported cases include:

Configuring default log rotation. You cannot modify the default log rotation configuration.

Configuring the collected log location. You cannot change the location of the log collector output file, which by default is /var/log/fluentd/fluentd.log.

Throttling log collection. You cannot throttle down the rate at which the logs are read in by the log collector.

Configuring the logging collector using environment variables. You cannot use environment variables to modify the log collector.

Configuring how the log collector normalizes logs. You cannot modify default log normalization.
Support policy for unmanaged Operators
The management state of an Operator determines whether an Operator is actively managing the resources for its related component in the cluster as designed. If an Operator is set to an unmanaged state, it does not respond to changes in configuration nor does it receive updates.

While this can be helpful in non-production clusters or during debugging, Operators in an unmanaged state are unsupported and the cluster administrator assumes full control of the individual component configurations and upgrades.

An Operator can be set to an unmanaged state using the following methods:

Individual Operator configuration

Cluster Version Operator (CVO) overrides
Collecting logging data for Red Hat Support
When opening a support case, it is helpful to provide debugging information about your cluster to Red Hat Support.

You can use the must-gather tool to collect diagnostic information for project-level resources, cluster-level resources, and each of the logging subsystem components.

For prompt support, supply diagnostic information for both Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and logging subsystem.

Do not use the hack/logging-dump.sh script. The script is no longer supported and does not collect data.
About the must-gather tool
The oc adm must-gather CLI command collects the information from your cluster that is most likely needed for debugging issues.

For your logging subsystem, must-gather collects the following information:

Project-level resources, including pods, configuration maps, service accounts, roles, role bindings, and events at the project level

Cluster-level resources, including nodes, roles, and role bindings at the cluster level

OpenShift Logging resources in the openshift-logging and openshift-operators-redhat namespaces, including health status for the log collector, the log store, and the log visualizer


When you run oc adm must-gather, a new pod is created on the cluster. The data is collected on that pod and saved in a new directory that starts with must-gather.local. This directory is created in the current working directory.
Collecting logging subsystem data
You can use the oc adm must-gather CLI command to collect information about logging subsystem.

To collect logging subsystem information with must-gather:

Navigate to the directory where you want to store the must-gather information.

Run the oc adm must-gather command against the logging subsystem image:

Create a compressed file from the must-gather directory that was just created. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

Attach the compressed file to your support case on the Red Hat Customer Portal.
