Log visualization with the web console

You can use the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console to visualize log data by configuring the logging Console Plugin.

For information about configuring the plugin during the logging subsystem installation, see Installing the logging subsystem using the web console.

If you have already installed the logging subsystem and want to configure the plugin, use one of the following procedures.
Enabling the logging Console Plugin after you have installed the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator
You can enable the logging Console Plugin as part of the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator installation, but you can also enable the plugin if you have already installed the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator with the plugin disabled.

You have administrator permissions.

You have installed the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator and selected Disabled for the Console plugin.

You have access to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.


In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console Administrator perspective, navigate to Operators -> Installed Operators.

Click Red Hat OpenShift Logging. This takes you to the Operator Details page.

In the Details page, click Disabled for the Console plugin option.

In logging subsystem version 5.8 and later, if the Elasticsearch log store is your default log store but you have also installed the LokiStack, you can enable the logging Console Plugin by using the following procedure.

You have administrator permissions.

You have installed the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator, the Elasticsearch Operator, and the Loki Operator.

You have created a ClusterLogging custom resource (CR).


Ensure that the logging Console Plugin is enabled by running the following command:

Add the .metadata.annotations.logging.openshift.io/ocp-console-migration-target: lokistack-dev annotation to the ClusterLogging CR, by running the following command:
