About log visualization

You can visualize your log data in the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" web console, or the Kibana web console, depending on your deployed log storage solution. The Kibana console can be used with ElasticSearch log stores, and the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" web console can be used with the ElasticSearch log store or the LokiStack.

The Kibana web console is now deprecated is planned to be removed in a future logging release.

Viewing logs for a resource
Resource logs are a default feature that provides limited log viewing capability. You can view the logs for various resources, such as builds, deployments, and pods by using the OpenShift CLI (oc) and the web console.

To enhance your log retrieving and viewing experience, install the logging. The logging aggregates all the logs from your "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster, such as node system audit logs, application container logs, and infrastructure logs, into a dedicated log store. You can then query, discover, and visualize your log data through the Kibana console or the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" web console. Resource logs do not access the logging log store.
Viewing resource logs
You can view the log for various resources in the OpenShift CLI (oc) and web console. Logs read from the tail, or end, of the log.
