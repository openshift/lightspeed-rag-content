About log visualization

You can visualize your log data in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, or the Kibana web console, depending on your deployed log storage solution. The Kibana console can be used with ElasticSearch log stores, and the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console can be used with the ElasticSearch log store or the LokiStack.

The Kibana web console is now deprecated is planned to be removed in a future logging release.
Configuring the log visualizer
You can configure which log visualizer type your logging subsystem uses by modifying the ClusterLogging custom resource (CR).

You have administrator permissions.

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

You have installed the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator.

You have created a ClusterLogging CR.


If you want to use the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console for visualization, you must enable the logging Console Plugin. See the documentation about "Log visualization with the web console".
Modify the ClusterLogging CR visualization spec:

Apply the ClusterLogging CR by running the following command:
Viewing logs for a resource
Resource logs are a default feature that provides limited log viewing capability. You can view the logs for various resources, such as builds, deployments, and pods by using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) and the web console.

To enhance your log retrieving and viewing experience, install the logging subsystem. The logging subsystem aggregates all the logs from your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, such as node system audit logs, application container logs, and infrastructure logs, into a dedicated log store. You can then query, discover, and visualize your log data through the Kibana console or the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console. Resource logs do not access the logging subsystem log store.
Viewing resource logs
You can view the log for various resources in the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) and web console. Logs read from the tail, or end, of the log.

Access to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).


In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform console, navigate to Workloads -> Pods or navigate to the pod through the resource you want to investigate.

Select a project from the drop-down menu.

Click the name of the pod you want to investigate.
