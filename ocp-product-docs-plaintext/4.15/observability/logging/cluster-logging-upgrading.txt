Updating Logging

There are two types of logging subsystem updates: minor release updates (5.y.z) and major release updates (5.y).
Minor release updates
If you installed the logging subsystem Operators using the Automatic update approval option, your Operators receive minor version updates automatically. You do not need to complete any manual update steps.

If you installed the logging subsystem Operators using the Manual update approval option, you must manually approve minor version updates. For more information, see Manually approving a pending Operator update.
Major release updates
For major version updates you must complete some manual steps.

For major release version compatibility and support information, see OpenShift Operator Life Cycles.
Upgrading the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator to watch all namespaces
In logging 5.7 and older versions, the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator only watches the openshift-logging namespace. If you want the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator to watch all namespaces on your cluster, you must redeploy the Operator. You can complete the following procedure to redeploy the Operator without deleting your logging components.

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

You have administrator permissions.


Delete the subscription by running the following command:

Delete the Operator group by running the following command:

Delete the cluster service version (CSV) by running the following command:

Redeploy the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator by following the "Installing Logging" documentation.


Check that the targetNamespaces field in the OperatorGroup resource is not present or is set to an empty string.
Updating the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator
To update the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator to a new major release version, you must modify the update channel for the Operator subscription.

You have installed the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator.

You have administrator permissions.

You have access to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console and are viewing the Administrator perspective.


Navigate to Operators -> Installed Operators.

Select the openshift-logging project.

Click the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator.

Click Subscription. In the Subscription details section, click the Update channel link. This link text might be stable or stable-5.y, depending on your current update channel.

In the Change Subscription Update Channel window, select the latest major version update channel, stable-5.y, and click Save. Note the cluster-logging.v5.y.z version.


Wait for a few seconds, then click Operators -> Installed Operators. Verify that the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator version matches the latest cluster-logging.v5.y.z version.

On the Operators -> Installed Operators page, wait for the Status field to report Succeeded.
Updating the Loki Operator
To update the Loki Operator to a new major release version, you must modify the update channel for the Operator subscription.

You have installed the Loki Operator.

You have administrator permissions.

You have access to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console and are viewing the Administrator perspective.


Navigate to Operators -> Installed Operators.

Select the openshift-operators-redhat project.

Click the Loki Operator.

Click Subscription. In the Subscription details section, click the Update channel link. This link text might be stable or stable-5.y, depending on your current update channel.

In the Change Subscription Update Channel window, select the latest major version update channel, stable-5.y, and click Save. Note the loki-operator.v5.y.z version.


Wait for a few seconds, then click Operators -> Installed Operators. Verify that the Loki Operator version matches the latest loki-operator.v5.y.z version.

On the Operators -> Installed Operators page, wait for the Status field to report Succeeded.
Updating the Elasticsearch Operator
To update the Elasticsearch Operator to the current version, you must modify the subscription.

The Logging subsystem 5.9 release does not contain an updated version of the Elasticsearch Operator. If you currently use the Elasticsearch Operator released with Logging subsystem 5.8, it will continue to work with Logging subsystem until the EOL of Logging subsystem 5.8. As an alternative to using the Elasticsearch Operator to manage the default log storage, you can use the Loki Operator. For more information on the Logging subsystem lifecycle dates, see Platform Agnostic Operators.
If you are using Elasticsearch as the default log store, and Kibana as the UI, update the Elasticsearch Operator before you update the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator.

The Logging status is healthy:

Your Elasticsearch and Kibana data is backed up.

You have administrator permissions.

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) for the verification steps.


In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, click Operators -> Installed Operators.

Select the openshift-operators-redhat project.

Click OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator.

Click Subscription -> Channel.

In the Change Subscription Update Channel window, select stable-5.y and click Save. Note the elasticsearch-operator.v5.y.z version.

Wait for a few seconds, then click Operators -> Installed Operators. Verify that the Elasticsearch Operator version matches the latest elasticsearch-operator.v5.y.z version.

On the Operators -> Installed Operators page, wait for the Status field to report Succeeded.
