Troubleshooting log forwarding

Redeploying Fluentd pods
When you create a ClusterLogForwarder custom resource (CR), if the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator does not redeploy the Fluentd pods automatically, you can delete the Fluentd pods to force them to redeploy.

You have created a ClusterLogForwarder custom resource (CR) object.


Delete the Fluentd pods to force them to redeploy by running the following command:
Troubleshooting Loki rate limit errors
If the Log Forwarder API forwards a large block of messages that exceeds the rate limit to Loki, Loki generates rate limit (429) errors.

These errors can occur during normal operation. For example, when adding the logging to a cluster that already has some logs, rate limit errors might occur while the logging tries to ingest all of the existing log entries. In this case, if the rate of addition of new logs is less than the total rate limit, the historical data is eventually ingested, and the rate limit errors are resolved without requiring user intervention.

In cases where the rate limit errors continue to occur, you can fix the issue by modifying the LokiStack custom resource (CR).

The LokiStack CR is not available on Grafana-hosted Loki. This topic does not apply to Grafana-hosted Loki servers.
The Log Forwarder API is configured to forward logs to Loki.

Your system sends a block of messages that is larger than 2 MB to Loki. For example:

After you enter oc logs -n openshift-logging -l component=collector, the collector logs in your cluster show a line containing one of the following error messages:
