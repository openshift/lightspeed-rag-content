# Filtering logs by metadata


You can filter logs in the ClusterLogForwarder CR to select or ignore an entire log stream based on the metadata by using the input selector. As an administrator or developer, you can include or exclude the log collection to reduce the memory and CPU load on the collector.

[IMPORTANT]
----
You can use this feature only if the Vector collector is set up in your logging deployment.
----

[NOTE]
----
input spec filtering is different from content filtering. input selectors select or ignore entire log streams based on the source metadata. Content filters edit the log streams to remove and modify the records based on the record content.

# Filtering application logs at input by including or excluding the namespace or container name

You can include or exclude the application logs based on the namespace and container name by using the input selector.

* You have installed the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator.
* You have administrator permissions.
* You have created a ClusterLogForwarder custom resource (CR).

1. Add a configuration to include or exclude the namespace and container names in the ClusterLogForwarder CR.

The following example shows how to configure the ClusterLogForwarder CR to include or exclude namespaces and container names:
Example ClusterLogForwarder CR

```yaml
apiVersion: "logging.openshift.io/v1"
kind: ClusterLogForwarder
# ...
spec:
  inputs:
    - name: mylogs
      application:
        includes:
          - namespace: "my-project" 1
            container: "my-container" 2
        excludes:
          - container: "other-container*" 3
            namespace: "other-namespace" 4
# ...
```

Specifies that the logs are only collected from these namespaces.
Specifies that the logs are only collected from these containers.
Specifies the pattern of namespaces to ignore when collecting the logs.
Specifies the set of containers to ignore when collecting the logs.
2. Apply the ClusterLogForwarder CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
```


The excludes option takes precedence over includes.

# Filtering application logs at input by including either the label expressions or matching label key and values

You can include the application logs based on the label expressions or a matching label key and its values by using the input selector.

* You have installed the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator.
* You have administrator permissions.
* You have created a ClusterLogForwarder custom resource (CR).

1. Add a configuration for a filter to the input spec in the ClusterLogForwarder CR.

The following example shows how to configure the ClusterLogForwarder CR to include logs based on label expressions or matched label key/values:
Example ClusterLogForwarder CR

```yaml
apiVersion: "logging.openshift.io/v1"
kind: ClusterLogForwarder
# ...
spec:
  inputs:
    - name: mylogs
      application:
        selector:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: env 1
            operator: In 2
            values: [“prod”, “qa”] 3
          - key: zone
            operator: NotIn
            values: [“east”, “west”]
          matchLabels: 4
            app: one
            name: app1
# ...
```

Specifies the label key to match.
Specifies the operator. Valid values include: In, NotIn, Exists, and DoesNotExist.
Specifies an array of string values. If the operator value is either Exists or DoesNotExist, the value array must be empty.
Specifies an exact key or value mapping.
2. Apply the ClusterLogForwarder CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
```


# Filtering the audit and infrastructure log inputs by source

You can define the list of audit and infrastructure sources to collect the logs by using the input selector.

* You have installed the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator.
* You have administrator permissions.
* You have created a ClusterLogForwarder custom resource (CR).

1. Add a configuration to define the audit and infrastructure sources in the ClusterLogForwarder CR.

The following example shows how to configure the ClusterLogForwarder CR to define aduit and infrastructure sources:
Example ClusterLogForwarder CR

```yaml
apiVersion: "logging.openshift.io/v1"
kind: ClusterLogForwarder
# ...
spec:
  inputs:
    - name: mylogs1
      infrastructure:
        sources: 1
          - node
    - name: mylogs2
      audit:
        sources: 2
          - kubeAPI
          - openshiftAPI
          - ovn
# ...
```

Specifies the list of infrastructure sources to collect. The valid sources include:
* node: Journal log from the node
* container: Logs from the workloads deployed in the namespaces
Specifies the list of audit sources to collect. The valid sources include:
* kubeAPI: Logs from the Kubernetes API servers
* openshiftAPI: Logs from the OpenShift API servers
* auditd: Logs from a node auditd service
* ovn: Logs from an open virtual network service
2. Apply the ClusterLogForwarder CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
```
