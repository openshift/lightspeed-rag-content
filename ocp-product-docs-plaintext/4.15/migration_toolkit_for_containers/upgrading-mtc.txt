Upgrading the Migration Toolkit for Containers on "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" {product-version}
You can upgrade the Migration Toolkit for Containers (MTC) on "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" {product-version} by using the Operator Lifecycle Manager.

When upgrading the MTC by using the Operator Lifecycle Manager, you must use a supported migration path.
Migrating from "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" 3 to "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" 4 requires a legacy MTC Operator and MTC 1.7.x.

Migrating from MTC 1.7.x to MTC 1.8.x is not supported.

You must use MTC 1.7.x to migrate anything with a source of "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" 4.9 or earlier.

MTC 1.8.x only supports migrations from "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" 4.10 or later to "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" 4.10 or later. For migrations only involving cluster versions 4.10 and later, either 1.7.x or 1.8.x may be used. However, it must be the same MTC version on both source & destination.

Upgrading MTC 1.3 to 1.8
If you are upgrading Migration Toolkit for Containers (MTC) version 1.3.x to 1.8, you must update the MigPlan custom resource (CR) manifest on the cluster on which the MigrationController pod is running.

Because the indirectImageMigration and indirectVolumeMigration parameters do not exist in MTC 1.3, their default value in version 1.4 is false, which means that direct image migration and direct volume migration are enabled. Because the direct migration requirements are not fulfilled, the migration plan cannot reach a Ready state unless these parameter values are changed to true.
