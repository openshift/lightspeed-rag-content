Premigration checklists

Before you migrate your application workloads with the Migration Toolkit for Containers (MTC), review the following checklists.
Cluster health checklist
The clusters meet the minimum hardware requirements for the specific platform and installation method, for example, on bare metal.

All MTC prerequisites are met.

All nodes have an active Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform subscription.

You have verified node health.

The identity provider is working.

The migration network has a minimum throughput of 10 Gbps.

The clusters have sufficient resources for migration.

The etcd disk performance of the clusters has been checked with fio.
Source cluster checklist
You have checked for persistent volumes (PVs) with abnormal configurations  stuck in a Terminating state by running the following command:

You have checked for pods whose status is other than Running or Completed by running the following command:

You have checked for pods with a high restart count by running the following command:

The cluster certificates are valid for the duration of the migration process.

You have checked for pending certificate-signing requests by running the following command:

The registry uses a recommended storage type.

You can read and write images to the registry.

The etcd cluster is healthy.

The average API server response time on the source cluster is less than 50 ms.
Target cluster checklist
The cluster has the correct network configuration and permissions to access external services, for example, databases, source code repositories, container image registries, and CI/CD tools.

External applications and services that use services provided by the cluster have the correct network configuration and permissions to access the cluster.

Internal container image dependencies are met.

The target cluster and the replication repository have sufficient storage space.
