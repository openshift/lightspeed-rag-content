Migration Toolkit for Containers release notes

The release notes for Migration Toolkit for Containers (MTC) describe new features and enhancements, deprecated features, and known issues.

The MTC enables you to migrate application workloads between Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters at the granularity of a namespace.

You can migrate from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3 to 4.15 and between Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 clusters.

MTC provides a web console and an API, based on Kubernetes custom resources, to help you control the migration and minimize application downtime.

For information on the support policy for MTC, see OpenShift Application and Cluster Migration Solutions, part of the Red Hat Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy.
Migration Toolkit for Containers 1.8.3 release notes
Technical changes
Migration Toolkit for Containers (MTC) 1.8.3 has the following technical changes:

MTC 1.8.3 adds support to OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) as a dependency of MTC 1.8.z.
Resolved issues
This release has the following major resolved issues:

In previous releases of MTC, a vulnerability was found in Golang's protobuf module, where the unmarshal function entered an infinite loop while processing certain invalid inputs. Consequently, an attacker provided carefully constructed invalid inputs, which caused the function to enter an infinite loop.

With this update, the unmarshal function works as expected.

For more information, see CVE-2024-24786.

In previous releases of MTC, a vulnerability was discovered in Axios 1.5.1 that inadvertently revealed a confidential XSRF-TOKEN stored in cookies by including it in the HTTP header X-XSRF-TOKEN for every request made to the host, allowing attackers to view sensitive information.

For more information, see CVE-2023-45857.

In previous releases of MTC, some files did not migrate when deploying an application with a route. The Restic backup did not function as expected when the quiesce option was unchecked for the source workload.

This issue has been resolved in MTC 1.8.3.

For more information, see BZ#2242064.

The MigrationController failed to install due to an unsupported value error in Velero. Updating OADP 1.3.0 to OADP 1.3.1 resolves this problem. For more information, see BZ#2267018.

This issue has been resolved in MTC 1.8.3.

For a complete list of all resolved issues, see the list of MTC 1.8.3 resolved issues in Jira.
Known issues
MTC has the following known issues:

The associated Security Context Constraints (SCCs) for service accounts in OpenShift Container Platform version 4.12 cannot be migrated. This issue is planned to be resolved in a future release of MTC. (MIG-1454).

For a complete list of all known issues, see the list of MTC 1.8.3 known issues in Jira.
Migration Toolkit for Containers 1.8.2 release notes
Resolved issues
This release has the following major resolved issues:

In previous releases of Migration Toolkit for Containers (MTC), after editing the replication repository, adding a custom CA certificate, successfully connecting the repository, and triggering a migration, a failure occurred during the backup phase.

In previous releases of (MTC), versions before 4.1.3 of the tough-cookie package used in MTC were vulnerable to prototype pollution. This vulnerability occurred because CookieJar did not handle cookies properly when the value of the rejectPublicSuffixes was set to false.

For more details, see (CVE-2023-26136)

In previous releases of (MTC), versions of the semver package before 7.5.2, used in MTC, were vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) from the function newRange, when untrusted user data was provided as a range.

For more details, see (CVE-2022-25883)
Known issues
There are no major known issues in this release.
Migration Toolkit for Containers 1.8.1 release notes
Resolved issues
This release has the following major resolved issues:

A flaw was found in handling multiplexed streams in the HTTP/2 protocol, which is used by Migration Toolkit for Containers (MTC). A client could repeatedly make a request for a new multiplex stream and immediately send an RST_STREAM frame to cancel it. This creates additional workload for the server in terms of setting up and dismantling streams, while avoiding any server-side limitations on the maximum number of active streams per connection, resulting in a denial of service due to server resource consumption. (BZ#2245079)

It is advised to update to MTC 1.8.1 or later, which resolve this issue.

For more details, see (CVE-2023-39325) and (CVE-2023-44487)
Known issues
There are no major known issues in this release.
Migration Toolkit for Containers 1.8 release notes
Resolved issues
This release has the following resolved issues:

In previous releases, an indirect migration became stuck at the backup stage, due to InvalidImageName error. (BZ#2233097)

In previous releases, on performing an indirect migration, the migration became stuck at the Stage Restore step, waiting for the podvolumerestore to be completed. (BZ#2233868)

In previous releases, on migrating an application to the target cluster, the migrated application failed to pull the image from the internal image registry resulting in an application failure. (BZ#2233103)

In previous releases, on an Azure cluster, when backing up to Azure storage, the migration failed at the Backup stage. (BZ#2238974)
Known issues
This release has the following known issues:

In this release, on upgrading the MTC Operator from 1.7.x to 1.8.x, the old Restic pods are not being removed. Therefore after the upgrade, both Restic and node-agent pods are visible in the namespace. (BZ#2236829)

In this release, on migrating an application including a BuildConfig from a source to target cluster, builder pod results in error, failing to push the image to the image registry. (BZ#2234781)

In this release, after enabling Require SSL verification and adding content to the CA bundle file for an MCG NooBaa bucket in MigStorage, the connection fails as expected. However, when reverting these changes by removing the CA bundle content and clearing Require SSL verification, the connection still fails. The issue is only resolved by deleting and re-adding the repository. (BZ#2240052)

In (MTC), after editing the replication repository, adding a custom CA certificate, successfully connecting the repository, and triggering a migration, a failure occurs during the backup phase.

This issue is resolved in MTC 1.8.2.

Versions before 4.1.3 of the tough-cookie package, used in MTC, are vulnerable to prototype pollution. This vulnerability occurs because CookieJar does not handle cookies properly when the value of the rejectPublicSuffixes is set to false.

This issue is resolved in MTC 1.8.2.

For more details, see (CVE-2023-26136)

In previous releases of (MTC), versions of the semver package before 7.5.2, used in MTC, are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) from the function newRange, when untrusted user data is provided as a range.

This issue is resolved in MTC 1.8.2.

For more details, see (CVE-2022-25883)
Technical changes
This release has the following technical changes:

Migration from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3 to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 requires a legacy Migration Toolkit for Containers (MTC) Operator and MTC 1.7.x.

Migration from MTC 1.7.x to MTC 1.8.x is not supported.

You must use MTC 1.7.x to migrate anything with a source of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.9 or earlier.

MTC 1.8.x only supports migrations from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 or later to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 or later. For migrations only involving cluster versions 4.10 and later, either 1.7.x or 1.8.x might be used. However, but it must be the same MTC 1.Y.z on both source and destination.

MTC 1.8.x by default installs OADP 1.2.x.

Upgrading from MTC 1.7.x to MTC 1.8.0, requires manually changing the OADP channel to 1.2. If this is not done, the upgrade of the Operator fails.
Migration Toolkit for Containers 1.7.15 release notes
Resolved issues
This release has the following resolved issues:

A flaw was found in the protojson.Unmarshal function that could cause the function to enter an infinite loop when unmarshaling certain forms of invalid JSON messages. This condition could occur when unmarshaling into a message that contained a google.protobuf.Any value or when the UnmarshalOptions.DiscardUnknown option was set in a JSON-formatted message.

To resolve this issue, upgrade to MTC 1.7.15.

For more details, see (CVE-2024-24786).

A vulnerability was found in Jose due to improper handling of highly compressed data. An attacker could send a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) encrypted message that contained compressed data that used large amounts of memory and CPU when decompressed by the Decrypt or DecryptMulti functions. 

To resolve this issue, upgrade to MTC 1.7.15.

For more details, see (CVE-2024-28180).
Known issues
This release has the following known issues:

On migrating any application with Persistent Volume Claim (PVC), the Stage migration operation succeeds with warnings, and Direct Volume Migration (DVM) fails with the rsync pod on the source namespace going into an error state. (BZ#2256141)

When creating a new state migration plan that results in a conflict error message, the error message is cleared shortly after it is displayed. (BZ#2144299)

When there are multiple VSLs in a cluster with different provider types, and you set none of them as the default VSL, Velero results in a validation error that causes migration operations to fail. (BZ#2180565)
Migration Toolkit for Containers 1.7.14 release notes
Resolved issues
This release has the following resolved issues:

A flaw was found in the handling of multiplexed streams in the HTTP/2 protocol, which is utilized by Migration Toolkit for Containers (MTC). A client could repeatedly make a request for a new multiplex stream then immediately send an RST_STREAM frame to cancel those requests. This activity created additional workloads for the server in terms of setting up and dismantling streams, but avoided any server-side limitations on the maximum number of active streams per connection. As a result, a denial of service occurred due to server resource consumption.

(BZ#2244017)


To resolve this issue, upgrade to MTC 1.7.14.

For more details, see (CVE-2023-44487) and (CVE-2023-39325).

(CVE-2023-39318): A flaw was discovered in Golang, utilized by MTC. The html/template package did not properly handle HTML-like "" comment tokens, or the hashbang "#!" comment tokens, in <script> contexts. This flaw could cause the template parser to improperly interpret the contents of <script> contexts, causing actions to be improperly escaped.

(CVE-2023-39319): A flaw was discovered in Golang, utilized by MTC. The html/template package did not apply the proper rules for handling occurrences of "<script", "<!--", and "</script" within JavaScript literals in <script> contexts. This could cause the template parser to improperly consider script contexts to be terminated early, causing actions to be improperly escaped. 

(CVE-2023-39321): A flaw was discovered in Golang, utilized by MTC. Processing an incomplete post-handshake message for a QUIC connection could cause a panic.

(CVE-2023-3932): A flaw was discovered in Golang, utilized by MTC. Connections using the QUIC transport protocol did not set an upper bound on the amount of data buffered when reading post-handshake messages, allowing a malicious QUIC connection to cause unbounded memory growth. 


To resolve these issues, upgrade to MTC 1.7.14.

For more details, see (CVE-2023-39318), (CVE-2023-39319), and (CVE-2023-39321).

Migration Toolkit for Containers 1.7.6 release notes
New features
With the incoming enforcement of Pod Security Admission (PSA) in OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 the default pod would run with a restricted profile. This restricted profile would mean workloads to migrate would be in violation of this policy and no longer work as of now. The following enhancement outlines the changes that would be required to remain compatible with OCP 4.12. (MIG-1240)
Resolved issues
This release has the following major resolved issues:

In previous releases, on the persistent volumes page, an error is thrown that a CronJob is not available in version batch/v1beta1, and when clicking on cancel, the migplan is created with status Not ready. (BZ#2143628)

Migration Toolkit for Containers 1.7.2 release notes
Resolved issues
This release has the following major resolved issues:

In previous releases, the MTC UI did not display logs correctly. (BZ#2062266)

In previous releases, StorageClass conversion plans had a migstorage reference even though it was not being used. (BZ#2078459)

In previous releases, when downloading a compressed (.zip) folder for all logs, the velero pod was missing. (BZ#2076599)

In previous releases, after a migration was performed, the velero pod log was not included in the logs provided in the dropdown list. (BZ#2076593)

In previous releases, when trying to set any valid or invalid rsync options in the migrationcontroller, the log-reader was not showing any logs regarding the invalid options or about the rsync command being used. (BZ#2079252)

In previous releases, the default CPU requests on Velero/Restic were too demanding and fail in certain environments. Default CPU requests for Velero and Restic Pods are set to 500m. These values were high. (BZ#2088022)
Known issues
This release has the following known issues:

After updating the replication repository to a different type and clicking Update Repository, it shows connection successful, but the UI is not updated with the correct details. When clicking on the Edit button again, it still shows the old replication repository information.

Furthermore, when trying to update the replication repository again, it still shows the old replication details. When selecting the new repository, it also shows all the information you entered previously and the Update repository is not enabled, as if there are no changes to be submitted. (BZ#2102020)

Migration fails at the restore stage because of initial backup has not been found. (BZ#2104874)

When updating the remote cluster, selecting the Azure resource group checkbox, and adding a resource group does not enable the Update cluster option. (BZ#2098594)

When creating a backupStorage credential secret in OpenShift Container Platform, if the migstorage is removed from the UI, a 404 error is returned and the underlying secret is not removed. (BZ#2100828)

After creating a migplan from backend, the Miganalytic resource displays the resource count as 0 in UI. (BZ#2102139)

After adding two trailing slashes, meaning //, to the exposed registry route, the MigCluster resource is showing the status as connected. When creating a migplan from backend with DIM, the plans move to the unready status. (BZ#2104864)

When editing the source cluster that has been added and is in Connected state, in the UI, the service account token is not visible in the field. To save the wizard, you have to fetch the token again and provide details inside the field. (BZ#2097668)
Migration Toolkit for Containers 1.7.1 release notes
Resolved issues
There are no major resolved issues in this release.
Known issues
This release has the following known issues:

MigPlan cannot be validated because the destination namespace starts with a non-alphabetic character. (BZ#2102231)

The Cloud propagation phase in the migration controller is not functioning due to missing labels on Velero pods. The EnsureCloudSecretPropagated phase in the migration controller waits until replication repository secrets are propagated on both sides. As this label is missing on Velero pods, the phase is not functioning as expected. (BZ#2088026)

Default CPU requests on Velero/Restic are too demanding when making scheduling fail in certain environments. Default CPU requests for Velero and Restic Pods are set to 500m. These values are high. The resources can be configured in DPA using the podConfig field for Velero and Restic. Migration operator should set CPU requests to a lower value, such as 100m, so that Velero and Restic pods can be scheduled in resource constrained environments MTC often operates in. (BZ#2088022)

A warning is displayed on the persistentVolumes page after editing the storage class conversion plan. When editing the existing migration plan, a warning is displayed on the UI At least one PVC must be selected for Storage Class Conversion. (BZ#2079549)

When downloading a compressed (.zip) folder for all logs, the velero pod is missing. (BZ#2076599)

After a migration is performed, the velero pod log is not included in the logs provided in the dropdown list. (BZ#2076593)
Migration Toolkit for Containers 1.7 release notes
New features and enhancements
This release has the following new features and enhancements:

The Migration Toolkit for Containers (MTC) Operator now depends upon the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Operator. When you install the MTC Operator, the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically installs the OADP Operator in the same namespace.

You can migrate from a source cluster that is behind a firewall to a cloud-based destination cluster by establishing a network tunnel between the two clusters by using the crane tunnel-api command.

Converting storage classes in the MTC web console: You can convert the storage class of a persistent volume (PV) by migrating it within the same cluster.
Known issues
This release has the following known issues:

MigPlan custom resource does not display a warning when an AWS gp2 PVC has no available space. (BZ#1963927)

Direct and indirect data transfers do not work if the destination storage is a PV that is dynamically provisioned by the AWS Elastic File System (EFS). This is due to limitations of the AWS EFS Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver. (BZ#2085097)

Block storage for IBM Cloud must be in the same availability zone. See the IBM FAQ for block storage for virtual private cloud.

MTC 1.7.6 cannot migrate cron jobs from source clusters that support v1beta1 cron jobs to clusters of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 and later, which do not support v1beta1 cron jobs. (BZ#2149119)
Migration Toolkit for Containers 1.6 release notes
New features and enhancements
This release has the following new features and enhancements:

State migration: You can perform repeatable, state-only migrations by selecting specific persistent volume claims (PVCs).

"New operator version available" notification: The Clusters page of the MTC web console displays a notification when a new Migration Toolkit for Containers Operator is available.
Deprecated features
The following features are deprecated:

MTC version 1.4 is no longer supported.
Known issues
This release has the following known issues:

On Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.10, the MigrationController pod takes too long to restart. The Bugzilla report contains a workaround. (BZ#1986796)

Stage pods fail during direct volume migration from a classic Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform source cluster on IBM Cloud. The IBM block storage plugin does not allow the same volume to be mounted on multiple pods of the same node. As a result, the PVCs cannot be mounted on the Rsync pods and on the application pods simultaneously. To resolve this issue, stop the application pods before migration. (BZ#1887526)

MigPlan custom resource does not display a warning when an AWS gp2 PVC has no available space. (BZ#1963927)

Block storage for IBM Cloud must be in the same availability zone. See the IBM FAQ for block storage for virtual private cloud.
Migration Toolkit for Containers 1.5 release notes
New features and enhancements
This release has the following new features and enhancements:

The Migration resource tree on the Migration details page of the web console has been enhanced with additional resources, Kubernetes events, and live status information for monitoring and debugging migrations.

The web console can support hundreds of migration plans.

A source namespace can be mapped to a different target namespace in a migration plan. Previously, the source namespace was mapped to a target namespace with the same name.

Hook phases with status information are displayed in the web console during a migration.

The number of Rsync retry attempts is displayed in the web console during direct volume migration.

Persistent volume (PV) resizing can be enabled for direct volume migration to ensure that the target cluster does not run out of disk space.

The threshold that triggers PV resizing is configurable. Previously, PV resizing occurred when the disk usage exceeded 97%.

Velero has been updated to version 1.6, which provides numerous fixes and enhancements.

Cached Kubernetes clients can be enabled to provide improved performance.
Deprecated features
The following features are deprecated:

MTC versions 1.2 and 1.3 are no longer supported.

The procedure for updating deprecated APIs has been removed from the troubleshooting section of the documentation because the oc convert command is deprecated.
Known issues
This release has the following known issues:

Microsoft Azure storage is unavailable if you create more than 400 migration plans. The MigStorage custom resource displays the following message: The request is being throttled as the limit has been reached for operation type. (BZ#1977226)

If a migration fails, the migration plan does not retain custom persistent volume (PV) settings for quiesced pods. You must manually roll back the migration, delete the migration plan, and create a new migration plan with your PV settings. (BZ#1784899)

PV resizing does not work as expected for AWS gp2 storage unless the pv_resizing_threshold is 42% or greater. (BZ#1973148)

PV resizing does not work with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.7 and 3.9 source clusters in the following scenarios:
Technical changes
This release has the following technical changes:

The legacy Migration Toolkit for Containers Operator version 1.5.1 is installed manually on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform versions 3.7 to 4.5.

The Migration Toolkit for Containers Operator version 1.5.1 is installed on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform versions 4.6 and later by using the Operator Lifecycle Manager.
