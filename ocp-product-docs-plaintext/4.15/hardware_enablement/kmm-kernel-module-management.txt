Kernel Module Management Operator

Learn about the Kernel Module Management (KMM) Operator and how you can use it to deploy out-of-tree kernel modules and device plugins on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters.
About the Kernel Module Management Operator
The Kernel Module Management (KMM) Operator manages, builds, signs, and deploys out-of-tree kernel modules and device plugins on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters.

KMM adds a new Module CRD which describes an out-of-tree kernel module and its associated device plugin. You can use Module resources to configure how to load the module, define ModuleLoader images for kernel versions, and include instructions for building and signing modules for specific kernel versions.

KMM is designed to accommodate multiple kernel versions at once for any kernel module, allowing for seamless node upgrades and reduced application downtime.
Installing the Kernel Module Management Operator
As a cluster administrator, you can install the Kernel Module Management (KMM) Operator by using the OpenShift CLI or the web console.

The KMM Operator is supported on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 and later. Installing KMM on version 4.11 does not require specific additional steps. For details on installing KMM on version 4.10 and earlier, see the section "Installing the Kernel Module Management Operator on earlier versions of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform".

Configuring the Kernel Module Management Operator
In most cases, the default configuration for the Kernel Module Management (KMM) Operator does not need to be modified. However, you can modify the Operator settings to suit your environment using the following procedure.

The Operator configuration is set in the kmm-operator-manager-config ConfigMap in the Operator namespace.

To modify the settings, edit the ConfigMap data by entering the following command:

After modifying the settings, restart the controller with the following command:


For more information, see Installing the Kernel Module Management Operator.


Unloading the kernel module
You must unload the kernel modules when moving to a newer version or if they introduce some undesirable side effect on the node.

To unload a module loaded with KMM from nodes, delete the corresponding Module resource. KMM then creates worker pods, where required, to run modprobe -r and unload the kernel module from the nodes.
Setting the kernel firmware search path
The Linux kernel accepts the firmware_class.path parameter as a search path for firmware, as explained in Firmware search paths.

KMM worker pods can set this value on nodes by writing to sysfs before attempting to load kmods.

To define a firmware search path, set worker.setFirmwareClassPath to /var/lib/firmware in the Operator configuration.


For more information about the worker.setFirmwareClassPath path, see Configuring the Kernel Module Management Operator.
Uninstalling the Kernel Module Management Operator
Use one of the following procedures to uninstall the Kernel Module Management (KMM) Operator, depending on how the KMM Operator was installed.

Uninstalling a Red Hat catalog installation
Use this procedure if KMM was installed from the Red Hat catalog.

Use the following method to uninstall the KMM Operator:

Use the OpenShift console under Operators --> Installed Operators to locate and uninstall the Operator.


Alternatively, you can delete the Subscription resource in the KMM namespace.
Uninstalling a CLI installation
Use this command if the KMM Operator was installed using the OpenShift CLI.

Run the following command to uninstall the KMM Operator:
Kernel module deployment
Kernel Module Management (KMM) monitors Node and Module resources in the cluster to determine if a kernel module should be loaded on or unloaded from a node.

To be eligible for a module, a node must contain the following:

Labels that match the module's .spec.selector field.

A kernel version matching one of the items in the module's .spec.moduleLoader.container.kernelMappings field.

If ordered upgrade (ordered_upgrade.md) is configured in the module, a label that matches its .spec.moduleLoader.container.version field.


When KMM reconciles nodes with the desired state as configured in the Module resource, it creates worker pods on the target nodes to run the necessary action. The KMM Operator monitors the outcome of the pods and records the information. The Operator uses this information to label the Node objects when the module is successfully loaded, and to run the device plugin, if configured.

Worker pods run the KMM worker binary that performs the following tasks:

Pulls the kmod image configured in the Module resource. Kmod images are standard OCI images that  contain .ko files.

Extracts the image in the pod's filesystem.

Runs modprobe with the specified arguments to perform the necessary action.


The Module custom resource definition
The Module custom resource definition (CRD) represents a kernel module that can be loaded on all or select nodes in the cluster, through a kmod image. A Module custom resource (CR) specifies one or more kernel versions with which it is compatible, and a node selector.

The compatible versions for a Module resource are listed under .spec.moduleLoader.container.kernelMappings. A kernel mapping can either match a literal version, or use regexp to match many of them at the same time.

The reconciliation loop for the Module resource runs the following steps:

List all nodes matching .spec.selector.

Build a set of all kernel versions running on those nodes.

For each kernel version:

Run garbage-collect on:
Set soft dependencies between kernel modules
Some configurations require that several kernel modules be loaded in a specific order to work properly, even though the modules do not directly depend on each other through symbols. These are called soft dependencies. depmod is usually not aware of these dependencies, and they do not appear in the files it produces. For example, if mod_a has a soft dependency on mod_b, modprobe mod_a will not load mod_b.

You can resolve these situations by declaring soft dependencies in the Module custom resource definition (CRD) using the modulesLoadingOrder field.

# ...
spec:
  moduleLoader:
    container:
      modprobe:
        moduleName: mod_a
        dirName: /opt
        firmwarePath: /firmware
        parameters:
          - param=1
        modulesLoadingOrder:
          - mod_a
          - mod_b
In the configuration above, the worker pod will first try to unload the in-tree mod_b before loading mod_a from the kmod image. When the worker pod is terminated and mod_a is unloaded, mod_b will not be loaded again.

The first value in the list, to be loaded last, must be equivalent to the moduleName.
Security and permissions
Loading kernel modules is a highly sensitive operation. After they are loaded, kernel modules have all possible permissions to do any kind of operation on the node.
ServiceAccounts and SecurityContextConstraints
Kernel Module Management (KMM) creates a privileged workload to load the kernel modules on nodes. That workload needs ServiceAccounts allowed to use the privileged SecurityContextConstraint (SCC) resource.

The authorization model for that workload depends on the namespace of the Module resource, as well as its spec.

If the .spec.moduleLoader.serviceAccountName or .spec.devicePlugin.serviceAccountName fields are set, they are always used.

If those fields are not set, then:


openshift-kmm is a trusted namespace.

When setting up RBAC permissions, remember that any user or ServiceAccount creating a Module resource in the openshift-kmm namespace results in KMM automatically running privileged workloads on potentially all nodes in the cluster.
To allow any ServiceAccount to use the privileged SCC and run worker or device plugin pods, you can use the oc adm policy command, as in the following example:

$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z "${serviceAccountName}" [ -n "${namespace}" ]
Pod security standards
OpenShift runs a synchronization mechanism that sets the namespace Pod Security level automatically based on the security contexts in use. No action is needed.

Understanding and managing pod security admission
Replacing in-tree modules with out-of-tree modules
You can use Kernel Module Management (KMM) to build kernel modules that can be loaded or unloaded into the kernel on demand. These modules extend the functionality of the kernel without the need to reboot the system. Modules can be configured as built-in or dynamically loaded.

Dynamically loaded modules include in-tree modules and out-of-tree (OOT) modules. In-tree modules are internal to the Linux kernel tree, that is, they are already part of the kernel. Out-of-tree modules are external to the Linux kernel tree. They are generally written for development and testing purposes, such as testing the new version of a kernel module that is shipped in-tree, or to deal with incompatibilities.

Some modules loaded by KMM could replace in-tree modules already loaded on the node. To unload an in-tree module before loading your module, set the .spec.moduleLoader.container.inTreeModuleToRemove field. The following is an example for module replacement for all kernel mappings:

# ...
spec:
  moduleLoader:
    container:
      modprobe:
        moduleName: mod_a

      inTreeModuleToRemove: mod_b
In this example, the moduleLoader pod uses inTreeModuleToRemove to unload the in-tree mod_b before loading mod_a from the moduleLoader image. When the moduleLoader`pod is terminated and `mod_a is unloaded, mod_b is not loaded again.

The following is an example for module replacement for specific kernel mappings:

# ...
spec:
  moduleLoader:
    container:
      kernelMappings:
        - literal: 6.0.15-300.fc37.x86_64
          containerImage: some.registry/org/my-kmod:6.0.15-300.fc37.x86_64

Creating a kmod image
Kernel Module Management (KMM) works with purpose-built kmod images, which are standard OCI images that contain .ko files. The location of the .ko files must match the following pattern: <prefix>/lib/modules/[kernel-version]/.

Keep the following in mind when working with the .ko files:

In most cases, <prefix> should be equal to /opt. This is the Module CRD's default value.

kernel-version must not be empty and must be equal to the kernel version the kernel modules were built for.


Running depmod
It is recommended to run depmod at the end of the build process to generate modules.dep and .map files. This is especially useful if your kmod image contains several kernel modules and if one of the modules depends on another module.

You must have a Red Hat subscription to download the kernel-devel package.
Generate modules.dep and .map files for a specific kernel version by running the following command:


Example Dockerfile
If you are building your image on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, consider using the Driver Tool Kit (DTK).

For further information, see using an entitled build.

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: kmm-ci-dockerfile

    RUN depmod -b /opt ${KERNEL_VERSION}
Driver Toolkit
Building in the cluster
KMM can build kmod images in the cluster. Follow these guidelines:

Provide build instructions using the build section of a kernel mapping.

Copy the Dockerfile for your container image into a ConfigMap resource, under the dockerfile key.

Ensure that the ConfigMap is located in the same namespace as the Module.


KMM checks if the image name specified in the containerImage field exists. If it does, the build is skipped.

Otherwise, KMM creates a Build resource to build your image. After the image is built, KMM proceeds with the Module reconciliation. See the following example.

# ...
- regexp: '^.+$'
  containerImage: "some.registry/org/<my_kmod>:${KERNEL_FULL_VERSION}"
  build:
    buildArgs:  1
      - name: ARG_NAME

Build configuration resources

Preflight validation for Kernel Module Management (KMM) Modules
Using the Driver Toolkit
The Driver Toolkit (DTK) is a convenient base image for building build kmod loader images. It contains tools and libraries for the OpenShift version currently running in the cluster.

Use DTK as the first stage of a multi-stage Dockerfile.

Build the kernel modules.

Copy the .ko files into a smaller end-user image such as ubi-minimal.

To leverage DTK in your in-cluster build, use the DTK_AUTO build argument.
The value is automatically set by KMM when creating the Build resource. See the following example.


Driver Toolkit
Using signing with Kernel Module Management (KMM)
On a Secure Boot enabled system, all kernel modules (kmods) must be signed with a public/private key-pair enrolled into the Machine Owner's Key (MOK) database. Drivers distributed as part of a distribution should already be signed by the distribution's private key, but for kernel modules build out-of-tree, KMM supports signing kernel modules using the sign section of the kernel mapping.

For more details on using Secure Boot, see Generating a public and private key pair

A public private key pair in the correct (DER) format.

At least one secure-boot enabled node with the public key enrolled in its MOK database.

Either a pre-built driver container image, or the source code and Dockerfile needed to build one in-cluster.
Adding the keys for secureboot
To use KMM Kernel Module Management (KMM) to sign kernel modules, a certificate and private key are required. For details on how to create these, see Generating a public and private key pair.

For details on how to extract the public and private key pair, see Signing kernel modules with the private key. Use steps 1 through 4 to extract the keys into files.

Create the sb_cert.cer file that contains the certificate and the sb_cert.priv file that contains the private key:

Add the files by using one of the following methods:

Add the encoded text to a YAML file:

Apply the YAML file:


Checking the keys
After you have added the keys, you must check them to ensure they are set correctly.

Check to ensure the public key secret is set correctly:

Check to ensure the private key secret is set correctly:
Signing kmods in a pre-built image
Use this procedure if you have a pre-built image, such as an image either distributed by a hardware vendor or built elsewhere.

The following YAML file adds the public/private key-pair as secrets with the required key names - key for the private key, cert for the public key. The cluster then pulls down the unsignedImage image, opens it, signs the kernel modules listed in filesToSign, adds them back, and pushes the resulting image as containerImage.

KMM then loads the signed kmods onto all the nodes with that match the selector. The kmods are successfully loaded on any nodes that have the public key in their MOK database, and any nodes that are not secure-boot enabled, which will ignore the signature.

The keySecret and certSecret secrets have been created in the same namespace as the rest of the resources.


Apply the YAML file:


The name of the kmod to load.

The name of the container image. For example, quay.io/myuser/my-driver:<kernelversion.

The name of the unsigned image. For example, quay.io/myuser/my-driver:<kernelversion.
Building and signing a kmod image
Use this procedure if you have source code and must build your image first.

The following YAML file builds a new container image using the source code from the repository. The image produced is saved back in the registry with a temporary name, and this temporary image is then signed using the parameters in the sign section.

The temporary image name is based on the final image name and is set to be <containerImage>:<tag>-<namespace>_<module name>_kmm_unsigned.

For example, using the following YAML file, Kernel Module Management (KMM) builds an image named example.org/repository/minimal-driver:final-default_example-module_kmm_unsigned containing the build with unsigned kmods and pushes it to the registry. Then it creates a second image named example.org/repository/minimal-driver:final that contains the signed kmods. It is this second image that is pulled by the worker pods and contains the kmods to be loaded on the cluster nodes.

After it is signed, you can safely delete the temporary image from the registry. It will be rebuilt, if needed.

The keySecret and certSecret secrets have been created in the same namespace as the rest of the resources.


Apply the YAML file:


Replace default with a valid namespace.

The default serviceAccountName does not have the required permissions to run a module that is privileged. For information on creating a service account, see "Creating service accounts" in the "Additional resources" of this section.

Used as imagePullSecrets in the DaemonSet object and to pull and push for the build and sign features.


Creating service accounts.
KMM hub and spoke
In hub and spoke scenarios, many spoke clusters are connected to a central, powerful hub cluster. Kernel Module Management (KMM) depends on Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) to operate in hub and spoke environments.

KMM is compatible with hub and spoke environments through decoupling KMM features. A ManagedClusterModule custom resource definition (CRD) is provided to wrap the existing Module CRD and extend it to select Spoke clusters. Also provided is KMM-Hub, a new standalone controller that builds images and signs modules on the hub cluster.

In hub and spoke setups, spokes are focused, resource-constrained clusters that are centrally managed by a hub cluster. Spokes run the single-cluster edition of KMM, with those resource-intensive features disabled. To adapt KMM to this environment, you should reduce the workload running on the spokes to the minimum, while the hub takes care of the expensive tasks.

Building kernel module images and signing the .ko files, should run on the hub. The scheduling of the Module Loader and Device Plugin DaemonSets can only happen on the spokes.

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM)


KMM-Hub
The KMM project provides KMM-Hub, an edition of KMM dedicated to hub clusters. KMM-Hub monitors all kernel versions running on the spokes and determines the nodes on the cluster that should receive a kernel module.

KMM-Hub runs all compute-intensive tasks such as image builds and kmod signing, and prepares the trimmed-down Module to be transferred to the spokes through RHACM.

KMM-Hub cannot be used to load kernel modules on the hub cluster. Install the regular edition of KMM to load kernel modules.
Installing KMM
Installing KMM-Hub
You can use one of the following methods to install KMM-Hub:

With the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)

Creating KMM resources


KMM Operator bundle


Installing KMM-Hub using the Operator Lifecycle Manager
Use the Operators section of the OpenShift console to install KMM-Hub.
Installing KMM-Hub by creating KMM resources
If you want to install KMM-Hub programmatically, you can use the following resources to create
the Namespace, OperatorGroup and Subscription resources:


---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: openshift-kmm-hub
---
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: kernel-module-management-hub
  namespace: openshift-kmm-hub
---
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: kernel-module-management-hub
  namespace: openshift-kmm-hub
spec:
  channel: stable
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
  name: kernel-module-management-hub
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
Using the ManagedClusterModule CRD
Use the ManagedClusterModule Custom Resource Definition (CRD) to configure the deployment of kernel modules on spoke clusters. This CRD is cluster-scoped, wraps a Module spec and adds the following additional fields:

apiVersion: hub.kmm.sigs.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ManagedClusterModule
metadata:
  name: <my-mcm>
  # No namespace, because this resource is cluster-scoped.
spec:
  moduleSpec: 1
    selector: 2
      node-wants-my-mcm: 'true'

  spokeNamespace: <some-namespace> 3

  selector: 4
    wants-my-mcm: 'true'
moduleSpec: Contains moduleLoader and devicePlugin sections, similar to a Module resource.

Selects nodes within the ManagedCluster.

Specifies in which namespace the Module should be created.

Selects ManagedCluster objects.


If build or signing instructions are present in .spec.moduleSpec, those pods are run on the hub cluster in the operator's namespace.

When the .spec.selector matches one or more ManagedCluster resources, then KMM-Hub creates a ManifestWork resource in the corresponding namespace(s). ManifestWork contains a trimmed-down Module resource, with kernel mappings preserved but all build and sign subsections are removed. containerImage fields that contain image names ending with a tag are replaced with their digest equivalent.
Running KMM on the spoke
After installing Kernel Module Management (KMM) on the spoke, no further action is required. Create a ManagedClusterModule object from the hub to deploy kernel modules on spoke clusters.

You can install KMM on the spokes cluster through a RHACM Policy object. In addition to installing KMM from the OperatorHub and running it in a lightweight spoke mode, the Policy configures additional RBAC required for the RHACM agent to be able to manage Module resources.

Use the following RHACM policy to install KMM on spoke clusters:
Customizing upgrades for kernel modules
Use this procedure to upgrade the kernel module while running maintenance operations on the node, including rebooting the node, if needed. To minimize the impact on the workloads running in the cluster, run the kernel upgrade process sequentially, one node at a time.

This procedure requires knowledge of the workload utilizing the kernel module and must be managed by the cluster administrator.
Before upgrading, set the kmm.node.kubernetes.io/version-module.<module_namespace>.<module_name>=$moduleVersion label on all the nodes that are used by the kernel module.

Terminate all user application workloads on the node or move them to another node.

Unload the currently loaded kernel module.

Ensure that the user workload (the application running in the cluster that is accessing kernel module) is not running on the node prior to kernel module unloading and that the workload is back running on the node after the new kernel module version has been loaded.


Ensure that the device plugin managed by KMM on the node is unloaded.

Update the following fields in the Module custom resource (CR):

Terminate any workload using the kernel module on the node being upgraded.

Remove the kmm.node.kubernetes.io/version-module.<module_namespace>.<module_name> label on the node.
Run the following command to unload the kernel module from the node:

If required, as the cluster administrator, perform any additional maintenance required on the node for the kernel module upgrade.

Run the following command to add the kmm.node.kubernetes.io/version-module.<module_namespace>.<module_name>=$moduleVersion label to the node. The $moduleVersion must be equal to the new value of the version field in the Module CR.

Restore any workload that leverages the kernel module on the node.

Reload the device plugin managed by KMM on the node.
Day 1 kernel module loading
Kernel Module Management (KMM) is typically a Day 2 Operator. Kernel modules are loaded only after the complete initialization of a Linux (RHCOS) server. However, in some scenarios the kernel module must be loaded at an earlier stage. Day 1 functionality allows you to use the Machine Config Operator (MCO) to load kernel modules during the Linux systemd initialization stage.

Machine Config Operator


Day 1 supported use cases
The Day 1 functionality supports a limited number of use cases. The main use case is to allow loading out-of-tree (OOT) kernel modules prior to NetworkManager service initialization. It does not support loading kernel module at the initramfs stage.

The following are the conditions needed for Day 1 functionality:

The kernel module is not loaded in the kernel.

The in-tree kernel module is loaded into the kernel, but can be unloaded and replaced by the OOT kernel module. This means that the in-tree module is not referenced by any other kernel modules.

In order for Day 1 functionlity to work, the node must have a functional network interface, that is, an in-tree kernel driver for that interface. The OOT kernel module can be a network driver that will replace the functional network driver.
OOT kernel module loading flow
The loading of the out-of-tree (OOT) kernel module leverages the Machine Config Operator (MCO). The flow sequence is as follows:

Apply a MachineConfig resource to the existing running cluster. In order to identify the necessary nodes that need to be updated,
you must create an appropriate MachineConfigPool resource.

MCO applies the reboots node by node. On any rebooted node, two new systemd services are deployed: pull service and load service.

The load service is configured to run prior to the NetworkConfiguration service. The service tries to pull a predefined kernel module image and then, using that image, to unload an in-tree module and load an OOT kernel module.

The pull service is configured to run after NetworkManager service. The service checks if the preconfigured kernel module image is located on the node's filesystem. If it is, the service exists normally, and the server continues with the boot process. If not, it pulls the image onto the node and reboots the node afterwards.
The kernel module image
The Day 1 functionality uses the same DTK based image leveraged by Day 2 KMM builds. The out-of-tree kernel module should be located under /opt/lib/modules/${kernelVersion}.

Driver Toolkit
In-tree module replacement
The Day 1 functionality always tries to replace the in-tree kernel module with the OOT version. If the in-tree kernel module is not loaded, the flow is not affected; the service proceeds and loads the OOT kernel module.
MCO yaml creation
KMM provides an API to create an MCO YAML manifest for the Day 1 functionality:

ProduceMachineConfig(machineConfigName, machineConfigPoolRef, kernelModuleImage, kernelModuleName string) (string, error)
The returned output is a string representation of the MCO YAML manifest to be applied. It is up to the customer to apply this YAML.

The parameters are:


machineConfigName
The name of the MCO YAML manifest. This parameter is set as the name parameter of the metadata of the MCO YAML manifest.
machineConfigPoolRef
The MachineConfigPool name used to identify the targeted nodes.
kernelModuleImage
The name of the container image that includes the OOT kernel module.
kernelModuleName
The name of the OOT kernel module. This parameter is used both to unload the in-tree kernel module (if loaded into the kernel) and to load the OOT kernel module.


The API is located under pkg/mcproducer package of the KMM source code. The KMM operator does not need to be running to use the Day 1 functionality. You only need to import the pkg/mcproducer package into their operator/utility code, call the API, and apply the produced MCO YAML to the cluster.
The MachineConfigPool
The MachineConfigPool identifies a collection of nodes that are affected by the applied MCO.

kind: MachineConfigPool
metadata:
  name: sfc
spec:
  machineConfigSelector: 1
    matchExpressions:
      - {key: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role, operator: In, values: [worker, sfc]}
  nodeSelector: 2
    matchLabels:
      node-role.kubernetes.io/sfc: ""
  paused: false
  maxUnavailable: 1
Matches the labels in the MachineConfig.

Matches the labels on the node.


There are predefined MachineConfigPools in the OCP cluster:

worker: Targets all worker nodes in the cluster

master: Targets all master nodes in the cluster


Define the following MachineConfig to target the master MachineConfigPool:

metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.opensfhit.io/role: master
Define the following MachineConfig to target the worker MachineConfigPool:

metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.opensfhit.io/role: worker

Debugging and troubleshooting
If the kmods in your driver container are not signed or are signed with the wrong key, then the container can enter a PostStartHookError or CrashLoopBackOff status. You can verify by running the oc describe command on your container, which displays the following message in this scenario:

modprobe: ERROR: could not insert '<your_kmod_name>': Required key not available
KMM firmware support
Kernel modules sometimes need to load firmware files from the file system. KMM supports copying firmware files from the kmod image to the node's file system.

The contents of .spec.moduleLoader.container.modprobe.firmwarePath are copied into the /var/lib/firmware path on the node before running the modprobe command to insert the kernel module.

All files and empty directories are removed from that location before running the modprobe -r command to unload the kernel module, when the pod is terminated.

Configuring the lookup path on nodes
On Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform nodes, the set of default lookup paths for firmwares does not include the /var/lib/firmware path.

Use the Machine Config Operator to create a MachineConfig custom resource (CR) that contains the /var/lib/firmware path:

By applying the MachineConfig CR, the nodes are automatically rebooted.

Building a kmod image
In addition to building the kernel module itself, include the binary firmware in the builder image:
Tuning the Module resource
Set .spec.moduleLoader.container.modprobe.firmwarePath in the Module custom resource (CR):
Day 0 through Day 2 kmod installation
You can install some kernel modules (kmods) during Day 0 through Day 2 operations without Kernel Module Management (KMM). This could assist in the transition of the kmods to KMM.

Use the following criteria to determine suitable kmod installations.


Day 0
The most basic kmods that are required for a node to become Ready in the cluster. Examples of these types of kmods include:
Day 1
Kmods that are not required for a node to become Ready in the cluster but cannot be unloaded when the node is Ready.
Day 2
Kmods that can be dynamically loaded to the kernel or removed from it without interfering with the cluster infrastructure, for example, connectivity.


Layering background
When a Day 0 kmod is installed in the cluster, layering is applied through the Machine Config Operator (MCO) and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform upgrades do not trigger node upgrades.

You only need to recompile the driver if you add new features to it, because the node’s operating system will remain the same.
Lifecycle management
You can leverage KMM to manage the Day 0 through Day 2 lifecycle of kmods without a reboot when the driver allows it.

This will not work if the upgrade requires a node reboot, for example, when rebuilding initramfs files is needed.
Use one of the following options for lifecycle management.

Treat the kmod as an in-tree driver
Use this method when you want to upgrade the kmods. In this case, treat the kmod as an in-tree driver and create a Module in the cluster with the inTreeRemoval field to unload the old version of the driver.

Note the following characteristics of treating the kmod as an in-tree driver:

Downtime might occur as KMM tries to unload and load the kmod on all the selected nodes simultaneously.

This works if removing the driver makes the node lose connectivity because KMM uses a single pod to unload and load the driver.
Use ordered upgrade
You can use ordered upgrade (ordered_upgrade.md) to create a versioned Module in the cluster representing the kmods with no effect, because the kmods are already loaded.

Note the following characteristics of using ordered upgrade:

There is no cluster downtime because you control the pace of the upgrade and how many nodes are upgraded at the same time; therefore, an upgrade with no downtime is possible.

This method will not work if unloading the driver results in losing connection to the node, because KMM creates two different worker pods for unloading and another for loading. These pods will not be scheduled.
Troubleshooting KMM
When troubleshooting KMM installation issues, you can monitor logs to determine at which stage issues occur. Then, retrieve diagnostic data relevant to that stage.

Reading Operator logs
You can use the oc logs command to read Operator logs, as in the following examples.

$ oc logs -fn openshift-kmm deployments/kmm-operator-controller
$ oc logs -fn openshift-kmm-hub deployments/kmm-operator-hub-controller
Observing events
Use the following methods to view KMM events.


KMM publishes events whenever it starts a kmod image build or observes its outcome. These events are attached to Module objects and are available at the end of the output of oc describe module command, as in the following example:

$ oc describe modules.kmm.sigs.x-k8s.io kmm-ci-a
[...]
Events:
  Type    Reason          Age                From  Message
  ----    ------          ----               ----  -------
  Normal  BuildCreated    2m29s              kmm   Build created for kernel 6.6.2-201.fc39.x86_64
  Normal  BuildSucceeded  63s                kmm   Build job succeeded for kernel 6.6.2-201.fc39.x86_64
  Normal  SignCreated     64s (x2 over 64s)  kmm   Sign created for kernel 6.6.2-201.fc39.x86_64
  Normal  SignSucceeded   57s                kmm   Sign job succeeded for kernel 6.6.2-201.fc39.x86_64

KMM publishes events whenever it successfully loads or unloads a kernel module on a node. These events are attached to Node objects and are available at the end of the output of oc describe node command, as in the following example:

$ oc describe node my-node
[...]
Events:
  Type    Reason          Age    From  Message
  ----    ------          ----   ----  -------
