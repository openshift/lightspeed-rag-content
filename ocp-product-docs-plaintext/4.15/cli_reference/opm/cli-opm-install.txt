# About the opm CLI

The opm CLI tool is provided by the Operator Framework for use with the Operator bundle format. This tool allows you to create and maintain catalogs of Operators from a list of Operator bundles that are similar to software repositories. The result is a container image which can be stored in a container registry and then installed on a cluster.

A catalog contains a database of pointers to Operator manifest content that can be queried through an included API that is served when the container image is run. On Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) can reference the image in a catalog source, defined by a CatalogSource object, which polls the image at regular intervals to enable frequent updates to installed Operators on the cluster.

* See Operator Framework packaging format for more information about the bundle format.
* To create a bundle image using the Operator SDK, see
Working with bundle images.

# Installing the opm CLI

You can install the opm CLI tool on your Linux, macOS, or Windows workstation.

* For Linux, you must provide the following packages:
* podman version 1.9.3+ (version 2.0+ recommended)
* glibc version 2.28+

1. Navigate to the OpenShift mirror site and download the latest version of the tarball that matches your operating system.

[IMPORTANT]
----
There is currently a known issue where the version of the opm CLI tool released with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15 does not support RHEL 8. As a workaround, RHEL 8 users can navigate to the OpenShift mirror site and download the latest version of the tarball released with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14.
