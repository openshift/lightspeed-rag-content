Managing CLI profiles

A CLI configuration file allows you to configure different profiles, or contexts, for use with the CLI tools overview. A context consists of user authentication an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" server information associated with a nickname.
About switches between CLI profiles
Contexts allow you to easily switch between multiple users across multiple "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" servers, or clusters, when using CLI operations. Nicknames make managing CLI configurations easier by providing short-hand references to contexts, user credentials, and cluster details. After a user logs in with the oc CLI for the first time, "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" creates a ~/.kube/config file if one does not already exist. As more authentication and connection details are provided to the CLI, either automatically during an oc login operation or by manually configuring CLI profiles, the updated information is stored in the configuration file:

apiVersion: v1
clusters: 1
- cluster:
    insecure-skip-tls-verify: true
    server: https://openshift1.example.com:8443
  name: openshift1.example.com:8443
- cluster:
    insecure-skip-tls-verify: true
    server: https://openshift2.example.com:8443
  name: openshift2.example.com:8443
contexts: 2
- context:
    cluster: openshift1.example.com:8443
    namespace: alice-project
    user: alice/openshift1.example.com:8443
  name: alice-project/openshift1.example.com:8443/alice
- context:
    cluster: openshift1.example.com:8443
    namespace: joe-project
    user: alice/openshift1.example.com:8443
  name: joe-project/openshift1/alice
current-context: joe-project/openshift1.example.com:8443/alice 3
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users: 4
- name: alice/openshift1.example.com:8443
  user:
    token: xZHd2piv5_9vQrg-SKXRJ2Dsl9SceNJdhNTljEKTb8k
The clusters section defines connection details for
"Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform"
clusters, including the address for their master server. In this example, one cluster is nicknamed openshift1.example.com:8443 and another is nicknamed openshift2.example.com:8443.

This contexts section defines two contexts: one nicknamed alice-project/openshift1.example.com:8443/alice, using the alice-project project, openshift1.example.com:8443 cluster, and alice user, and another nicknamed joe-project/openshift1.example.com:8443/alice, using the joe-project project, openshift1.example.com:8443 cluster and alice user.

The current-context parameter shows that the joe-project/openshift1.example.com:8443/alice context is currently in use, allowing the alice user to work in the joe-project project on the openshift1.example.com:8443 cluster.

The users section defines user credentials. In this example, the user nickname alice/openshift1.example.com:8443 uses an access token.


The CLI can support multiple configuration files which are loaded at runtime and merged together along with any override options specified from the command line. After you are logged in, you can use the oc status or oc project command to verify your current working environment:

$ oc status
oc status
In project Joe's Project (joe-project)

service database (172.30.43.12:5434 -> 3306)
  database deploys docker.io/openshift/mysql-55-centos7:latest
    #1 deployed 25 minutes ago - 1 pod

service frontend (172.30.159.137:5432 -> 8080)
  frontend deploys origin-ruby-sample:latest <-
    builds https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world with joe-project/ruby-20-centos7:latest
    #1 deployed 22 minutes ago - 2 pods

To see more information about a service or deployment, use 'oc describe service <name>' or 'oc describe dc <name>'.
You can use 'oc get all' to see lists of each of the types described in this example.
$ oc project
Using project "joe-project" from context named "joe-project/openshift1.example.com:8443/alice" on server "https://openshift1.example.com:8443".
You can run the oc login command again and supply the required information during the interactive process, to log in using any other combination of user credentials and cluster details. A context is constructed based on the supplied information if one does not already exist. If you are already logged in and want to switch to another project the current user already has access to, use the oc project command and enter the name of the project:

$ oc project alice-project
Now using project "alice-project" on server "https://openshift1.example.com:8443".
At any time, you can use the oc config view command to view your current CLI configuration, as seen in the output. Additional CLI configuration commands are also available for more advanced usage.

If you have access to administrator credentials but are no longer logged in as the default system user system:admin, you can log back in as this user at any time as long as the credentials are still present in your CLI config file. The following command logs in and switches to the default project:

$ oc login -u system:admin -n default
Manual configuration of CLI profiles
This section covers more advanced usage of CLI configurations. In most situations, you can use the oc login and oc project commands to log in and switch between contexts and projects.
If you want to manually configure your CLI config files, you can use the oc config command instead of directly modifying the files. The oc config command includes a number of helpful sub-commands for this purpose:


Log in as a user that uses an access token.
This token is used by the alice user:


$ oc login https://openshift1.example.com --token=ns7yVhuRNpDM9cgzfhhxQ7bM5s7N2ZVrkZepSRf4LC0
View the cluster entry automatically created:


$ oc config view
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    insecure-skip-tls-verify: true
    server: https://openshift1.example.com
  name: openshift1-example-com
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: openshift1-example-com
    namespace: default
    user: alice/openshift1-example-com
  name: default/openshift1-example-com/alice
current-context: default/openshift1-example-com/alice
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: alice/openshift1.example.com
  user:
    token: ns7yVhuRNpDM9cgzfhhxQ7bM5s7N2ZVrkZepSRf4LC0
Update the current context to have users log in to the desired namespace:


$ oc config set-context `oc config current-context` --namespace=<project_name>
Examine the current context, to confirm that the changes are implemented:


$ oc whoami -c
All subsequent CLI operations uses the new context, unless otherwise specified by overriding CLI options or until the context is switched.
Load and merge rules
You can follow these rules, when issuing CLI operations for the loading and merging order for the CLI configuration:

CLI config files are retrieved from your workstation, using the following hierarchy and merge rules:

The context to use is determined based on the first match in the following flow:

The user and cluster to use is determined. At this point, you may or may not have a context; they are built based on the first match in the following flow, which is run once for the user and once for the cluster:

The actual cluster information to use is determined. At this point, you may or may not have cluster information. Each piece of the cluster information is built based on the first match in the following flow:

The actual user information to use is determined. Users are built using the same rules as clusters, except that you can only have one authentication technique per user; conflicting techniques cause the operation to fail. Command line options take precedence over config file values. Valid command line options are:

For any information that is still missing, default values are used and prompts are given for additional information.
