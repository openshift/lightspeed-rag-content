Must have root or sudo privileges.


Register with Red Hat Subscription Manager:

Pull the latest subscription data:

List the available subscriptions:

In the output for the previous command, find the pool ID for
an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
subscription and attach the subscription to the registered system:

$ oc <command>
Installing the OpenShift CLI by using Homebrew
For macOS, you can install the OpenShift CLI (oc) by using the Homebrew package manager.

You must have Homebrew (brew) installed.


Run the following command to install the openshift-cli package:
Logging in to the OpenShift CLI
You can log in to the OpenShift CLI (oc) to access and manage your cluster.

You must have access to
an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
cluster.

The OpenShift CLI (`oc`) is installed.


To access a cluster that is accessible only over an HTTP proxy server, you can set the HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY and NO_PROXY variables. These environment variables are respected by the oc CLI so that all communication with the cluster goes through the HTTP proxy.

Authentication headers are sent only when using HTTPS transport.
Enter the oc login command and pass in a user name:

When prompted, enter the required information:


If you are logged in to the web console, you can generate an oc login command that includes your token and server information. You can use the command to log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI without the interactive prompts. To generate the command, select Copy login command from the username drop-down menu at the top right of the web console.
You can now create a project or issue other commands for managing your cluster.
Logging in to the OpenShift CLI using a web browser
You can log in to the OpenShift CLI (oc) with the help of a web browser to access and manage your cluster. This allows users to avoid inserting their access token into the command line.

Logging in to the CLI through the web browser runs a server on localhost with HTTP, not HTTPS; use with caution on multi-user workstations.
You must have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

You must have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You must have a browser installed.


Enter the oc login command with the --web flag:

The web browser opens automatically. If it does not, click the link in the command output. If you do not specify the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform server oc tries to open the web console of the cluster specified in the current oc configuration file. If no oc configuration exists, oc prompts interactively for the server URL.

If more than one identity provider is available, select your choice from the options provided.

Enter your username and password into the corresponding browser fields. After you are logged in, the browser displays the text access token received successfully; please return to your terminal.

Check the CLI for a login confirmation.


The web console defaults to the profile used in the previous session. To switch between Administrator and Developer profiles, log out of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console and clear the cache.
You can now create a project or issue other commands for managing your cluster.
