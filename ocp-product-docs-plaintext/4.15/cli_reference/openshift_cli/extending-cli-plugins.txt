Extending the OpenShift CLI with plugins

You can write and install plugins to build on the default oc commands, allowing you to perform new and more complex tasks with the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI.
Writing CLI plugins
You can write a plugin for the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI in any programming language or script that allows you to write command-line commands. Note that you can not use a plugin to overwrite an existing oc command.

This procedure creates a simple Bash plugin that prints a message to the terminal when the oc foo command is issued.

Create a file called oc-foo.

Add the following contents to the file.


After you install this plugin for the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI, it can be invoked using the oc foo command.

Review the Sample plugin repository
for an example of a plugin written in Go.

Review the CLI runtime repository for a set of utilities to assist in writing plugins in Go.
Installing and using CLI plugins
After you write a custom plugin for the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI, you must install the plugin before use.

You must have the oc CLI tool installed.

You must have a CLI plugin file that begins with oc- or kubectl-.


If necessary, update the plugin file to be executable.

Place the file anywhere in your PATH, such as /usr/local/bin/.

Run oc plugin list to make sure that the plugin is listed.

Invoke the new command or option introduced by the plugin.
