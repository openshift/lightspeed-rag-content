Gathering data about your cluster update

When reaching out to Red Hat support for issues with an update, it is important to provide data for the support team to use for troubleshooting your failed cluster update.
Gathering log data for a support case
To gather data from your cluster, including log data, use the oc adm must-gather command. See Gathering data about your cluster.
Gathering ClusterVersion history
The Cluster Version Operator (CVO) records updates made to a cluster, known as the ClusterVersion history. The entries can reveal correlation between changes in cluster behavior with potential triggers, although correlation does not imply causation.

The initial, minor, and z-stream version updates are stored by the ClusterVersion history. However, the ClusterVersion history has a size limit. If the limit is reached, the oldest z-stream updates in previous minor versions are pruned to accommodate the limit.
You can view the ClusterVersion history by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console or by using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
