Mirroring Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform images

You must mirror container images onto a mirror registry before you can update a cluster in a disconnected environment. You can also use this procedure in connected environments to ensure your clusters run only approved container images that have satisfied your organizational controls for external content.

Your mirror registry must be running at all times while the cluster is running.
The following steps outline the high-level workflow on how to mirror images to a mirror registry:

Install the OpenShift CLI (oc) on all devices being used to retrieve and push release images.

Download the registry pull secret and add it to your cluster.

If you use the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI (oc) plugin:

If you use the oc adm release mirror command:


Compared to using the oc adm release mirror command, the oc-mirror plugin has the following advantages:

It can mirror content other than container images.

After mirroring images for the first time, it is easier to update images in the registry.

The oc-mirror plugin provides an automated way to mirror the release payload from Quay, and also builds the latest graph data image for the OpenShift Update Service running in the disconnected environment.
Mirroring resources using the oc-mirror plugin
You can use the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI (oc) plugin to mirror images to a mirror registry in your fully or partially disconnected environments. You must run oc-mirror from a system with internet connectivity to download the required images from the official Red Hat registries.

See Mirroring images for a disconnected installation using the oc-mirror plugin for additional details.
Mirroring images using the oc adm release mirror command
You can use the oc adm release mirror command to mirror images to your mirror registry.

Prerequisites
You must have a container image registry that supports Docker v2-2 in the location that will host the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, such as Red Hat Quay.
Preparing your mirror host
Before you perform the mirror procedure, you must prepare the host to retrieve content and push it to the remote location.

Installing the OpenShift CLI by downloading the binary
You can install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) to interact with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform from a command-line interface. You can install oc on Linux, Windows, or macOS.

If you installed an earlier version of oc, you cannot use it to complete all of the commands in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15. Download and install the new version of oc. If you are updating a cluster in a disconnected environment, install the oc version that you plan to update to.

You can install the OpenShift CLI (oc) binary on Linux by using the following procedure.

Navigate to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform downloads page on the Red Hat Customer Portal.

Select the architecture from the Product Variant drop-down list.

Select the appropriate version from the Version drop-down list.

Click Download Now next to the OpenShift v4.15 Linux Client entry and save the file.

Unpack the archive:

Place the oc binary in a directory that is on your PATH.


After you install the OpenShift CLI, it is available using the oc command:



You can install the OpenShift CLI (oc) binary on Windows by using the following procedure.

Navigate to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform downloads page on the Red Hat Customer Portal.

Select the appropriate version from the Version drop-down list.

Click Download Now next to the OpenShift v4.15 Windows Client entry and save the file.

Unzip the archive with a ZIP program.

Move the oc binary to a directory that is on your PATH.


After you install the OpenShift CLI, it is available using the oc command:



You can install the OpenShift CLI (oc) binary on macOS by using the following procedure.

Navigate to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform downloads page on the Red Hat Customer Portal.

Select the appropriate version from the Version drop-down list.

Click Download Now next to the OpenShift v4.15 macOS Client entry and save the file.

Unpack and unzip the archive.

Move the oc binary to a directory on your PATH.


After you install the OpenShift CLI, it is available using the oc command:


Installing and using CLI plugins
Configuring credentials that allow images to be mirrored
Create a container image registry credentials file that allows mirroring images from Red Hat to your mirror.

Do not use this image registry credentials file as the pull secret when you install a cluster. If you provide this file when you install cluster, all of the machines in the cluster will have write access to your mirror registry.
This process requires that you have write access to a container image registry on the mirror registry and adds the credentials to a registry pull secret.
You configured a mirror registry to use in your disconnected environment.

You identified an image repository location on your mirror registry to mirror images into.

You provisioned a mirror registry account that allows images to be uploaded to that image repository.


Complete the following steps on the installation host:

Download your registry.redhat.io https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret [pull secret from the Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager].

Make a copy of your pull secret in JSON format:

Optional: If using the oc-mirror plugin, save the file either as ~/.docker/config.json or $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/containers/auth.json.

Generate the base64-encoded user name and password or token for your mirror registry:

Edit the JSON
file and add a section that describes your registry to it:
Mirroring images to a mirror registry
To avoid excessive memory usage by the OpenShift Update Service application, you must mirror release images to a separate repository as described in the following procedure.
You configured a mirror registry to use in your disconnected environment and can access the certificate and credentials that you configured.

You downloaded the https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret [pull secret from the Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager] and modified it to include authentication to your mirror repository.

If you use self-signed certificates, you have specified a Subject Alternative Name in the certificates.


Use the Red Hat Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Update Graph visualizer and update planner to plan an update from one version to another. The OpenShift Update Graph provides channel graphs and a way to confirm that there is an update path between your current and intended cluster versions.

Set the required environment variables:
