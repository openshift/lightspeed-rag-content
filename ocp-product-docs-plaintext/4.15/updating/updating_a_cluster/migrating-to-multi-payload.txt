Migrating to a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines

You can migrate your current cluster with single-architecture compute machines to a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines by updating to a multi-architecture, manifest-listed payload. This allows you to add mixed architecture compute nodes to your cluster.

For information about configuring your multi-architecture compute machines, see Configuring multi-architecture compute machines on an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

Migration from a multi-architecture payload to a single-architecture payload is not supported. Once a cluster has transitioned to using a multi-architecture payload, it can no longer accept a single-architecture update payload.
Migrating to a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines using the CLI
You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

Your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version is up to date to at least version 4.13.0.

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc) that matches the version for your current cluster.

Your oc client is updated to at least verion 4.13.0.

Your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster is installed on AWS, Azure, GCP, bare metal or IBM P/Z platforms.


Verify that the RetrievedUpdates condition is True in the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) by running the following command:

If the condition RetrievedUpdates is False, change the channel to stable-<4.y> or fast-<4.y> with the following command:

Migrate to the multi-architecture payload with following command:


You can monitor the migration by running the following command:
