Using the Insights Operator

The Insights Operator periodically gathers configuration and component failure status and, by default, reports that data every two hours to Red Hat. This information enables Red Hat to assess configuration and deeper failure data than is reported through Telemetry. Users of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform can display the report in the https://console.redhat.com/openshift/insights/advisor/ [Insights Advisor] service on Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console.

The Insights Operator is installed and enabled by default. If you need to opt out of remote health reporting, see Opting out of remote health reporting.

For more information on using Insights Advisor to identify issues with your cluster, see Using Insights to identify issues with your cluster.
Configuring Insights Operator
Insights Operator configuration is a combination of the default Operator configuration and the configuration that is stored in either the insights-config ConfigMap object in the openshift-insights namespace, OR in the support secret in the openshift-config namespace.

When a ConfigMap object or support secret exists, the contained attribute values override the default Operator configuration values. If both a ConfigMap object and a support secret exist, the Operator reads the ConfigMap object.

The ConfigMap object does not exist by default, so an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster administrator must create it.

This example of an insights-config ConfigMap object (config.yaml configuration) shows configuration options using standard YAML formatting.


The table below describes the available configuration attributes:

The insights-config ConfigMap object follows standard YAML formatting, wherein child values are below the parent attribute and indented two spaces. For the Obfuscation attribute, enter values as bulleted children of the parent attribute.

Creating the insights-config ConfigMap object
This procedure describes how to create the insights-config ConfigMap object for the Insights Operator to set custom configurations.

Red Hat recommends you consult Red Hat Support before making changes to the default Insights Operator configuration.
Remote health reporting is enabled, which is the default.

You are logged in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console as a user with cluster-admin role.


Go to Workloads -> ConfigMaps and select Project: openshift-insights.

Click Create ConfigMap.

Select Configure via: YAML view and enter your configuration preferences, for example

Optional: Select Form view and enter the necessary information that way.

In the ConfigMap Name field, enter insights-config.

In the Key field, enter config.yaml.

For the Value field, either browse for a file to drag and drop into the field or enter your configuration parameters manually.

Click Create and you can see the ConfigMap object and configuration information.
Understanding Insights Operator alerts
The Insights Operator declares alerts through the Prometheus monitoring system to the Alertmanager. You can view these alerts in the Alerting UI in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console by using one of the following methods:

In the Administrator perspective, click Observe -> Alerting.

In the Developer perspective, click Observe -> <project_name> -> Alerts tab.


Currently, Insights Operator sends the following alerts when the conditions are met:


Disabling Insights Operator alerts
To prevent the Insights Operator from sending alerts to the cluster Prometheus instance, you create or edit the insights-config ConfigMap object.

Previously, a cluster administrator would create or edit the Insights Operator configuration using a support secret in the openshift-config namespace. Red Hat Insights now supports the creation of a ConfigMap object to configure the Operator. The Operator gives preference to the config map configuration over the support secret if both exist.
If the insights-config ConfigMap object does not exist, you must create it when you first add custom configurations. Note that configurations within the ConfigMap object take precedence over the default settings defined in the config/pod.yaml file.

Remote health reporting is enabled, which is the default.

You are logged in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console as cluster-admin.

The insights-config ConfigMap object exists in the openshift-insights namespace.


Go to Workloads -> ConfigMaps and select Project: openshift-insights.

Click on the insights-config ConfigMap object to open it.

Click Actions and select Edit ConfigMap.

Click the YAML view radio button.

In the file, set the alerting attribute to disabled: true.

Click Save. The insights-config config-map details page opens.

Verify that the value of the config.yaml alerting attribute is set to disabled: true.


After you save the changes, Insights Operator no longer sends alerts to the cluster Prometheus instance.
Enabling Insights Operator alerts
When alerts are disabled, the Insights Operator no longer sends alerts to the cluster Prometheus instance. You can reenable them.

Previously, a cluster administrator would create or edit the Insights Operator configuration using a support secret in the openshift-config namespace. Red Hat Insights now supports the creation of a ConfigMap object to configure the Operator. The Operator gives preference to the config map configuration over the support secret if both exist.
Remote health reporting is enabled, which is the default.

You are logged in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console as cluster-admin.

In the file, set the alerting attribute to disabled: false.

Click Save. The insights-config config-map details page opens.

Verify that the value of the config.yaml alerting attribute is set to disabled: false.


After you save the changes, Insights Operator again sends alerts to the cluster Prometheus instance.
Downloading your Insights Operator archive
Insights Operator stores gathered data in an archive located in the openshift-insights namespace of your cluster. You can download and review the data that is gathered by the Insights Operator.

You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

Copy the recent data archives collected by the Insights Operator:


The recent Insights Operator archives are now available in the insights-data directory.
Running an Insights Operator gather operation
You can run Insights Operator data gather operations on demand. The following procedures describe how to run the default list of gather operations using the OpenShift web console or CLI. You can customize the on demand gather function to exclude any gather operations you choose. Disabling gather operations from the default list degrades Insights Advisor's ability to offer effective recommendations for your cluster. If you have previously disabled Insights Operator gather operations in your cluster, this procedure will override those parameters.

The DataGather custom resource is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
If you enable Technology Preview in your cluster, the Insights Operator runs gather operations in individual pods. This is part of the Technology Preview feature set for the Insights Operator and supports the new data gathering features.
Viewing Insights Operator gather durations
You can view the time it takes for the Insights Operator to gather the information contained in the archive. This helps you to understand Insights Operator resource usage and issues with Insights Advisor.

Disabling the Insights Operator gather operations
You can disable the Insights Operator gather operations. Disabling the gather operations gives you the ability to increase privacy for your organization as Insights Operator will no longer gather and send Insights cluster reports to Red Hat. This will disable Insights analysis and recommendations for your cluster without affecting other core functions that require communication with Red Hat such as cluster transfers. You can view a list of attempted gather operations for your cluster from the /insights-operator/gathers.json file in your Insights Operator archive. Be aware that some gather operations only occur when certain conditions are met and might not appear in your most recent archive.

Obfuscating Deployment Validation Operator data
Cluster administrators can configure the Insight Operator to obfuscate data from the Deployment Validation Operator (DVO), if the Operator is installed. When the workload_names value is added to the insights-config ConfigMap object, workload names—rather than UIDs—are displayed in Insights for Openshift, making them more recognizable for cluster administrators.

Remote health reporting is enabled, which is the default.

You are logged in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console with the "cluster-admin" role.

The insights-config ConfigMap object exists in the openshift-insights namespace.
