# About remote health monitoring


Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform collects telemetry and configuration data about your cluster and reports it to Red Hat by using the Telemeter Client and the Insights Operator. The data that is provided to Red Hat enables the benefits outlined in this document.
A cluster that reports data to Red Hat through Telemetry and the Insights Operator is considered a connected cluster.
Telemetry is the term that Red Hat uses to describe the information being sent to Red Hat by the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Telemeter Client. Lightweight attributes are sent from connected clusters to Red Hat to enable subscription management automation, monitor the health of clusters, assist with support, and improve customer experience.
The Insights Operator gathers Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform configuration data and sends it to Red Hat. The data is used to produce insights about potential issues that a cluster might be exposed to. These insights are communicated to cluster administrators on https://console.redhat.com/openshift [OpenShift Cluster Manager].
More information is provided in this document about these two processes.
Telemetry and the Insights Operator enable the following benefits for end-users:
* Enhanced identification and resolution of issues. Events that might seem normal to an end-user can be observed by Red Hat from a broader perspective across a fleet of clusters. Some issues can be more rapidly identified from this point of view and resolved without an end-user needing to open a support case or file a Jira issue.
* Advanced release management. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform offers the candidate, fast, and stable release channels, which enable you to choose an update strategy. The graduation of a release from fast to stable is dependent on the success rate of updates and on the events seen during upgrades. With the information provided by connected clusters, Red Hat can improve the quality of releases to stable channels and react more rapidly to issues found in the fast channels.
* Targeted prioritization of new features and functionality. The data collected provides insights about which areas of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform are used most. With this information, Red Hat can focus on developing the new features and functionality that have the greatest impact for our customers.
* A streamlined support experience. You can provide a cluster ID for a connected cluster when creating a support ticket on the Red Hat Customer Portal. This enables Red Hat to deliver a streamlined support experience that is specific to your cluster, by using the connected information. This document provides more information about that enhanced support experience.
* Predictive analytics. The insights displayed for your cluster on https://console.redhat.com/openshift [OpenShift Cluster Manager] are enabled by the information collected from connected clusters. Red Hat is investing in applying deep learning, machine learning, and artificial intelligence automation to help identify issues that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters are exposed to.

# About Telemetry

Telemetry sends a carefully chosen subset of the cluster monitoring metrics to Red Hat. The Telemeter Client fetches the metrics values every four minutes and thirty seconds and uploads the data to Red Hat. These metrics are described in this document.

This stream of data is used by Red Hat to monitor the clusters in real-time and to react as necessary to problems that impact our customers. It also allows Red Hat to roll out Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform upgrades to customers to minimize service impact and continuously improve the upgrade experience.

This debugging information is available to Red Hat Support and Engineering teams with the same restrictions as accessing data reported through support cases. All connected cluster information is used by Red Hat to help make Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform better and more intuitive to use.

* See the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform update documentation for more information about updating or upgrading a cluster.

* See the upstream cluster-monitoring-operator source code for a list of the attributes that Telemetry gathers from Prometheus.
* Telemetry is installed and enabled by default. If you need to opt out of remote health reporting, see Opting out of remote health reporting.

# About the Insights Operator

The Insights Operator periodically gathers configuration and component failure status and, by default, reports that data every two hours to Red Hat. This information enables Red Hat to assess configuration and deeper failure data than is reported through Telemetry.

Users of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform can display the report of each cluster in the https://console.redhat.com/openshift/insights/advisor/ [Insights Advisor] service on Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console. If any issues have been identified, Insights provides further details and, if available, steps on how to solve a problem.

The Insights Operator does not collect identifying information, such as user names, passwords, or certificates. See Red Hat Insights Data & Application Security for information about Red Hat Insights data collection and controls.

Red Hat uses all connected cluster information to:

* Identify potential cluster issues and provide a solution and preventive actions in the https://console.redhat.com/openshift/insights/advisor/ [Insights Advisor] service on Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console
* Improve Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform by providing aggregated and critical information to product and support teams
* Make Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform more intuitive

* The Insights Operator is installed and enabled by default. If you need to opt out of remote health reporting, see Opting out of remote health reporting.

## Information collected by the Insights Operator

The following information is collected by the Insights Operator:

* General information about your cluster and its components to identify issues that are specific to your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version and environment
* Configuration files, such as the image registry configuration, of your cluster to determine incorrect settings and issues that are specific to parameters you set
* Errors that occur in the cluster components
* Progress information of running updates, and the status of any component upgrades

# Understanding Telemetry and Insights Operator data flow

The Telemeter Client collects selected time series data from the Prometheus API. The time series data is uploaded to api.openshift.com every four minutes and thirty seconds for processing.

The Insights Operator gathers selected data from the Kubernetes API and the Prometheus API into an archive. The archive is uploaded to https://console.redhat.com/openshift [OpenShift Cluster Manager] every two hours for processing. The Insights Operator also downloads the latest Insights analysis from https://console.redhat.com/openshift [OpenShift Cluster Manager]. This is used to populate the Insights status pop-up that is included in the Overview page in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

All of the communication with Red Hat occurs over encrypted channels by using Transport Layer Security (TLS) and mutual certificate authentication. All of the data is encrypted in transit and at rest.

Access to the systems that handle customer data is controlled through multi-factor authentication and strict authorization controls. Access is granted on a need-to-know basis and is limited to required operations.
