If you or your organization have disabled remote health reporting, you can enable this feature again. You can see that remote health reporting is disabled from the message "Insights not available" in the Status tile on the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Web Console Overview page.

To enable remote health reporting, you must Modify the global cluster pull secret with a new authorization token.

Enabling remote health reporting enables both Insights Operator and Telemetry.
