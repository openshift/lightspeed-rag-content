Querying the kubelet's status on a node
You can review cluster node health status, resource consumption statistics, and node logs. Additionally, you can query kubelet status on individual nodes.

You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

Your API service is still functional.

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).


The kubelet is managed using a systemd service on each node. Review the kubelet's status by querying the kubelet systemd service within a debug pod.
Querying cluster node journal logs
You can gather journald unit logs and other logs within /var/log on individual cluster nodes.

You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

Your API service is still functional.

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You have SSH access to your hosts.


Query kubelet journald unit logs from "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster nodes. The following example queries control plane nodes only:
