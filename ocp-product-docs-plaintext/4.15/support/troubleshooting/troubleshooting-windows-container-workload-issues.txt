Troubleshooting Windows container workload issues

Windows Machine Config Operator does not install
If you have completed the process of installing the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO), but the Operator is stuck in the InstallWaiting phase, your issue is likely caused by a networking issue.

The WMCO requires your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster to be configured with hybrid networking using OVN-Kubernetes; the WMCO cannot complete the installation process without hybrid networking available. This is necessary to manage nodes on multiple operating systems (OS) and OS variants. This must be completed during the installation of your cluster.

For more information, see Configuring hybrid networking.
Investigating why Windows Machine does not become compute node
There are various reasons why a Windows Machine does not become a compute node. The best way to investigate this problem is to collect the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) logs.

You installed the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

You have created a Windows compute machine set.


Run the following command to collect the WMCO logs:
Accessing a Windows node
Windows nodes cannot be accessed using the oc debug node command; the command requires running a privileged pod on the node, which is not yet supported for Windows. Instead, a Windows node can be accessed using a secure shell (SSH) or Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). An SSH bastion is required for both methods.

Accessing a Windows node using SSH
You can access a Windows node by using a secure shell (SSH).

You have installed the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

You have created a Windows compute machine set.

You have added the key used in the cloud-private-key secret and the key used when creating the cluster to the ssh-agent. For security reasons, remember to remove the keys from the ssh-agent after use.

You have connected to the Windows node using an ssh-bastion pod.


Access the Windows node by running the following command:
Accessing a Windows node using RDP
You can access a Windows node by using a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

You installed the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

You have created a Windows compute machine set.

You have added the key used in the cloud-private-key secret and the key used when creating the cluster to the ssh-agent. For security reasons, remember to remove the keys from the ssh-agent after use.

You have connected to the Windows node using an ssh-bastion pod.


Run the following command to set up an SSH tunnel:

From within the resulting shell, SSH into the Windows node and run the following command to create a password for the user:


You can now remotely access the Windows node at localhost:2020 using an RDP client.
Collecting Kubernetes node logs for Windows containers
Windows container logging works differently from Linux container logging; the Kubernetes node logs for Windows workloads are streamed to the C:\var\logs directory by default. Therefore, you must gather the Windows node logs from that directory.

You installed the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

You have created a Windows compute machine set.


To view the logs under all directories in C:\var\logs, run the following command:

You can now list files in the directories using the same command and view the individual log files. For example, to view the kubelet logs, run the following command:
Collecting Windows application event logs
The Get-WinEvent shim on the kubelet logs endpoint can be used to collect application event logs from Windows machines.

You installed the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

You have created a Windows compute machine set.


To view logs from all applications logging to the event logs on the Windows machine, run:
Collecting Docker logs for Windows containers
The Windows Docker service does not stream its logs to stdout, but instead, logs to the event log for Windows. You can view the Docker event logs to investigate issues you think might be caused by the Windows Docker service.

You installed the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

You have created a Windows compute machine set.


SSH into the Windows node and enter PowerShell:
