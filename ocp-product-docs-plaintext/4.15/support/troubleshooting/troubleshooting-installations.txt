Troubleshooting installations

Determining where installation issues occur
When troubleshooting Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation issues, you can monitor installation logs to determine at which stage issues occur. Then, retrieve diagnostic data relevant to that stage.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation proceeds through the following stages:

Ignition configuration files are created.

The bootstrap machine boots and starts hosting the remote resources required for the control plane machines to boot.

The control plane machines fetch the remote resources from the bootstrap machine and finish booting.

The control plane machines use the bootstrap machine to form an etcd cluster.

The bootstrap machine starts a temporary Kubernetes control plane using the new etcd cluster.

The temporary control plane schedules the production control plane to the control plane machines.

The temporary control plane shuts down and passes control to the production control plane.

The bootstrap machine adds Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform components into the production control plane.

The installation program shuts down the bootstrap machine.

The control plane sets up the worker nodes.

The control plane installs additional services in the form of a set of Operators.

The cluster downloads and configures remaining components needed for the day-to-day operation, including the creation of worker machines in supported environments.
User-provisioned infrastructure installation considerations
The default installation method uses installer-provisioned infrastructure. With installer-provisioned infrastructure clusters, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform manages all aspects of the cluster, including the operating system itself. If possible, use this feature to avoid having to provision and maintain the cluster infrastructure.

You can alternatively install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15 on infrastructure that you provide. If you use this installation method, follow user-provisioned infrastructure installation documentation carefully. Additionally, review the following considerations before the installation:

Check the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Ecosystem to determine the level of Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) support provided for your chosen server hardware or virtualization technology.

Many virtualization and cloud environments require agents to be installed on guest operating systems. Ensure that these agents are installed as a containerized workload deployed through a daemon set.

Install cloud provider integration if you want to enable features such as dynamic storage, on-demand service routing, node hostname to Kubernetes hostname resolution, and cluster autoscaling.

A provider-specific Machine API implementation is required if you want to use machine sets or autoscaling to automatically provision Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster nodes.

Check whether your chosen cloud provider offers a method to inject Ignition configuration files into hosts as part of their initial deployment. If they do not, you will need to host Ignition configuration files by using an HTTP server. The steps taken to troubleshoot Ignition configuration file issues will differ depending on which of these two methods is deployed.

Storage needs to be manually provisioned if you want to leverage optional framework components such as the embedded container registry, Elasticsearch, or Prometheus. Default storage classes are not defined in user-provisioned infrastructure installations unless explicitly configured.

A load balancer is required to distribute API requests across all control plane nodes in highly available Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform environments. You can use any TCP-based load balancing solution that meets Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform DNS routing and port requirements.
Checking a load balancer configuration before Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation
Check your load balancer configuration prior to starting an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation.

You have configured an external load balancer of your choosing, in preparation for an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation. The following example is based on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) host using HAProxy to provide load balancing services to a cluster.

You have configured DNS in preparation for an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation.

You have SSH access to your load balancer.


Check that the haproxy systemd service is active:

Verify that the load balancer is listening on the required ports. The following example references ports 80, 443, 6443, and 22623.

Check that the wildcard DNS record resolves to the load balancer:
Specifying Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installer log levels
By default, the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installer log level is set to info. If more detailed logging is required when diagnosing a failed Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation, you can increase the openshift-install log level to debug when starting the installation again.

You have access to the installation host.


Set the installation log level to debug when initiating the installation:
Troubleshooting openshift-install command issues
If you experience issues running the openshift-install command, check the following:

The installation has been initiated within 24 hours of Ignition configuration file creation. The Ignition files are created when the following command is run:

The install-config.yaml file is in the same directory as the installer. If an alternative installation path is declared by using the ./openshift-install --dir option, verify that the install-config.yaml file exists within that directory.
Monitoring installation progress
You can monitor high-level installation, bootstrap, and control plane logs as an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation progresses. This provides greater visibility into how an installation progresses and helps identify the stage at which an installation failure occurs.

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You have SSH access to your hosts.

You have the fully qualified domain names of the bootstrap and control plane nodes.


Watch the installation log as the installation progresses:

Monitor the bootkube.service journald unit log on the bootstrap node, after it has booted. This provides visibility into the bootstrapping of the first control plane. Replace <bootstrap_fqdn> with the bootstrap node's fully qualified domain name:

Monitor kubelet.service journald unit logs on control plane nodes, after they have booted. This provides visibility into control plane node agent activity.

Monitor crio.service journald unit logs on control plane nodes, after they have booted. This provides visibility into control plane node CRI-O container runtime activity.
Gathering bootstrap node diagnostic data
When experiencing bootstrap-related issues, you can gather bootkube.service journald unit logs and container logs from the bootstrap node.
