Gathering data about your cluster

When opening a support case, it is helpful to provide debugging information about your cluster to Red Hat Support.

It is recommended to provide:

Data gathered using the oc adm must-gather command

The  unique cluster ID
About the must-gather tool
The oc adm must-gather CLI command collects the information from your cluster that is most likely needed for debugging issues, including:

Resource definitions

Service logs


By default, the oc adm must-gather command uses the default plugin image and writes into ./must-gather.local.

Alternatively, you can collect specific information by running the command with the appropriate arguments as described in the following sections:

To collect data related to one or more specific features, use the --image argument with an image, as listed in a following section.

To collect the audit logs, use the - /usr/bin/gather_audit_logs argument, as described in a following section.


When you run oc adm must-gather, a new pod with a random name is created in a new project on the cluster. The data is collected on that pod and saved in a new directory that starts with must-gather.local in the current working directory.

For example:

NAMESPACE                      NAME                 READY   STATUS      RESTARTS      AGE
...
openshift-must-gather-5drcj    must-gather-bklx4    2/2     Running     0             72s
openshift-must-gather-5drcj    must-gather-s8sdh    2/2     Running     0             72s
...
Optionally, you can run the oc adm must-gather command in a specific namespace by using the --run-namespace option.

For example:

$ oc adm must-gather --run-namespace <namespace> \
  --image=registry.redhat.io/container-native-virtualization/cnv-must-gather-rhel9:v4.14.0
Gathering data about your cluster for Red Hat Support
You can gather debugging information about your cluster by using the oc adm must-gather CLI command.

You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI (oc) is installed.


Navigate to the directory where you want to store the must-gather data.

Run the oc adm must-gather command:

Create a compressed file from the must-gather directory that was just created in your working directory. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux
operating system, run the following command:

Attach the compressed file to your support case on the the Customer Support page of the Red Hat Customer Portal.
Gathering data about specific features
You can gather debugging information about specific features by using the oc adm must-gather CLI command with the --image or --image-stream argument. The must-gather tool supports multiple images, so you can gather data about more than one feature by running a single command.


To determine the latest version for an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform component's image, see the OpenShift Operator Life Cycles web page on the Red Hat Customer Portal.
You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

Gathering network logs
You can gather network logs on all nodes in a cluster.

Run the oc adm must-gather command with - gather_network_logs:

Create a compressed file from the must-gather directory that was just created in your working directory. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

Attach the compressed file to your support case on the the Customer Support page of the Red Hat Customer Portal.
Changing the must-gather storage limit
When using the oc adm must-gather command to collect data the default maximum storage for the information is 30% of the storage capacity of the container. After the 30% limit is reached the container is killed and the gathering process stops. Information already gathered is downloaded to your local storage. To run the must-gather command again, you need either a container with more storage capacity or to adjust the maximum volume percentage.

If the container reaches the storage limit, an error message similar to the following example is generated.

Disk usage exceeds the volume percentage of 30% for mounted directory. Exiting...
You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

The OpenShift CLI (oc) is installed.


Run the oc adm must-gather command with the volume-percentage flag. The new value cannot exceed 100.
Obtaining your cluster ID
When providing information to Red Hat Support, it is helpful to provide the unique identifier for your cluster. You can have your cluster ID autofilled by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console. You can also manually obtain your cluster ID by using the web console or the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

You have access to the web console or the OpenShift CLI (oc) installed.


To manually obtain your cluster ID using the web console:

About sosreport
sosreport is a tool that collects configuration details, system information, and diagnostic data from Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) systems. sosreport provides a standardized way to collect diagnostic information relating to a node, which can then be provided to Red Hat Support for issue diagnosis.

In some support interactions, Red Hat Support may ask you to collect a sosreport archive for a specific Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform node. For example, it might sometimes be necessary to review system logs or other node-specific data that is not included within the output of oc adm must-gather.
Generating a sosreport archive for an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster node
The recommended way to generate a sosreport for an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15 cluster node is through a debug pod.

You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

You have SSH access to your hosts.

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You have a Red Hat standard or premium Subscription.

You have a Red Hat Customer Portal account.

You have an existing Red Hat Support case ID.


Obtain a list of cluster nodes:

Enter into a debug session on the target node. This step instantiates a debug pod called <node_name>-debug:

Set /host as the root directory within the debug shell. The debug pod mounts the host's root file system in /host within the pod. By changing the root directory to /host, you can run binaries contained in the host's executable paths:

Start a toolbox container, which includes the required binaries and plugins to run sosreport:

Collect a sosreport archive.

Provide the sosreport archive to Red Hat Support for analysis, using one of the following methods.
Querying bootstrap node journal logs
If you experience bootstrap-related issues, you can gather bootkube.service journald unit logs and container logs from the bootstrap node.

You have SSH access to your bootstrap node.

You have the fully qualified domain name of the bootstrap node.


Query bootkube.service journald unit logs from a bootstrap node during Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation. Replace <bootstrap_fqdn> with the bootstrap node's fully qualified domain name:

Collect logs from specific subdirectories under /var/log/ on cluster nodes.
Network trace methods
Collecting network traces, in the form of packet capture records, can assist Red Hat Support with troubleshooting network issues.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform supports two ways of performing a network trace. Review the following table and choose the method that meets your needs.
Collecting a host network trace
Sometimes, troubleshooting a network-related issue is simplified by tracing network communication and capturing packets on multiple nodes at the same time.

You can use a combination of the oc adm must-gather command and the registry.redhat.io/openshift4/network-tools-rhel8 container image to gather packet captures from nodes. Analyzing packet captures can help you troubleshoot network communication issues.

The oc adm must-gather command is used to run the tcpdump command in pods on specific nodes. The tcpdump command records the packet captures in the pods. When the tcpdump command exits, the oc adm must-gather command transfers the files with the packet captures from the pods to your client machine.

The sample command in the following procedure demonstrates performing a packet capture with the tcpdump command. However, you can run any command in the container image that is specified in the --image argument to gather troubleshooting information from multiple nodes at the same time.
You are logged in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform as a user with the cluster-admin role.

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).


Run a packet capture from the host network on some nodes by running the following command:

Perform the action, such as accessing a web application, that triggers the network communication issue while the network trace captures packets.

Review the packet capture files that oc adm must-gather transferred from the pods to your client machine:
Collecting a network trace from an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform node or container
When investigating potential network-related Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform issues, Red Hat Support might request a network packet trace from a specific Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster node or from a specific container. The recommended method to capture a network trace in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is through a debug pod.

About toolbox
toolbox is a tool that starts a container on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) system. The tool is primarily used to start a container that includes the required binaries and plugins that are needed to run commands such as sosreport and redhat-support-tool.

The primary purpose for a toolbox container is to gather diagnostic information and to provide it to Red Hat Support. However, if additional diagnostic tools are required, you can add RPM packages or run an image that is an alternative to the standard support tools image.


By default, running the toolbox command starts a container with the registry.redhat.io/rhel8/support-tools:latest image. This image contains the most frequently used support tools. If you need to collect node-specific data that requires a support tool that is not part of the image, you can install additional packages.

You have accessed a node with the oc debug node/<node_name> command.


Set /host as the root directory within the debug shell. The debug pod mounts the host's root file system in /host within the pod. By changing the root directory to /host, you can run binaries contained in the host's executable paths:

Start the toolbox container:

Install the additional package, such as wget:



By default, running the toolbox command starts a container with the registry.redhat.io/rhel8/support-tools:latest image. You can start an alternative image by creating a .toolboxrc file and specifying the image to run.

You have accessed a node with the oc debug node/<node_name> command.


Set /host as the root directory within the debug shell. The debug pod mounts the host's root file system in /host within the pod. By changing the root directory to /host, you can run binaries contained in the host's executable paths:
