Image configuration resources

Use the following procedure to configure image registries.
Image controller configuration parameters
The image.config.openshift.io/cluster resource holds cluster-wide information about how to handle images. The canonical, and only valid name is cluster. Its spec offers the following configuration parameters.

Parameters such as DisableScheduledImport, MaxImagesBulkImportedPerRepository, MaxScheduledImportsPerMinute, ScheduledImageImportMinimumIntervalSeconds, InternalRegistryHostname are not configurable.

When the allowedRegistries parameter is defined, all registries, including registry.redhat.io and quay.io registries and the default OpenShift image registry, are blocked unless explicitly listed. When using the parameter, to prevent pod failure, add all registries including the registry.redhat.io and quay.io registries and the internalRegistryHostname to the allowedRegistries list, as they are required by payload images within your environment. For disconnected clusters, mirror registries should also be added.
The status field of the image.config.openshift.io/cluster resource holds observed values from the cluster.
Configuring image registry settings
You can configure image registry settings by editing the image.config.openshift.io/cluster custom resource (CR). When changes to the registry are applied to the image.config.openshift.io/cluster CR, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) performs the following sequential actions:

Cordons the node

Applies changes by restarting CRI-O

Uncordons the node


Edit the image.config.openshift.io/cluster custom resource:

To check that the changes are applied, list your nodes:


Adding specific registries
You can add a list of registries, and optionally an individual repository within a registry, that are permitted for image pull and push actions by editing the image.config.openshift.io/cluster custom resource (CR). "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" applies the changes to this CR to all nodes in the cluster.

When pulling or pushing images, the container runtime searches the registries listed under the registrySources parameter in the image.config.openshift.io/cluster CR. If you created a list of registries under the allowedRegistries parameter, the container runtime searches only those registries. Registries not in the list are blocked.

When the allowedRegistries parameter is defined, all registries, including the registry.redhat.io and quay.io registries and the default OpenShift image registry, are blocked unless explicitly listed. If you use the parameter, to prevent pod failure, add the registry.redhat.io and quay.io registries and the internalRegistryHostname to the allowedRegistries list, as they are required by payload images within your environment. For disconnected clusters, mirror registries should also be added.
Edit the image.config.openshift.io/cluster custom resource:


Enter the following command to obtain a list of your nodes:


If your cluster uses the registrySources.insecureRegistries parameter, ensure that any insecure registries are included in the allowed list.

For example:

spec:
  registrySources:
    insecureRegistries:
    - insecure.com
    allowedRegistries:
    - example.com
    - quay.io
    - registry.redhat.io
    - insecure.com
    - image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000
Blocking specific registries
You can block any registry, and optionally an individual repository within a registry, by editing the image.config.openshift.io/cluster custom resource (CR). "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" applies the changes to this CR to all nodes in the cluster.

When pulling or pushing images, the container runtime searches the registries listed under the registrySources parameter in the image.config.openshift.io/cluster CR. If you created a list of registries under the blockedRegistries parameter, the container runtime does not search those registries. All other registries are allowed.

To prevent pod failure, do not add the registry.redhat.io and quay.io registries to the blockedRegistries list, as they are required by payload images within your environment.
Edit the image.config.openshift.io/cluster custom resource:


Enter the following command to obtain a list of your nodes:


Blocking a payload registry
In a mirroring configuration, you can block upstream payload registries in a disconnected environment using a ImageContentSourcePolicy (ICSP) object. The following example procedure demonstrates how to block the quay.io/openshift-payload payload registry.

Create the mirror configuration using an ImageContentSourcePolicy (ICSP) object to mirror the payload to a registry in your instance. The following example ICSP file mirrors the payload internal-mirror.io/openshift-payload:

After the object deploys onto your nodes, verify that the mirror configuration is set by checking the /etc/containers/registries.conf file:

Use the following command to edit the image.config.openshift.io custom resource file:

To block the payload registry, add the following configuration to the image.config.openshift.io custom resource file:


Verify that the upstream payload registry is blocked by checking the /etc/containers/registries.conf file on the node.
Allowing insecure registries
You can add insecure registries, and optionally an individual repository within a registry, by editing the image.config.openshift.io/cluster custom resource (CR). "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" applies the changes to this CR to all nodes in the cluster.

Registries that do not use valid SSL certificates or do not require HTTPS connections are considered insecure.

Insecure external registries should be avoided to reduce possible security risks.
Edit the image.config.openshift.io/cluster custom resource:


To check that the registries have been added to the policy file, use the following command on a node:
Adding registries that allow image short names
You can add registries to search for an image short name by editing the image.config.openshift.io/cluster custom resource (CR). "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" applies the changes to this CR to all nodes in the cluster.

An image short name enables you to search for images without including the fully qualified domain name in the pull spec. For example, you could use rhel7/etcd instead of registry.access.redhat.com/rhe7/etcd.

You might use short names in situations where using the full path is not practical. For example, if your cluster references multiple internal registries whose DNS changes frequently, you would need to update the fully qualified domain names in your pull specs with each change. In this case, using an image short name might be beneficial.

When pulling or pushing images, the container runtime searches the registries listed under the registrySources parameter in the image.config.openshift.io/cluster CR. If you created a list of registries under the containerRuntimeSearchRegistries parameter, when pulling an image with a short name, the container runtime searches those registries.

Using image short names with public registries is strongly discouraged because the image might not deploy if the public registry requires authentication. Use fully-qualified image names with public registries.

Red Hat internal or private registries typically support the use of image short names.

If you list public registries under the containerRuntimeSearchRegistries parameter (including the registry.redhat.io, docker.io, and quay.io registries), you expose your credentials to all the registries on the list, and you risk network and registry attacks. Because you can only have one pull secret for pulling images, as defined by the global pull secret, that secret is used to authenticate against every registry in that list. Therefore, if you include public registries in the list, you introduce a security risk.

You cannot list multiple public registries under the containerRuntimeSearchRegistries parameter if each public registry requires different credentials and a cluster does not list the public registry in the global pull secret.

For a public registry that requires authentication, you can use an image short name only if the registry has its credentials stored in the global pull secret.
The Machine Config Operator (MCO) watches the image.config.openshift.io/cluster resource for any changes to the registries. When the MCO detects a change, it drains the nodes, applies the change, and uncordons the nodes. After the nodes return to the Ready state, if the containerRuntimeSearchRegistries parameter is added, the MCO creates a file in the /etc/containers/registries.conf.d directory on each node with the listed registries. The file overrides the default list of unqualified search registries in the /etc/containers/registries.conf file. There is no way to fall back to the default list of unqualified search registries.

The containerRuntimeSearchRegistries parameter works only with the Podman and CRI-O container engines. The registries in the list can be used only in pod specs, not in builds and image streams.

Edit the image.config.openshift.io/cluster custom resource:


Enter the following command to obtain a list of your nodes:
Configuring additional trust stores for image registry access
The image.config.openshift.io/cluster custom resource can contain a reference to a config map that contains additional certificate authorities to be trusted during image registry access.

The certificate authorities (CA) must be PEM-encoded.


You can create a config map in the openshift-config namespace and use its name in AdditionalTrustedCA in the image.config.openshift.io custom resource to provide additional CAs that should be trusted when contacting external registries.

The config map key is the hostname of a registry with the port for which this CA is to be trusted, and the PEM certificate content is the value, for each additional registry CA to trust.

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-registry-ca
data:
  registry.example.com: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    ...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
  registry-with-port.example.com..5000: | 1
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    ...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
If the registry has the port, such as registry-with-port.example.com:5000, : should be replaced with &#8230;&#8203;


You can configure additional CAs with the following procedure.

To configure an additional CA:
Understanding image registry repository mirroring
Setting up container registry repository mirroring enables you to perform the following tasks:

Configure your "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster to redirect requests to pull images from a repository on a source image registry and have it resolved by a repository on a mirrored image registry.

Identify multiple mirrored repositories for each target repository, to make sure that if one mirror is down, another can be used.


Repository mirroring in "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" includes the following attributes:

Image pulls are resilient to registry downtimes.

Clusters in disconnected environments can pull images from critical locations, such as quay.io, and have registries behind a company firewall provide the requested images.

A particular order of registries is tried when an image pull request is made, with the permanent registry typically being the last one tried.

The mirror information you enter is added to the /etc/containers/registries.conf file on every node in the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster.

When a node makes a request for an image from the source repository, it tries each mirrored repository in turn until it finds the requested content. If all mirrors fail, the cluster tries the source repository. If successful, the image is pulled to the node.


Setting up repository mirroring can be done in the following ways:

At "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation:

After "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation:


Each of these custom resource objects identify the following information:

The source of the container image repository you want to mirror.

A separate entry for each mirror repository you want to offer the content
requested from the source repository.
For new clusters, you can use IDMS, ITMS, and ICSP CRs objects as desired. However, using IDMS and ITMS is recommended.

If you upgraded a cluster, any existing ICSP objects remain stable, and both IDMS and ICSP objects are supported. Workloads using ICSP objects continue to function as expected. However, if you want to take advantage of the fallback policies introduced in the IDMS CRs, you can migrate current workloads to IDMS objects by using the oc adm migrate icsp command as shown in the Converting ImageContentSourcePolicy (ICSP) files for image registry repository mirroring section that follows. Migrating to IDMS objects does not require a cluster reboot.

If your cluster uses an ImageDigestMirrorSet, ImageTagMirrorSet, or ImageContentSourcePolicy object to configure repository mirroring, you can use only global pull secrets for mirrored registries. You cannot add a pull secret to a project.
For more information about global pull secrets, see Updating the global cluster pull secret.


Configuring image registry repository mirroring
You can create postinstallation mirror configuration custom resources (CR) to redirect image pull requests from a source image registry to a mirrored image registry.

Access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.


Configure mirrored repositories, by either:

Log in to your "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster.

Create a postinstallation mirror configuration CR, by using one of the following examples:

Create the new object:

To check that the mirrored configuration settings are applied, do the following on one of the nodes.


If the repository mirroring procedure does not work as described, use the following information about how repository mirroring works to help troubleshoot the problem.

The first working mirror is used to supply the pulled image.

The main registry is only used if no other mirror works.

From the system context, the Insecure flags are used as fallback.

The format of the /etc/containers/registries.conf file has changed recently. It is now version 2 and in TOML format.
Converting ImageContentSourcePolicy (ICSP) files for image registry repository mirroring
Using an ImageContentSourcePolicy (ICSP) object to configure repository mirroring is a deprecated feature. This functionality is still included in "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" and continues to be supported; however, it will be removed in a future release of this product and is not recommended for new deployments.

ICSP objects are being replaced by ImageDigestMirrorSet and ImageTagMirrorSet objects to configure repository mirroring. If you have existing YAML files that you used to create ImageContentSourcePolicy objects, you can use the oc adm migrate icsp command to convert those files to an ImageDigestMirrorSet YAML file. The command updates the API to the current version, changes the kind value to ImageDigestMirrorSet, and changes spec.repositoryDigestMirrors to spec.imageDigestMirrors. The rest of the file is not changed.

Because the migration does not change the registries.conf file, the cluster does not need to reboot.

For more information about ImageDigestMirrorSet or ImageTagMirrorSet objects, see "Configuring image registry repository mirroring" in the previous section.

Access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

Ensure that you have ImageContentSourcePolicy objects on your cluster.


Use the following command to convert one or more ImageContentSourcePolicy YAML files to an ImageDigestMirrorSet YAML file:

Create the CR object by running the following command:

Remove the ICSP objects after the IDMS objects are rolled out.
