Managing images overview

With Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform you can interact with images and set up image streams, depending on where the registries of the images are located, any authentication requirements around those registries, and how you want your builds and deployments to behave.
Images overview
An image stream comprises any number of container images identified by tags. It presents a single virtual view of related images, similar to a container image repository.

By watching an image stream, builds and deployments can receive notifications when new images are added or modified and react by performing a build or deployment, respectively.
