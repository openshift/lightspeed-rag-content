Image pull policy

Each container in a pod has a container image. After you have created an image and pushed it to a registry, you can then refer to it in the pod.
Image pull policy overview
When Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform creates containers, it uses the container imagePullPolicy to determine if the image should be pulled prior to starting the container. There are three possible values for imagePullPolicy:


If a container imagePullPolicy parameter is not specified, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform sets it based on the image tag:

If the tag is latest, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform defaults imagePullPolicy to Always.

Otherwise, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform defaults imagePullPolicy to IfNotPresent.
