Triggering and modifying builds

The following sections outline how to trigger builds and modify builds using build hooks.
Build triggers
When defining a BuildConfig, you can define triggers to control the circumstances in which the BuildConfig should be run. The following build triggers are available:

Webhook

Image change

Configuration change


Webhook triggers
Webhook triggers allow you to trigger a new build by sending a request to the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" API endpoint. You can define these triggers using GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Generic webhooks.

Currently, "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" webhooks only support the analogous versions of the push event for each of the Git-based Source Code Management (SCM) systems. All other event types are ignored.

When the push events are processed, the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" control plane host confirms if the branch reference inside the event matches the branch reference in the corresponding BuildConfig. If so, it then checks out the exact commit reference noted in the webhook event on the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" build. If they do not match, no build is triggered.

oc new-app and oc new-build create GitHub and Generic webhook triggers automatically, but any other needed webhook triggers must be added manually. You can manually add triggers by setting triggers.
For all webhooks, you must define a secret with a key named WebHookSecretKey and the value being the value to be supplied when invoking the webhook. The webhook definition must then reference the secret. The secret ensures the uniqueness of the URL, preventing others from triggering the build. The value of the key is compared to the secret provided during the webhook invocation.

For example here is a GitHub webhook with a reference to a secret named mysecret:

type: "GitHub"
github:
  secretReference:
    name: "mysecret"
The secret is then defined as follows. Note that the value of the secret is base64 encoded as is required for any data field of a Secret object.

- kind: Secret
  apiVersion: v1
  metadata:
    name: mysecret
    creationTimestamp:
  data:
    WebHookSecretKey: c2VjcmV0dmFsdWUx
Using GitHub webhooks
GitHub webhooks handle the call made by GitHub when a repository is updated. When defining the trigger, you must specify a secret, which is part of the URL you supply to GitHub when configuring the webhook.

Example GitHub webhook definition:

type: "GitHub"
github:
  secretReference:
    name: "mysecret"
The secret used in the webhook trigger configuration is not the same as secret field you encounter when configuring webhook in GitHub UI. The former is to make the webhook URL unique and hard to predict, the latter is an optional string field used to create HMAC hex digest of the body, which is sent as an X-Hub-Signature header.
The payload URL is returned as the GitHub Webhook URL by the oc describe command (see Displaying Webhook URLs), and is structured as follows:

https://<openshift_api_host:port>/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/github
Create a BuildConfig from a GitHub repository.


To configure a GitHub Webhook:

Given a file containing a valid JSON payload, such as payload.json, you can manually trigger the webhook with curl:


The build will only be triggered if the ref value from GitHub webhook event matches the ref value specified in the source.git field of the BuildConfig resource.
Gogs
Using GitLab webhooks
GitLab webhooks handle the call made by GitLab when a repository is updated. As with the GitHub triggers, you must specify a secret. The following example is a trigger definition YAML within the BuildConfig:

type: "GitLab"
gitlab:
  secretReference:
    name: "mysecret"
The payload URL is returned as the GitLab Webhook URL by the oc describe command, and is structured as follows:

https://<openshift_api_host:port>/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/gitlab
To configure a GitLab Webhook:

Given a file containing a valid JSON payload, such as payload.json, you can
manually trigger the webhook with curl:
Using Bitbucket webhooks
Bitbucket webhooks handle the call made by Bitbucket when a repository is updated. Similar to the previous triggers, you must specify a secret. The following example is a trigger definition YAML within the BuildConfig:

type: "Bitbucket"
bitbucket:
  secretReference:
    name: "mysecret"
The payload URL is returned as the Bitbucket Webhook URL by the oc describe command, and is structured as follows:

https://<openshift_api_host:port>/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/bitbucket
To configure a Bitbucket Webhook:

Given a file containing a valid JSON payload, such as payload.json, you can
manually trigger the webhook with curl:
Using generic webhooks
Generic webhooks are invoked from any system capable of making a web request. As with the other webhooks, you must specify a secret, which is part of the URL that the caller must use to trigger the build. The secret ensures the uniqueness of the URL, preventing others from triggering the build. The following is an example trigger definition YAML within the BuildConfig:

type: "Generic"
generic:
  secretReference:
    name: "mysecret"
  allowEnv: true 1
Set to true to allow a generic webhook to pass in environment variables.


To set up the caller, supply the calling system with the URL of the generic
webhook endpoint for your build:

To invoke the webhook manually you can use curl:

To pass this payload using curl, define it in a file named payload_file.yaml and run:


"Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" permits builds to be triggered by the generic webhook even if an invalid request payload is presented, for example, invalid content type, unparsable or invalid content, and so on. This behavior is maintained for backwards compatibility. If an invalid request payload is presented, "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" returns a warning in JSON format as part of its HTTP 200 OK response.
Displaying webhook URLs
You can use the following command to display webhook URLs associated with a build configuration. If the command does not display any webhook URLs, then no webhook trigger is defined for that build configuration.

To display any webhook URLs associated with a BuildConfig, run:


$ oc describe bc <name>
Using image change triggers
As a developer, you can configure your build to run automatically every time a base image changes.

You can use image change triggers to automatically invoke your build when a new version of an upstream image is available. For example, if a build is based on a RHEL image, you can trigger that build to run any time the RHEL image changes. As a result, the application image is always running on the latest RHEL base image.

Image streams that point to container images in v1 container registries only trigger a build once when the image stream tag becomes available and not on subsequent image updates. This is due to the lack of uniquely identifiable images in v1 container registries.
Define an ImageStream that points to the upstream image you want to use as a trigger:

If an image stream is the base image for the build, set the from field in the build strategy to point to the ImageStream:

Define a build with one or more triggers that point to ImageStreams:


When using an image change trigger for the strategy image stream, the generated build is supplied with an immutable docker tag that points to the latest image corresponding to that tag. This new image reference is used by the strategy when it executes for the build.

For other image change triggers that do not reference the strategy image stream, a new build is started, but the build strategy is not updated with a unique image reference.

Since this example has an image change trigger for the strategy, the resulting build is:

strategy:
  sourceStrategy:
    from:
      kind: "DockerImage"
      name: "172.30.17.3:5001/mynamespace/ruby-20-centos7:<immutableid>"
This ensures that the triggered build uses the new image that was just pushed to the repository, and the build can be re-run any time with the same inputs.

You can pause an image change trigger to allow multiple changes on the referenced image stream before a build is started. You can also set the paused attribute to true when initially adding an ImageChangeTrigger to a BuildConfig to prevent a build from being immediately triggered.

type: "ImageChange"
imageChange:
  from:
    kind: "ImageStreamTag"
    name: "custom-image:latest"
  paused: true
If a build is triggered due to a webhook trigger or manual request, the build that is created uses the <immutableid> resolved from the ImageStream referenced by the Strategy. This ensures that builds are performed using consistent image tags for ease of reproduction.

Identifying the image change trigger of a build
As a developer, if you have image change triggers, you can identify which image change initiated the last build. This can be useful for debugging or troubleshooting builds.

apiVersion: build.openshift.io/v1
kind: BuildConfig
metadata:
  name: bc-ict-example
  namespace: bc-ict-example-namespace
spec:

# ...

  triggers:
  - imageChange:
      from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: input:latest
        namespace: bc-ict-example-namespace
  - imageChange:
      from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: input2:latest
        namespace: bc-ict-example-namespace
    type: ImageChange
status:
  imageChangeTriggers:
  - from:
      name: input:latest
      namespace: bc-ict-example-namespace
    lastTriggerTime: "2021-06-30T13:47:53Z"
    lastTriggeredImageID: image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/bc-ict-example-namespace/input@sha256:0f88ffbeb9d25525720bfa3524cb1bf0908b7f791057cf1acfae917b11266a69
  - from:
      name: input2:latest
      namespace: bc-ict-example-namespace
    lastTriggeredImageID:  image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/bc-ict-example-namespace/input2@sha256:0f88ffbeb9d25525720bfa3524cb2ce0908b7f791057cf1acfae917b11266a69

  lastVersion: 1
This example omits elements that are not related to image change triggers.
You have configured multiple image change triggers. These triggers have triggered one or more builds.


In buildConfig.status.imageChangeTriggers to identify the lastTriggerTime that has the latest timestamp.

Under imageChangeTriggers, compare  timestamps to identify the latest


In your build configuration, buildConfig.spec.triggers is an array of build trigger policies, BuildTriggerPolicy.

Each BuildTriggerPolicy has a type field and set of pointers fields. Each pointer field corresponds to one of the allowed values for the type field. As such, you can only set BuildTriggerPolicy to only one pointer field.

For image change triggers, the value of type is ImageChange. Then, the imageChange field is the pointer to an ImageChangeTrigger object, which has the following fields:

lastTriggeredImageID: This field, which is not shown in the example, is deprecated in "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" 4.8 and will be ignored in a future release. It contains the resolved image reference for the ImageStreamTag when the last build was triggered from this BuildConfig.

paused: You can use this field, which is not shown in the example, to temporarily disable this particular image change trigger.

from: You use this field to reference the ImageStreamTag that drives this image change trigger. Its type is the core Kubernetes type, OwnerReference.


The from field has the following fields of note:  kind: For image change triggers, the only supported value is ImageStreamTag. namespace: You use this field to specify the namespace of the ImageStreamTag. ** name: You use this field to specify the ImageStreamTag.

In your build configuration, buildConfig.status.imageChangeTriggers is an array of ImageChangeTriggerStatus elements. Each ImageChangeTriggerStatus element includes the from, lastTriggeredImageID, and lastTriggerTime elements shown in the preceding example.

The ImageChangeTriggerStatus that has the most recent lastTriggerTime triggered the most recent build. You use its name and namespace to identify the image change trigger in buildConfig.spec.triggers that triggered the build.

The lastTriggerTime with the most recent timestamp signifies the ImageChangeTriggerStatus of the last build. This ImageChangeTriggerStatus has the same name and namespace as the image change trigger in buildConfig.spec.triggers that triggered the build.

v1 container registries
Configuration change triggers
A configuration change trigger allows a build to be automatically invoked as soon as a new BuildConfig is created.

The following is an example trigger definition YAML within the BuildConfig:

  type: "ConfigChange"
Configuration change triggers currently only work when creating a new BuildConfig. In a future release, configuration change triggers will also be able to launch a build whenever a BuildConfig is updated.
Setting triggers manually
Triggers can be added to and removed from build configurations with oc set triggers.

To set a GitHub webhook trigger on a build configuration, use:

To set an imagechange trigger, use:

To remove a trigger, add --remove:


When a webhook trigger already exists, adding it again regenerates the webhook secret.
For more information, consult the help documentation with by running:

$ oc set triggers --help
Build hooks
Build hooks allow behavior to be injected into the build process.

The postCommit field of a BuildConfig object runs commands inside a temporary container that is running the build output image. The hook is run immediately after the last layer of the image has been committed and before the image is pushed to a registry.

The current working directory is set to the image's WORKDIR, which is the default working directory of the container image. For most images, this is where the source code is located.

The hook fails if the script or command returns a non-zero exit code or if starting the temporary container fails. When the hook fails it marks the build as failed and the image is not pushed to a registry. The reason for failing can be inspected by looking at the build logs.

Build hooks can be used to run unit tests to verify the image before the build is marked complete and the image is made available in a registry. If all tests pass and the test runner returns with exit code 0, the build is marked successful. In case of any test failure, the build is marked as failed. In all cases, the build log contains the output of the test runner, which can be used to identify failed tests.

The postCommit hook is not only limited to running tests, but can be used for other commands as well. Since it runs in a temporary container, changes made by the hook do not persist, meaning that running the hook cannot affect the final image. This behavior allows for, among other uses, the installation and usage of test dependencies that are automatically discarded and are not present in the final image.

Configuring post commit build hooks
There are different ways to configure the post build hook. All forms in the following examples are equivalent and run bundle exec rake test --verbose.

Shell script:

Command as the image entry point:

Command with arguments:


Providing both script and command simultaneously creates an invalid build hook.
Using the CLI to set post commit build hooks
The oc set build-hook command can be used to set the build hook for a build configuration.

To set a command as the post-commit build hook:
