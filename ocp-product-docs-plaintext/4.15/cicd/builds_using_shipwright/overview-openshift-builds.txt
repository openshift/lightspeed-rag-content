Overview of Builds

Builds is an extensible build framework based on the Shipwright project, which you can use to build container images on an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. You can build container images from source code and Dockerfiles by using image build tools, such as Source-to-Image (S2I) and Buildah. You can create and apply build resources, view logs of build runs, and manage builds in your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform namespaces.

Builds includes the following capabilities:

Standard Kubernetes-native API for building container images from source code and Dockerfiles

Support for Source-to-Image (S2I) and Buildah build strategies

Extensibility with your own custom build strategies

Execution of builds from source code in a local directory

Shipwright CLI for creating and viewing logs, and managing builds on the cluster

Integrated user experience with the Developer perspective of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console


Builds consists of the following custom resources (CRs):
