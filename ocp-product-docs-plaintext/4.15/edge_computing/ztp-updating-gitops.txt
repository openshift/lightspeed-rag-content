Updating GitOps ZTP

You can update the GitOps Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) infrastructure independently from the hub cluster, Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM), and the managed "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" clusters.

You can update the Red Hat OpenShift GitOps Operator when new versions become available. When updating the GitOps ZTP plugin, review the updated files in the reference configuration and ensure that the changes meet your requirements.
Overview of the GitOps ZTP update process
You can update GitOps Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) for a fully operational hub cluster running an earlier version of the GitOps ZTP infrastructure. The update process avoids impact on managed clusters.

Any changes to policy settings, including adding recommended content, results in updated polices that must be rolled out to the managed clusters and reconciled.
At a high level, the strategy for updating the GitOps ZTP infrastructure is as follows:

Label all existing clusters with the ztp-done label.

Stop the ArgoCD applications.

Install the new GitOps ZTP tools.

Update required content and optional changes in the Git repository.

Update and restart the application configuration.
Preparing for the upgrade
Use the following procedure to prepare your site for the GitOps Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) upgrade.

Get the latest version of the GitOps ZTP container that has the custom resources (CRs) used to configure Red Hat OpenShift GitOps for use with GitOps ZTP.

Extract the argocd/deployment directory by using the following commands:

Update the clusters-app.yaml and policies-app.yaml files to reflect the name of your applications and the URL, branch, and path for your Git repository.

Diff the changes between the configuration and deployment source CRs in the /update folder and Git repo where you manage your fleet site CRs. Apply and push the required changes to your site repository.
Labeling the existing clusters
To ensure that existing clusters remain untouched by the tool updates, label all existing managed clusters with the ztp-done label.

This procedure only applies when updating clusters that were not provisioned with Topology Aware Lifecycle Manager (TALM). Clusters that you provision with TALM are automatically labeled with ztp-done.
Find a label selector that lists the managed clusters that were deployed with GitOps Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP), such as local-cluster!=true:

Ensure that the resulting list contains all the managed clusters that were deployed with GitOps ZTP, and then use that selector to add the ztp-done label:
Stopping the existing GitOps ZTP applications
Removing the existing applications ensures that any changes to existing content in the Git repository are not rolled out until the new version of the tools is available.

Use the application files from the deployment directory. If you used custom names for the applications, update the names in these files first.

Perform a non-cascaded delete on the clusters application to leave all generated resources in place:

Perform a cascaded delete on the policies application to remove all previous policies:
Required changes to the Git repository
When upgrading the ztp-site-generate container from an earlier release of GitOps Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) to 4.10 or later, there are additional requirements for the contents of the Git repository. Existing content in the repository must be updated to reflect these changes.

Make required changes to PolicyGenTemplate files:

Add the kustomization.yaml file to the repository:

Remove the pre-sync.yaml and post-sync.yaml files.

Review and incorporate recommended changes
Installing the new GitOps ZTP applications
Using the extracted argocd/deployment directory, and after ensuring that the applications point to your site Git repository, apply the full contents of the deployment directory. Applying the full contents of the directory ensures that all necessary resources for the applications are correctly configured.

To install the GitOps ZTP plugin, patch the ArgoCD instance in the hub cluster by using the patch file that you previously extracted into the out/argocd/deployment/ directory.
Run the following command:

In RHACM 2.7 and later, the multicluster engine enables the cluster-proxy-addon feature by default.
Apply the following patch to disable the cluster-proxy-addon feature and remove the relevant hub cluster and managed pods that are responsible for this add-on.
Run the following command:

Apply the pipeline configuration to your hub cluster by running the following command:
Rolling out the GitOps ZTP configuration changes
If any configuration changes were included in the upgrade due to implementing recommended changes, the upgrade process results in a set of policy CRs on the hub cluster in the Non-Compliant state. With the GitOps Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) version 4.10 and later ztp-site-generate container, these policies are set to inform mode and are not pushed to the managed clusters without an additional step by the user. This ensures that potentially disruptive changes to the clusters can be managed in terms of when the changes are made, for example, during a maintenance window, and how many clusters are updated concurrently.

To roll out the changes, create one or more ClusterGroupUpgrade CRs as detailed in the TALM documentation. The CR must contain the list of Non-Compliant policies that you want to push out to the managed clusters as well as a list or selector of which clusters should be included in the update.
