"Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" overview

"Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" is a cloud-based Kubernetes container platform. The foundation of "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" is based on Kubernetes and therefore shares the same technology. It is designed to allow applications and the data centers that support them to expand from just a few machines and applications to thousands of machines that serve millions of clients.

"Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" enables you to do the following:

Provide developers and IT organizations with cloud application platforms that can be used for deploying applications on secure and scalable resources.

Require minimal configuration and management overhead.

Bring the Kubernetes platform to customer data centers and cloud.

With its foundation in Kubernetes, "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" incorporates the same technology that serves as the engine for massive telecommunications, streaming video, gaming, banking, and other applications. Its implementation in open Red Hat technologies lets you extend your containerized applications beyond a single cloud to on-premise and multi-cloud environments.
Glossary of common terms for "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform"
This glossary defines common Kubernetes and "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" terms.


Kubernetes
Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration engine for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
Containers
Containers are application instances and components that run in OCI-compliant containers on the worker nodes. A container is the runtime of an Open Container Initiative (OCI)-compliant image. An image is a binary application. A worker node can run many containers. A node capacity is related to memory and CPU capabilities of the underlying resources whether they are cloud, hardware, or virtualized.
Pod
A pod is one or more containers deployed together on one host. It consists of a colocated group of containers with shared resources such as volumes and IP addresses. A pod is also the smallest compute unit defined, deployed, and managed.
Replica set and replication controller
The Kubernetes replica set and the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" replication controller are both available. The job of this component is to ensure the specified number of pod replicas are running at all times. If pods exit or are deleted, the replica set or replication controller starts more. If more pods are running than needed, the replica set deletes as many as necessary to match the specified number of replicas.
Deployment and DeploymentConfig
"Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" implements both Kubernetes Deployment objects and "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" DeploymentConfigs objects. Users may select either.
Service
A service defines a logical set of pods and access policies. It provides permanent internal IP addresses and hostnames for other applications to use as pods are created and destroyed.
Route
A route is a way to expose a service by giving it an externally reachable hostname, such as www.example.com. Each route consists of a route name, a service selector, and optionally a security configuration. A router can consume a defined route and the endpoints identified by its service to provide a name that lets external clients reach your applications.  While it is easy to deploy a complete multi-tier application, traffic from anywhere outside the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" environment cannot reach the application without the routing layer.
Build
A build is the process of transforming input parameters into a resulting object. Most often, the process is used to transform input parameters or source code into a runnable image. A BuildConfig object is the definition of the entire build process. "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" leverages Kubernetes by creating containers from build images and pushing them to the integrated registry.
Project
"Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" uses projects to allow groups of users or developers to work together, serving as the unit of isolation and collaboration. It defines the scope of resources, allows project administrators and collaborators to manage resources, and restricts and tracks the user’s resources with quotas and limits.
Operators
An Operator is a Kubernetes-native application. The goal of an Operator is to put operational knowledge into software. Previously this knowledge only resided in the minds of administrators, various combinations or shell scripts or automation software such as Ansible. It was outside your Kubernetes cluster and hard to integrate. With Operators, all of this changes.
Understanding "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform"
"Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" is a Kubernetes environment for managing the lifecycle of container-based applications and their dependencies on various computing platforms, such as bare metal, virtualized, on-premise, and in cloud. "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" deploys, configures and manages containers. "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" offers usability, stability, and customization of its components.

"Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" utilises a number of computing resources, known as nodes. A node has a lightweight, secure operating system based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), known as Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS).

After a node is booted and configured, it obtains a container runtime, such as CRI-O or Docker, for managing and running the images of container workloads scheduled to it. The Kubernetes agent, or kubelet schedules container workloads on the node. The kubelet is responsible for registering the node with the cluster and receiving the details of container workloads.

"Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" configures and manages the networking, load balancing and routing of the cluster. "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" adds cluster services for monitoring the cluster health and performance, logging, and for managing upgrades.

The container image registry and OperatorHub provide Red Hat certified products and community built softwares for providing various application services within the cluster. These applications and services manage the applications deployed in the cluster, databases, frontends and user interfaces, application runtimes and business automation, and developer services for development and testing of container applications.

You can manage applications within the cluster either manually by configuring deployments of containers running from pre-built images or through resources known as Operators. You can build custom images from pre-build images and source code, and store these custom images locally in an internal, private or public registry.

The Multicluster Management layer can manage multiple clusters including their deployment, configuration, compliance and distribution of workloads in a single console.
Installing "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform"
The "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation program offers you flexibility. You can use the installation program to deploy a cluster on infrastructure that the installation program provisions and the cluster maintains or deploy a cluster on infrastructure that you prepare and maintain.

For more information about the installation process, the supported platforms, and choosing a method of installing and preparing your cluster, see the following:

OpenShift Local overview
OpenShift Local supports rapid application development to get started building "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" clusters. OpenShift Local is designed to run on a local computer to simplify setup and testing, and to emulate the cloud development environment locally with all of the tools needed to develop container-based applications.

Regardless of the programming language you use, OpenShift Local hosts your application and brings a minimal, preconfigured Red Hat "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster to your local PC without the need for a server-based infrastructure.

On a hosted environment, OpenShift Local can create microservices, convert them into images, and run them in Kubernetes-hosted containers directly on your laptop or desktop running Linux, macOS, or Windows 10 or later.
