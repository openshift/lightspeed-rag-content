Creating quick start tutorials in the web console

If you are creating quick start tutorials for the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, follow these guidelines to maintain a consistent user experience across all quick starts.
Understanding quick starts
A quick start is a guided tutorial with user tasks. In the web console, you can access quick starts under the Help menu. They are especially useful for getting oriented with an application, Operator, or other product offering.

A quick start primarily consists of tasks and steps. Each task has multiple steps, and each quick start has multiple tasks. For example:

Task 1

Task 2

Task 3
Quick start user workflow
When you interact with an existing quick start tutorial, this is the expected workflow experience:

In the Administrator or Developer perspective, click the Help icon and select Quick Starts.

Click a quick start card.

In the panel that appears, click Start.

Complete the on-screen instructions, then click Next.

In the Check your work module that appears, answer the question to confirm that you successfully completed the task.

Repeat steps 1 through 6 above to complete the remaining tasks in the quick start.

After completing the final task, click Close to close the quick start.
Quick start components
A quick start consists of the following sections:

Card: The catalog tile that provides the basic information of the quick start, including title, description, time commitment, and completion status

Introduction: A brief overview of the goal and tasks of the quick start

Task headings: Hyper-linked titles for each task in the quick start

Check your work module: A module for a user to confirm that they completed a task successfully before advancing to the next task in the quick start

Hints: An animation to help users identify specific areas of the product

Buttons


The main content area of a quick start includes the following sections:

Contributing quick starts
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform introduces the quick start custom resource, which is defined by a ConsoleQuickStart object. Operators and administrators can use this resource to contribute quick starts to the cluster.

You must have cluster administrator privileges.


To create a new quick start, run:

Run:

Update the YAML file using the guidance outlined in this documentation.

Save your edits.

  introduction: >- 1
    **Spring** is a Java framework for building applications based on a distributed microservices architecture.

    - Spring enables easy packaging and configuration of Spring applications into a self-contained executable application which can be easily deployed as a container to OpenShift.

    - Spring applications can integrate OpenShift capabilities to provide a natural "Spring on OpenShift" developer experience for both existing and net-new Spring applications. For example:

    - Externalized configuration using Kubernetes ConfigMaps and integration with Spring Cloud Kubernetes

    - Service discovery using Kubernetes Services

    - Load balancing with Replication Controllers

    - Kubernetes health probes and integration with Spring Actuator

    - Metrics: Prometheus, Grafana, and integration with Spring Cloud Sleuth

    - Distributed tracing with Istio & Jaeger tracing

    - Developer tooling through Red Hat OpenShift and Red Hat CodeReady developer tooling to quickly scaffold new Spring projects, gain access to familiar Spring APIs in your favorite IDE, and deploy to Red Hat OpenShift
...
The introduction introduces the quick start and lists the tasks within it.


After clicking a quick start card, a side panel slides in that introduces the quick start and lists the tasks within it.
Adding a custom icon to a quick start
A default icon is provided for all quick starts. You can provide your own custom icon.

Find the .svg file that you want to use as your custom icon.

Use an online tool to convert the text to base64.

In the YAML file, add icon: >-, then on the next line include data:image/svg+xml;base64 followed by the output from the base64 conversion. For example:
Limiting access to a quick start
Not all quick starts should be available for everyone. The accessReviewResources section of the YAML file provides the ability to limit access to the quick start.

To only allow the user to access the quick start if they have the ability to create HelmChartRepository resources, use the following configuration:

accessReviewResources:
  - group: helm.openshift.io
    resource: helmchartrepositories
    verb: create
To only allow the user to access the quick start if they have the ability to list Operator groups and package manifests, thus ability to install Operators, use the following configuration:

accessReviewResources:
  - group: operators.coreos.com
    resource: operatorgroups
    verb: list
  - group: packages.operators.coreos.com
    resource: packagemanifests
    verb: list
Linking to other quick starts
In the nextQuickStart section of the YAML file, provide the name, not the displayName, of the quick start to which you want to link. For example:
Supported tags for quick starts
Write your quick start content in markdown using these tags. The markdown is converted to HTML.
Quick start highlighting markdown reference
The highlighting, or hint, feature enables Quick Starts to contain a link that can highlight and animate a component of the web console.

The markdown syntax contains:

Bracketed link text

The highlight keyword, followed by the ID of the element that you want to animate

Code snippet markdown reference
You can execute a CLI code snippet when it is included in a quick start from the web console. To use this feature, you must first install the Web Terminal Operator. The web terminal and code snippet actions that execute in the web terminal are not present if you do not install the Web Terminal Operator. Alternatively, you can copy a code snippet to the clipboard regardless of whether you have the Web Terminal Operator installed or not.

Syntax for inline code snippets
`code block`{{copy}}
`code block`{{execute}}
If the execute syntax is used, the Copy to clipboard action is present whether you have the Web Terminal Operator installed or not.
Syntax for multi-line code snippets
```
multi line code block
```{{copy}}

Quick start content guidelines
Card copy
You can customize the title and description on a quick start card, but you cannot customize the status.

Keep your description to one to two sentences.

Start with a verb and communicate the goal of the user. Correct example:
Introduction
After clicking a quick start card, a side panel slides in that introduces the quick start and lists the tasks within it.

Make your introduction content clear, concise, informative, and friendly.

State the outcome of the quick start. A user should understand the purpose of the quick start before they begin.

Give action to the user, not the quick start.

The introduction should be a maximum of four to five sentences, depending on the complexity of the feature. A long introduction can overwhelm the user.

List the quick start tasks after the introduction content, and start each task with a verb. Do not specify the number of tasks because the copy would need to be updated every time a task is added or removed.
Task steps
After the user clicks Start, a series of steps appears that they must perform to complete the quick start.

Follow these general guidelines when writing task steps:

Use "Click" for buttons and labels. Use "Select" for checkboxes, radio buttons, and drop-down menus.

Use "Click" instead of "Click on"

Tell users how to navigate between Administrator and Developer perspectives. Even if you think a user might already be in the appropriate perspective, give them instructions on how to get there so that they are definitely where they need to be.

Use the "Location, action" structure. Tell a user where to go before telling them what to do.

Keep your product terminology capitalization consistent.

If you must specify a menu type or list as a dropdown, write "dropdown” as one word without a hyphen.

Clearly distinguish between a user action and additional information on product functionality.

Avoid directional language, like "In the top-right corner, click the icon". Directional language becomes outdated every time UI layouts change. Also, a direction for desktop users might not be accurate for users with a different screen size. Instead, identify something using its name.

Do not identify items by color alone, like "Click the gray circle". Color identifiers are not useful for sight-limited users, especially colorblind users. Instead, identify an item using its name or copy, like button copy.

Use the second-person point of view, you, consistently:
Check your work module
After a user completes a step, a Check your work module appears. This module prompts the user to answer a yes or no question about the step results, which gives them the opportunity to review their work. For this module, you only need to write a single yes or no question.
Formatting UI elements
Format UI elements using these guidelines:

Copy for buttons, dropdowns, tabs, fields, and other UI controls: Write the copy as it appears in the UI and bold it.

All other UI elements—including page, window, and panel names: Write the copy as it appears in the UI and bold it.

Code or user-entered text: Use monospaced font.

Hints: If a hint to a navigation or masthead element is included, style the text as you would a link.

CLI commands: Use monospaced font.

In running text, use a bold, monospaced font for a command.

If a parameter or option is a variable value, use an italic monospaced font.

Use a bold, monospaced font for the parameter and a monospaced font for the option.
