React hook for consuming Console extensions with resolved CodeRef properties. This hook accepts the same argument(s) as useExtensions hook and returns an adapted list of extension instances, resolving all code references within each extension's properties.

It returns a tuple containing a list of adapted extension instances with resolved code references, a boolean flag indicating whether the resolution is complete, and a list of errors detected during the resolution.

Troubleshooting your dynamic plugin
Refer to this list of troubleshooting tips if you run into issues loading your plugin.

Verify that you have enabled your plugin in the console Operator configuration and your plugin name is the output by running the following command:

Verify your plugin service is healthy by:

Verify your ConsolePlugin resource name (consolePlugin.name) matches the plugin name used in package.json.

Verify your service name, namespace, port, and path are declared correctly in the ConsolePlugin resource.

Verify your plugin service uses HTTPS and service serving certificates.

Verify any certificates or connection errors in the console pod logs.

Verify the feature flag your plugin relys on is not disabled.

Verify your plugin does not have any consolePlugin.dependencies in package.json that are not met.

Verify there are no typos in the nav extension perspective or section IDs.

Verify there are no network policies that are blocking traffic from the console pod to your plugin service.

Verify the list of dynamic plugins to be loaded in your browser in the Console tab of the developer tools browser.


Understanding service serving certificates
