Installing the web terminal

You can install the web terminal by using the Web Terminal Operator listed in the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" OperatorHub. When you install the Web Terminal Operator, the custom resource definitions (CRDs) that are required for the command line configuration, such as the DevWorkspace CRD, are automatically installed. The web console creates the required resources when you open the web terminal.

You have cluster administrator permissions.



In the Administrator perspective of the web console, navigate to Operators -> OperatorHub.

Use the Filter by keyword box to search for the Web Terminal Operator in the catalog, and then click the Web Terminal tile.

Read the brief description about the Operator on the Web Terminal  page, and then click Install.

On the Install Operator page, retain the default values for all fields.

Click Install.

In the Installed Operators page, click the View Operator to verify that the Operator is listed on the Installed Operators page.

After the Operator is installed, refresh your page to see the command line terminal icon () in the masthead of the console.
