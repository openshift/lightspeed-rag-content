# Network [config.openshift.io/v1]


Description:: 
Network holds cluster-wide information about Network. The canonical name is cluster. It is used to configure the desired network configuration, such as: IP address pools for services/pod IPs, network plugin, etc. Please view network.spec for an explanation on what applies when configuring this resource.
 Compatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).

# Specification



## .spec

Description:: 
spec holds user settable values for configuration. As a general rule, this SHOULD NOT be read directly. Instead, you should consume the NetworkStatus, as it indicates the currently deployed configuration. Currently, most spec fields are immutable after installation. Please view the individual ones for further details on each.
Type:: object



## .spec.clusterNetwork

Description:: 
IP address pool to use for pod IPs. This field is immutable after installation.
Type:: array

## .spec.clusterNetwork[]

Description:: 
ClusterNetworkEntry is a contiguous block of IP addresses from which pod IPs are allocated.
Type:: object



## .spec.externalIP

Description:: 
externalIP defines configuration for controllers that affect Service.ExternalIP. If nil, then ExternalIP is not allowed to be set.
Type:: object



## .spec.externalIP.policy

Description:: 
policy is a set of restrictions applied to the ExternalIP field. If nil or empty, then ExternalIP is not allowed to be set.
Type:: object



## .status

Description:: 
status holds observed values from the cluster. They may not be overridden.
Type:: object



## .status.clusterNetwork

Description:: 
IP address pool to use for pod IPs.
Type:: array

## .status.clusterNetwork[]

Description::

Type:: object



## .status.conditions

Description:: 
conditions represents the observations of a network.config current state. Known .status.conditions.type are: "NetworkTypeMigrationInProgress", "NetworkTypeMigrationMTUReady", "NetworkTypeMigrationTargetCNIAvailable", "NetworkTypeMigrationTargetCNIInUse" and "NetworkTypeMigrationOriginalCNIPurged"
Type:: array

## .status.conditions[]

Description:: 
Condition contains details for one aspect of the current state of this API Resource. --- This struct is intended for direct use as an array at the field path .status.conditions.  For example,
 type FooStatus struct{ // Represents the observations of a foo's current state. // Known .status.conditions.type are: "Available", "Progressing", and "Degraded" // +patchMergeKey=type // +patchStrategy=merge // +listType=map // +listMapKey=type Conditions []metav1.Condition json:"conditions,omitempty" patchStrategy:"merge" patchMergeKey:"type" protobuf:"bytes,1,rep,name=conditions"
 // other fields }
