Configuring OAuth clients

Several OAuth clients are created by default in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. You can also register and configure additional OAuth clients.
Default OAuth clients
The following OAuth clients are automatically created when starting the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform API:


<namespace_route> refers to the namespace route. This is found by
running the following command:
Registering an additional OAuth client
If you need an additional OAuth client to manage authentication for your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, you can register one.

To register additional OAuth clients:
Configuring token inactivity timeout for an OAuth client
You can configure OAuth clients to expire OAuth tokens after a set period of inactivity. By default, no token inactivity timeout is set.

If the token inactivity timeout is also configured in the internal OAuth server configuration, the timeout that is set in the OAuth client overrides that value.
You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

You have configured an identity provider (IDP).


Update the OAuthClient configuration to set a token inactivity timeout.


Log in to the cluster with an identity from your IDP. Be sure to use the OAuth client that you just configured.

Perform an action and verify that it was successful.

Wait longer than the configured timeout without using the identity. In this procedure's example, wait longer than 600 seconds.

Try to perform an action from the same identity's session.
