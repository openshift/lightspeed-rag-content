Configuring a Keystone identity provider

Configure the keystone identity provider to integrate your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster with Keystone to enable shared authentication with an OpenStack Keystone v3 server configured to store users in an internal database. This configuration allows users to log in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform with their Keystone credentials.
About identity providers in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
By default, only a kubeadmin user exists on your cluster. To specify an identity provider, you must create a custom resource (CR) that describes that identity provider and add it to the cluster.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform user names containing /, :, and % are not supported.
About Keystone authentication
Keystone is an OpenStack project that provides identity, token, catalog, and policy services.

You can configure the integration with Keystone so that the new Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform users are based on either the Keystone user names or unique Keystone IDs. With both methods, users log in by entering their Keystone user name and password. Basing the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform users on the Keystone ID is more secure because if you delete a Keystone user and create a new Keystone user with that user name, the new user might have access to the old user's resources.
Creating the secret
Identity providers use Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Secret objects in the openshift-config namespace to contain the client secret, client certificates, and keys.

Create a Secret object that contains the key and certificate by using the following command:
Creating a config map
Identity providers use Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform ConfigMap objects in the openshift-config namespace to contain the certificate authority bundle. These are primarily used to contain certificate bundles needed by the identity provider.

Define an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform ConfigMap object containing the
certificate authority by using the following command. The certificate
authority must be stored in the ca.crt key of the ConfigMap object.
Sample Keystone CR
The following custom resource (CR) shows the parameters and acceptable values for a Keystone identity provider.

apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: OAuth
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  identityProviders:
  - name: keystoneidp 1
    mappingMethod: claim 2
    type: Keystone
    keystone:
      domainName: default 3
      url: https://keystone.example.com:5000 4
      ca: 5
        name: ca-config-map
      tlsClientCert: 6
        name: client-cert-secret
      tlsClientKey: 7
        name: client-key-secret
This provider name is prefixed to provider user names to form an identity name.

Controls how mappings are established between this provider's identities and User objects.

Keystone domain name. In Keystone, usernames are domain-specific. Only a single domain is supported.

The URL to use to connect to the Keystone server (required). This must
use https.

Optional: Reference to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform ConfigMap object containing the
PEM-encoded certificate authority bundle to use in validating server
certificates for the configured URL.

Optional: Reference to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Secret object containing the client
certificate to present when making requests to the configured URL.

Reference to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Secret object containing the key for the
client certificate. Required if tlsClientCert is specified.


See Identity provider parameters for information on parameters, such as mappingMethod, that are common to all identity providers.
Adding an identity provider to your cluster
After you install your cluster, add an identity provider to it so your users can authenticate.

Create an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

Create the custom resource (CR) for your identity providers.

You must be logged in as an administrator.


Apply the defined CR:

Log in to the cluster as a user from your identity provider, entering the
password when prompted.

Confirm that the user logged in successfully, and display the user name.
