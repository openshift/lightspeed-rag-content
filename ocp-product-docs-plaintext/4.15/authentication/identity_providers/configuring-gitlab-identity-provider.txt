Configuring a GitLab identity provider

Configure the gitlab identity provider using GitLab.com or any other GitLab instance as an identity provider.
About GitLab authentication
Configuring GitLab authentication allows users to log in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform with their GitLab credentials.

If you use GitLab version 7.7.0 to 11.0, you connect using the OAuth integration. If you use GitLab version 11.1 or later, you can use OpenID Connect (OIDC) to connect instead of OAuth.
Creating the secret
Identity providers use Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Secret objects in the openshift-config namespace to contain the client secret, client certificates, and keys.

Create a Secret object containing a string by using the following command:

You can define a Secret object containing the contents of a file, such as a certificate file, by using the following command:
Creating a config map
Identity providers use Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform ConfigMap objects in the openshift-config namespace to contain the certificate authority bundle. These are primarily used to contain certificate bundles needed by the identity provider.

Define an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform ConfigMap object containing the
certificate authority by using the following command. The certificate
authority must be stored in the ca.crt key of the ConfigMap object.
Sample GitLab CR
The following custom resource (CR) shows the parameters and acceptable values for a GitLab identity provider.

apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: OAuth
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  identityProviders:
  - name: gitlabidp 1
    mappingMethod: claim 2
    type: GitLab
    gitlab:
      clientID: {...} 3
      clientSecret: 4
        name: gitlab-secret
      url: https://gitlab.com 5
      ca: 6
        name: ca-config-map
This provider name is prefixed to the GitLab numeric user ID to form an
identity name. It is also used to build the callback URL.

Controls how mappings are established between this provider's identities and User objects.

The client ID of a
registered GitLab OAuth application.
The application must be configured with a callback URL of
https://oauth-openshift.apps.<cluster-name>.<cluster-domain>/oauth2callback/<idp-provider-name>.

Reference to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Secret object containing the client secret
issued by GitLab.

The host URL of a GitLab provider. This could either be https://gitlab.com/
or any other self hosted instance of GitLab.

Optional: Reference to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform ConfigMap object containing the
PEM-encoded certificate authority bundle to use in validating server
certificates for the configured URL.


See Identity provider parameters for information on parameters, such as mappingMethod, that are common to all identity providers.
Adding an identity provider to your cluster
After you install your cluster, add an identity provider to it so your users can authenticate.

Create an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

Create the custom resource (CR) for your identity providers.

You must be logged in as an administrator.


Apply the defined CR:

Log in to the cluster as a user from your identity provider, entering the
password when prompted.

Confirm that the user logged in successfully, and display the user name.
