Configuring an OpenID Connect identity provider

Configure the oidc identity provider to integrate with an OpenID Connect identity provider using an Authorization Code Flow.
About OpenID Connect authentication
The Authentication Operator in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform requires that the configured OpenID Connect identity provider implements the OpenID Connect Discovery specification.

ID Token and UserInfo decryptions are not supported.
By default, the openid scope is requested. If required, extra scopes can be specified in the extraScopes field.

Claims are read from the JWT id_token returned from the OpenID identity provider and, if specified, from the JSON returned by the UserInfo URL.

At least one claim must be configured to use as the user's identity. The standard identity claim is sub.

You can also indicate which claims to use as the user's preferred user name, display name, and email address. If multiple claims are specified, the first one with a non-empty value is used. The following table lists the standard claims:


See the OpenID claims documentation for more information.

Unless your OpenID Connect identity provider supports the resource owner password credentials (ROPC) grant flow, users must get a token from <namespace_route>/oauth/token/request to use with command-line tools.
