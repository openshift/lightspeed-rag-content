Configuring a request header identity provider

Configure the request-header identity provider to identify users from request header values, such as X-Remote-User. It is typically used in combination with an authenticating proxy, which sets the request header value.
About identity providers in "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform"
By default, only a kubeadmin user exists on your cluster. To specify an identity provider, you must create a custom resource (CR) that describes that identity provider and add it to the cluster.

"Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" user names containing /, :, and % are not supported.
About request header authentication
A request header identity provider identifies users from request header values, such as X-Remote-User. It is typically used in combination with an authenticating proxy, which sets the request header value. The request header identity provider cannot be combined with other identity providers that use direct password logins, such as htpasswd, Keystone, LDAP or basic authentication.

You can also use the request header identity provider for advanced configurations such as the community-supported SAML authentication. Note that this solution is not supported by Red Hat.
For users to authenticate using this identity provider, they must access https://<namespace_route>/oauth/authorize (and subpaths) via an authenticating proxy. To accomplish this, configure the OAuth server to redirect unauthenticated requests for OAuth tokens to the proxy endpoint that proxies to https://<namespace_route>/oauth/authorize.

To redirect unauthenticated requests from clients expecting browser-based login flows:

Set the provider.loginURL parameter to the authenticating proxy URL that
will authenticate interactive clients and then proxy the request to
https://<namespace_route>/oauth/authorize.


To redirect unauthenticated requests from clients expecting WWW-Authenticate challenges:

Set the provider.challengeURL parameter to the authenticating proxy URL that
will authenticate clients expecting WWW-Authenticate challenges and then proxy
the request to https://<namespace_route>/oauth/authorize.


The provider.challengeURL and provider.loginURL parameters can include the following tokens in the query portion of the URL:

${url} is replaced with the current URL, escaped to be safe in a query parameter.

${query} is replaced with the current query string, unescaped.


As of "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" 4.1, your proxy must support mutual TLS.
SSPI connection support on Microsoft Windows
The OpenShift CLI (oc) supports the Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI) to allow for SSO flows on Microsft Windows. If you use the request header identity provider with a GSSAPI-enabled proxy to connect an Active Directory server to "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform", users can automatically authenticate to "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" by using the oc  command line interface from a domain-joined Microsoft Windows computer.
Creating a config map
Identity providers use "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" ConfigMap objects in the openshift-config namespace to contain the certificate authority bundle. These are primarily used to contain certificate bundles needed by the identity provider.

Define an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" ConfigMap object containing the
certificate authority by using the following command. The certificate
authority must be stored in the ca.crt key of the ConfigMap object.
Sample request header CR
The following custom resource (CR) shows the parameters and acceptable values for a request header identity provider.

apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: OAuth
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  identityProviders:
  - name: requestheaderidp 1
    mappingMethod: claim 2
    type: RequestHeader
    requestHeader:
      challengeURL: "https://www.example.com/challenging-proxy/oauth/authorize?${query}" 3
      loginURL: "https://www.example.com/login-proxy/oauth/authorize?${query}" 4
      ca: 5
        name: ca-config-map
      clientCommonNames: 6
      - my-auth-proxy
      headers: 7
      - X-Remote-User
      - SSO-User
      emailHeaders: 8
      - X-Remote-User-Email
      nameHeaders: 9
      - X-Remote-User-Display-Name
      preferredUsernameHeaders: 10
      - X-Remote-User-Login
This provider name is prefixed to the user name in the request header to
form an identity name.

Controls how mappings are established between this provider's identities and User objects.

Optional: URL to redirect unauthenticated /oauth/authorize requests to,
that will authenticate browser-based clients and then proxy their request to
https://<namespace_route>/oauth/authorize.
The URL that proxies to https://<namespace_route>/oauth/authorize must end with /authorize (with no trailing slash),
and also proxy subpaths, in order for OAuth approval flows to work properly.
${url} is replaced with the current URL, escaped to be safe in a query parameter.
${query} is replaced with the current query string.
If this attribute is not defined, then loginURL must be used.

Optional: URL to redirect unauthenticated /oauth/authorize requests to,
that will authenticate clients which expect WWW-Authenticate challenges, and
then proxy them to https://<namespace_route>/oauth/authorize.
${url} is replaced with the current URL, escaped to be safe in a query parameter.
${query} is replaced with the current query string.
If this attribute is not defined, then challengeURL must be used.

Reference to an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" ConfigMap object containing a PEM-encoded
certificate bundle. Used as a trust anchor to validate the TLS
certificates presented by the remote server.

Optional: list of common names (cn). If set, a valid client certificate with
a Common Name (cn) in the specified list must be presented before the request headers
are checked for user names. If empty, any Common Name is allowed. Can only be used in combination
with ca.

Header names to check, in order, for the user identity. The first header containing
a value is used as the identity. Required, case-insensitive.

Header names to check, in order, for an email address. The first header containing
a value is used as the email address. Optional, case-insensitive.

Header names to check, in order, for a display name. The first header containing
a value is used as the display name. Optional, case-insensitive.

Header names to check, in order, for a preferred user name, if different than the immutable
identity determined from the headers specified in headers. The first header containing
a value is used as the preferred user name when provisioning. Optional, case-insensitive.


See Identity provider parameters for information on parameters, such as mappingMethod, that are common to all identity providers.
Adding an identity provider to your cluster
After you install your cluster, add an identity provider to it so your users can authenticate.

Create an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster.

Create the custom resource (CR) for your identity providers.

You must be logged in as an administrator.


Apply the defined CR:

Log in to the cluster as a user from your identity provider, entering the
password when prompted.

Confirm that the user logged in successfully, and display the user name.
Example Apache authentication configuration using request header
This example configures an Apache authentication proxy for the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" using the request header identity provider.


Using the mod_auth_gssapi module is a popular way to configure the Apache authentication proxy using the request header identity provider; however, it is not required. Other proxies can easily be used if the following requirements are met:

Block the X-Remote-User header from client requests to prevent spoofing.

Enforce client certificate authentication in the RequestHeaderIdentityProvider
configuration.

Require the X-Csrf-Token header be set for all authentication requests using
the challenge flow.

Make sure only the /oauth/authorize endpoint and its subpaths are proxied;
redirects must be rewritten to allow the backend server to send the client to
the correct location.

The URL that proxies to \https://<namespace_route>/oauth/authorize must end
with /authorize with no trailing slash. For example, https://proxy.example.com/login-proxy/authorize?&#8230;&#8203;
must proxy to \https://<namespace_route>/oauth/authorize?&#8230;&#8203;.

Subpaths of the URL that proxies to \https://<namespace_route>/oauth/authorize
must proxy to subpaths of \https://<namespace_route>/oauth/authorize. For
example, https://proxy.example.com/login-proxy/authorize/approve?&#8230;&#8203; must
proxy to \https://<namespace_route>/oauth/authorize/approve?&#8230;&#8203;.


The \https://<namespace_route> address is the route to the OAuth server and can be obtained by running oc get route -n openshift-authentication.

This example uses the mod_auth_gssapi module to configure an Apache authentication proxy using the request header identity provider.

Obtain the mod_auth_gssapi module from the
Optional channel.
You must have the following packages installed on your local machine:

Generate a CA for validating requests that submit the trusted header. Define
an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" ConfigMap object containing the CA. This is done by running:

Generate a client certificate for the proxy. You can generate this certificate
by using any x509 certificate tooling. The client certificate must be signed by
the CA you generated for validating requests that submit the trusted header.

Create the custom resource (CR) for your identity providers.


This proxy uses a client certificate to connect to the OAuth server, which is configured to trust the X-Remote-User header.

Create the certificate for the Apache configuration. The certificate that you
specify as the SSLProxyMachineCertificateFile parameter value is the proxy's
client certificate that is used to authenticate the proxy to the server. It must
use TLS Web Client Authentication as the extended key type.

Create the Apache configuration. Use the following template to provide your
required settings and values:

Update the identityProviders stanza in the custom resource (CR):

Verify the configuration.
