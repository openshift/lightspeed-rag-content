Performing latency tests for platform verification

You can use the Cloud-native Network Functions (CNF) tests image to run latency tests on a CNF-enabled Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, where all the components required for running CNF workloads are installed. Run the latency tests to validate node tuning for your workload.

The cnf-tests container image is available at registry.redhat.io/openshift4/cnf-tests-rhel8:v4.15.
Prerequisites for running latency tests
Your cluster must meet the following requirements before you can run the latency tests:

You have configured a performance profile with the Node Tuning Operator.

You have applied all the required CNF configurations in the cluster.

You have a pre-existing MachineConfigPool CR applied in the cluster. The default worker pool is worker-cnf.


Scheduling a workload onto a worker with real-time capabilities
Measuring latency
The cnf-tests image uses three tools to measure the latency of the system:

hwlatdetect

cyclictest

oslat


Each tool has a specific use. Use the tools in sequence to achieve reliable test results.


hwlatdetect
Measures the baseline that the bare-metal hardware can achieve. Before proceeding with the next latency test, ensure that the latency reported by hwlatdetect meets the required threshold because you cannot fix hardware latency spikes by operating system tuning.
cyclictest
Verifies the real-time kernel scheduler latency after hwlatdetect passes validation. The cyclictest tool schedules a repeated timer and measures the difference between the desired and the actual trigger times. The difference can uncover basic issues with the tuning caused by interrupts or process priorities. The tool must run on a real-time kernel.
oslat
Behaves similarly to a CPU-intensive DPDK application and measures all the interruptions and disruptions to the busy loop that simulates CPU heavy data processing.


The tests introduce the following environment variables:


Variables that are specific to a latency tool take precedence over unified variables. For example, if OSLAT_MAXIMUM_LATENCY is set to 30 microseconds and MAXIMUM_LATENCY is set to 10 microseconds, the oslat test will run with maximum acceptable latency of 30 microseconds.
Running the latency tests
Run the cluster latency tests to validate node tuning for your Cloud-native Network Functions (CNF) workload.

When executing podman commands as a non-root or non-privileged user, mounting paths can fail with permission denied errors. To make the podman command work, append :Z to the volumes creation; for example, -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z. This allows podman to do the proper SELinux relabeling.
Open a shell prompt in the directory containing the kubeconfig file.

Run the latency tests by entering the following command:

Optional: Append --ginkgo.dryRun flag to run the latency tests in dry-run mode. This is useful for checking what commands the tests run.

Optional: Append --ginkgo.v flag to run the tests with increased verbosity.

Optional: Append --ginkgo.timeout="24h" flag to ensure the Ginkgo 2.0 test suite does not timeout before the latency tests complete.


Running hwlatdetect
The hwlatdetect tool is available in the rt-kernel package with a regular subscription of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9.x.

When executing podman commands as a non-root or non-privileged user, mounting paths can fail with permission denied errors. To make the podman command work, append :Z to the volumes creation; for example, -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z. This allows podman to do the proper SELinux relabeling.
You have installed the real-time kernel in the cluster.

You have logged in to registry.redhat.io with your Customer Portal credentials.


To run the hwlatdetect tests, run the following command, substituting variable values as appropriate:



You can capture the following types of results:

Rough results that are gathered after each run to create a history of impact on any changes made throughout the test.

The output of hwlatdetect shows that multiple samples exceed the threshold. However, the same output can indicate different results based on the following factors:

The duration of the test

The number of CPU cores

The host firmware settings


Before proceeding with the next latency test, ensure that the latency reported by hwlatdetect meets the required threshold. Fixing latencies introduced by hardware might require you to contact the system vendor support.

Not all latency spikes are hardware related. Ensure that you tune the host firmware to meet your workload requirements. For more information, see Setting firmware parameters for system tuning.
Running cyclictest
The cyclictest tool measures the real-time kernel scheduler latency on the specified CPUs.

When executing podman commands as a non-root or non-privileged user, mounting paths can fail with permission denied errors. To make the podman command work, append :Z to the volumes creation; for example, -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z. This allows podman to do the proper SELinux relabeling.
You have logged in to registry.redhat.io with your Customer Portal credentials.

You have installed the real-time kernel in the cluster.

You have applied a cluster performance profile by using Node Tuning Operator.


To perform the cyclictest, run the following command, substituting variable values as appropriate:



The same output can indicate different results for different workloads. For example, spikes up to 18μs are acceptable for 4G DU workloads, but not for 5G DU workloads.

running cmd: cyclictest -q -D 10m -p 1 -t 16 -a 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,54,56,58,60,62,64,66,68 -h 30 -i 1000 -m

Running oslat
The oslat test simulates a CPU-intensive DPDK application and measures all the interruptions and disruptions to test how the cluster handles CPU heavy data processing.

When executing podman commands as a non-root or non-privileged user, mounting paths can fail with permission denied errors. To make the podman command work, append :Z to the volumes creation; for example, -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z. This allows podman to do the proper SELinux relabeling.
You have logged in to registry.redhat.io with your Customer Portal credentials.

You have applied a cluster performance profile by using the Node Tuning Operator.


To perform the oslat test, run the following command, substituting variable values as appropriate:
Generating a latency test failure report
Use the following procedures to generate a JUnit latency test output and test failure report.

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You have logged in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.


Create a test failure report with information about the cluster state and resources for troubleshooting by passing the --report parameter with the path to where the report is dumped:
Generating a JUnit latency test report
Use the following procedures to generate a JUnit latency test output and test failure report.

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You have logged in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.


Create a JUnit-compliant XML report by passing the --junit parameter together with the path to where the report is dumped:
Running latency tests on a single-node OpenShift cluster
You can run latency tests on single-node OpenShift clusters.

When executing podman commands as a non-root or non-privileged user, mounting paths can fail with permission denied errors. To make the podman command work, append :Z to the volumes creation; for example, -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z. This allows podman to do the proper SELinux relabeling.
You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You have logged in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

You have applied a cluster performance profile by using the Node Tuning Operator.


To run the latency tests on a single-node OpenShift cluster, run the following command:
Running latency tests in a disconnected cluster
The CNF tests image can run tests in a disconnected cluster that is not able to reach external registries. This requires two steps:

Mirroring the cnf-tests image to the custom disconnected registry.

Instructing the tests to consume the images from the custom disconnected registry.



A mirror executable is shipped in the image to provide the input required by oc to mirror the test image to a local registry.

Run this command from an intermediate machine that has access to the cluster and registry.redhat.io:

When you have mirrored the cnf-tests image into the disconnected registry, you must override the original registry used to fetch the images when running the tests, for example:



You can run the latency tests using a custom test image and image registry using CNF_TESTS_IMAGE and IMAGE_REGISTRY variables.

To configure the latency tests to use a custom test image and image registry, run the following command:



Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform provides a built-in container image registry, which runs as a standard workload on the cluster.

Gain external access to the registry by exposing it with a route:

Fetch the registry endpoint by running the following command:

Create a namespace for exposing the images:

Make the image stream available to all the namespaces used for tests. This is required to allow the tests namespaces to fetch the images from the cnf-tests image stream. Run the following commands:

Retrieve the docker secret name and auth token by running the following commands:

Create a dockerauth.json file, for example:

Do the image mirroring:

Run the tests:



You can optionally change the default upstream images that are mirrored for the latency tests.

The mirror command tries to mirror the upstream images by default. This can be overridden by passing a file with the following format to the image:

Pass the file to the mirror command, for example saving it locally as images.json. With the following command, the local path is mounted in /kubeconfig inside the container and that can be passed to the mirror command.
Troubleshooting errors with the cnf-tests container
To run latency tests, the cluster must be accessible from within the cnf-tests container.

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You have logged in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.


Verify that the cluster is accessible from inside the cnf-tests container by running the following command:
