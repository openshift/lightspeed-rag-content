Low latency tuning

Understanding low latency
The emergence of Edge computing in the area of Telco / 5G plays a key role in reducing latency and congestion problems and improving application performance.

Simply put, latency determines how fast data (packets) moves from the sender to receiver and returns to the sender after processing by the receiver. Maintaining a network architecture with the lowest possible delay of latency speeds is key for meeting the network performance requirements of 5G. Compared to 4G technology, with an average latency of 50 ms, 5G is targeted to reach latency numbers of 1 ms or less. This reduction in latency boosts wireless throughput by a factor of 10.

Many of the deployed applications in the Telco space require low latency that can only tolerate zero packet loss. Tuning for zero packet loss helps mitigate the inherent issues that degrade network performance. For more information, see Tuning for Zero Packet Loss in Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP).

The Edge computing initiative also comes in to play for reducing latency rates. Think of it as being on the edge of the cloud and closer to the user. This greatly reduces the distance between the user and distant data centers, resulting in reduced application response times and performance latency.

Administrators must be able to manage their many Edge sites and local services in a centralized way so that all of the deployments can run at the lowest possible management cost. They also need an easy way to deploy and configure certain nodes of their cluster for real-time low latency and high-performance purposes. Low latency nodes are useful for applications such as Cloud-native Network Functions (CNF) and Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK).

"Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" currently provides mechanisms to tune software on an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster for real-time running and low latency (around <20 microseconds reaction time). This includes tuning the kernel and "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" set values, installing a kernel, and reconfiguring the machine. But this method requires setting up four different Operators and performing many configurations that, when done manually, is complex and could be prone to mistakes.

"Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" uses the Node Tuning Operator to implement automatic tuning to achieve low latency performance for "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" applications. The cluster administrator uses this performance profile configuration that makes it easier to make these changes in a more reliable way. The administrator can specify whether to update the kernel to kernel-rt, reserve CPUs for cluster and operating system housekeeping duties, including pod infra containers, and isolate CPUs for application containers to run the workloads.

In "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" 4.14, if you apply a performance profile to your cluster, all nodes in the cluster will reboot. This reboot includes control plane nodes and worker nodes that were not targeted by the performance profile. This is a known issue in "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" 4.14 because this release uses Linux control group version 2 (cgroup v2) in alignment with RHEL 9. The low latency tuning features associated with the performance profile do not support cgroup v2, therefore the nodes reboot to switch back to the cgroup v1 configuration.

To revert all nodes in the cluster to the cgroups v2 configuration, you must edit the Node resource. (OCPBUGS-16976)
Currently, disabling CPU load balancing is not supported by cgroup v2. As a result, you might not get the desired behavior from performance profiles if you have cgroup v2 enabled. Enabling cgroup v2 is not recommended if you are using performance profiles.
"Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" also supports workload hints for the Node Tuning Operator that can tune the PerformanceProfile to meet the demands of different industry environments. Workload hints are available for highPowerConsumption (very low latency at the cost of increased power consumption) and realTime (priority given to optimum latency). A combination of true/false settings for these hints can be used to deal with application-specific workload profiles and requirements.

Workload hints simplify the fine-tuning of performance to industry sector settings. Instead of a “one size fits all” approach, workload hints can cater to usage patterns such as placing priority on:

Low latency

Real-time capability

Efficient use of power


In an ideal world, all of those would be prioritized: in real life, some come at the expense of others. The Node Tuning Operator is now aware of the workload expectations and better able to meet the demands of the workload. The cluster admin can now specify into which use case that workload falls. The Node Tuning Operator uses the PerformanceProfile to fine tune the performance settings for the workload.

The environment in which an application is operating influences its behavior. For a typical data center with no strict latency requirements, only minimal default tuning is needed that enables CPU partitioning for some high performance workload pods. For data centers and workloads where latency is a higher priority, measures are still taken to optimize power consumption. The most complicated cases are clusters close to latency-sensitive equipment such as manufacturing machinery and software-defined radios. This last class of deployment is often referred to as Far edge. For Far edge deployments, ultra-low latency is the ultimate priority, and is achieved at the expense of power management.

About hyperthreading for low latency and real-time applications
Hyperthreading is an Intel processor technology that allows a physical CPU processor core to function as two logical cores, executing two independent threads simultaneously. Hyperthreading allows for better system throughput for certain workload types where parallel processing is beneficial. The default "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" configuration expects hyperthreading to be enabled by default.

For telecommunications applications, it is important to design your application infrastructure to minimize latency as much as possible. Hyperthreading can slow performance times and negatively affect throughput for compute intensive workloads that require low latency. Disabling hyperthreading ensures predictable performance and can decrease processing times for these workloads.

Hyperthreading implementation and configuration differs depending on the hardware you are running "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" on. Consult the relevant host hardware tuning information for more details of the hyperthreading implementation specific to that hardware. Disabling hyperthreading can increase the cost per core of the cluster.
Configuring hyperthreading for a cluster
Provisioning real-time and low latency workloads
Many industries and organizations need extremely high performance computing and might require low and predictable latency, especially in the financial and telecommunications industries. For these industries, with their unique requirements, "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" provides the Node Tuning Operator to implement automatic tuning to achieve low latency performance and consistent response time for "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" applications.

The cluster administrator can use this performance profile configuration to make these changes in a more reliable way. The administrator can specify whether to update the kernel to kernel-rt (real-time), reserve CPUs for cluster and operating system housekeeping duties, including pod infra containers, isolate CPUs for application containers to run the workloads, and disable unused CPUs to reduce power consumption.

The usage of execution probes in conjunction with applications that require guaranteed CPUs can cause latency spikes. It is recommended to use other probes, such as a properly configured set of network probes, as an alternative.
In earlier versions of "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform", the Performance Addon Operator was used to implement automatic tuning to achieve low latency performance for OpenShift applications. In "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" 4.11 and later, these functions are part of the Node Tuning Operator.
Known limitations for real-time
In most deployments, kernel-rt is supported only on worker nodes when you use a standard cluster with three control plane nodes and three worker nodes. There are exceptions for compact and single nodes on "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" deployments. For installations on a single node, kernel-rt is supported on the single control plane node.
To fully utilize the real-time mode, the containers must run with elevated privileges. See Set capabilities for a Container for information on granting privileges.

"Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" restricts the allowed capabilities, so you might need to create a SecurityContext as well.

This procedure is fully supported with bare metal installations using Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) systems.
Establishing the right performance expectations refers to the fact that the real-time kernel is not a panacea. Its objective is consistent, low-latency determinism offering predictable response times. There is some additional kernel overhead associated with the real-time kernel. This is due primarily to handling hardware interruptions in separately scheduled threads. The increased overhead in some workloads results in some degradation in overall throughput. The exact amount of degradation is very workload dependent, ranging from 0% to 30%. However, it is the cost of determinism.
Provisioning a worker with real-time capabilities
Optional: Add a node to the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster.
See Setting BIOS parameters for system tuning.

Add the label worker-rt to the worker nodes that require the real-time capability by using the oc command.

Create a new machine config pool for real-time nodes:

Add the node to the proper machine config pool by using node role labels.

Create the PerformanceProfile with the proper set of housekeeping cores and realTimeKernel: enabled: true.

You must set machineConfigPoolSelector in PerformanceProfile:

Verify that a matching machine config pool exists with a label:

"Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" will start configuring the nodes, which might involve multiple reboots. Wait for the nodes to settle. This can take a long time depending on the specific hardware you use, but 20 minutes per node is expected.

Verify everything is working as expected.
Verifying the real-time kernel installation
Use this command to verify that the real-time kernel is installed:

$ oc get node -o wide
Note the worker with the role worker-rt that contains the string 4.18.0-305.30.1.rt7.102.el8_4.x86_64   cri-o://1.28.5-99.rhaos4.10.gitc3131de.el8:

Creating a workload that works in real-time
Use the following procedures for preparing a workload that will use real-time capabilities.

Create a pod with a QoS class of Guaranteed.

Optional: Disable CPU load balancing for DPDK.

Assign a proper node selector.


When writing your applications, follow the general recommendations described in Application tuning and deployment.
Creating a pod with a QoS class of Guaranteed
Keep the following in mind when you create a pod that is given a QoS class of Guaranteed:

Every container in the pod must have a memory limit and a memory request, and they must be the same.

Every container in the pod must have a CPU limit and a CPU request, and they must be the same.


The following example shows the configuration file for a pod that has one container. The container has a memory limit and a memory request, both equal to 200 MiB. The container has a CPU limit and a CPU request, both equal to 1 CPU.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: qos-demo
  namespace: qos-example
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsNonRoot: true
    seccompProfile:
      type: RuntimeDefault
  containers:
  - name: qos-demo-ctr
    image: <image-pull-spec>
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "200Mi"
        cpu: "1"
      requests:
        memory: "200Mi"
        cpu: "1"
    securityContext:
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
      capabilities:
        drop: [ALL]
Create the pod:

View detailed information about the pod:
Optional: Disabling CPU load balancing for DPDK
Functionality to disable or enable CPU load balancing is implemented on the CRI-O level. The code under the CRI-O disables or enables CPU load balancing only when the following requirements are met.

The pod must use the performance-<profile-name> runtime class. You can get the proper name by looking at the status of the performance profile, as shown here:


Currently, disabling CPU load balancing is not supported with cgroup v2.
The Node Tuning Operator is responsible for the creation of the high-performance runtime handler config snippet under relevant nodes and for creation of the high-performance runtime class under the cluster. It will have the same content as default runtime handler except it enables the CPU load balancing configuration functionality.

To disable the CPU load balancing for the pod, the Pod specification must include the following fields:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  ...
  annotations:
    ...
    cpu-load-balancing.crio.io: "disable"
    ...
  ...
spec:
  ...
  runtimeClassName: performance-<profile_name>
  ...
Only disable CPU load balancing when the CPU manager static policy is enabled and for pods with guaranteed QoS that use whole CPUs. Otherwise, disabling CPU load balancing can affect the performance of other containers in the cluster.
Assigning a proper node selector
The preferred way to assign a pod to nodes is to use the same node selector the performance profile used, as shown here:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  # ...
  nodeSelector:
    node-role.kubernetes.io/worker-rt: ""
For more information, see Placing pods on specific nodes using node selectors.
Scheduling a workload onto a worker with real-time capabilities
Use label selectors that match the nodes attached to the machine config pool that was configured for low latency by the Node Tuning Operator. For more information, see Assigning pods to nodes.
Reducing power consumption by taking CPUs offline
You can generally anticipate telecommunication workloads. When not all of the CPU resources are required, the Node Tuning Operator allows you take unused CPUs offline to reduce power consumption by manually updating the performance profile.

To take unused CPUs offline, you must perform the following tasks:

Set the offline CPUs in the performance profile and save the contents of the YAML file:

Apply the updated profile by running the following command:
Optional: Power saving configurations
You can enable power savings for a node that has low priority workloads that are colocated with high priority workloads without impacting the latency or throughput of the high priority workloads. Power saving is possible without modifications to the workloads themselves.

The feature is supported on Intel Ice Lake and later generations of Intel CPUs. The capabilities of the processor might impact the latency and throughput of the high priority workloads.
When you configure a node with a power saving configuration, you must configure high priority workloads with performance configuration at the pod level, which means that the configuration applies to all the cores used by the pod.

By disabling P-states and C-states at the pod level, you can configure high priority workloads for best performance and lowest latency.


You enabled C-states and OS-controlled P-states in the BIOS


Generate a PerformanceProfile with per-pod-power-management set to true:

Set the default cpufreq governor as an additional kernel argument in the PerformanceProfile custom resource (CR):

Set the maximum CPU frequency in the TunedPerformancePatch CR:

Add the desired annotations to your high priority workload pods. The annotations override the default settings.

Restart the pods.


For more information about recommended firmware configuration, see Recommended firmware configuration for vDU cluster hosts.
Managing device interrupt processing for guaranteed pod isolated CPUs
The Node Tuning Operator can manage host CPUs by dividing them into reserved CPUs for cluster and operating system housekeeping duties, including pod infra containers, and isolated CPUs for application containers to run the workloads. This allows you to set CPUs for low latency workloads as isolated.

Device interrupts are load balanced between all isolated and reserved CPUs to avoid CPUs being overloaded, with the exception of CPUs where there is a guaranteed pod running. Guaranteed pod CPUs are prevented from processing device interrupts when the relevant annotations are set for the pod.

In the performance profile, globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing is used to manage whether device interrupts are processed or not. For certain workloads, the reserved CPUs are not always sufficient for dealing with device interrupts, and for this reason, device interrupts are not globally disabled on the isolated CPUs. By default, Node Tuning Operator does not disable device interrupts on isolated CPUs.

To achieve low latency for workloads, some (but not all) pods require the CPUs they are running on to not process device interrupts. A pod annotation, irq-load-balancing.crio.io, is used to define whether device interrupts are processed or not. When configured, CRI-O disables device interrupts only as long as the pod is running.

Disabling CPU CFS quota
To reduce CPU throttling for individual guaranteed pods, create a pod specification with the annotation cpu-quota.crio.io: "disable". This annotation disables the CPU completely fair scheduler (CFS) quota at the pod run time. The following pod specification contains this annotation:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  annotations:
      cpu-quota.crio.io: "disable"
spec:
    runtimeClassName: performance-<profile_name>
...
Only disable CPU CFS quota when the CPU manager static policy is enabled and for pods with guaranteed QoS that use whole CPUs. Otherwise, disabling CPU CFS quota can affect the performance of other containers in the cluster.
Disabling global device interrupts handling in Node Tuning Operator
To configure Node Tuning Operator to disable global device interrupts for the isolated CPU set, set the globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing field in the performance profile to true. When true, conflicting pod annotations are ignored. When false, IRQ loads are balanced across all CPUs.

A performance profile snippet illustrates this setting:

apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2
kind: PerformanceProfile
metadata:
  name: manual
spec:
  globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing: true
...
Disabling interrupt processing for individual pods
To disable interrupt processing for individual pods, ensure that globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing is set to false in the performance profile. Then, in the pod specification, set the irq-load-balancing.crio.io pod annotation to disable. The following pod specification contains this annotation:

apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2
kind: Pod
metadata:
  annotations:
      irq-load-balancing.crio.io: "disable"
spec:
    runtimeClassName: performance-<profile_name>
...
Upgrading the performance profile to use device interrupt processing
When you upgrade the Node Tuning Operator performance profile custom resource definition (CRD) from v1 or v1alpha1 to v2, globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing is set to true on existing profiles.

globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing toggles whether IRQ load balancing will be disabled for the Isolated CPU set. When the option is set to true it disables IRQ load balancing for the Isolated CPU set. Setting the option to false allows the IRQs to be balanced across all CPUs.
Supported API Versions
The Node Tuning Operator supports v2, v1, and v1alpha1 for the performance profile apiVersion field. The v1 and v1alpha1 APIs are identical. The v2 API includes an optional boolean field globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing with a default value of false.

Upgrading Node Tuning Operator API from v1alpha1 to v1
When upgrading Node Tuning Operator API version from v1alpha1 to v1, the v1alpha1 performance profiles are converted on-the-fly using a "None" Conversion strategy and served to the Node Tuning Operator with API version v1.
Upgrading Node Tuning Operator API from v1alpha1 or v1 to v2
When upgrading from an older Node Tuning Operator API version, the existing v1 and v1alpha1 performance profiles are converted using a conversion webhook that injects the globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing field with a value of true.
Tuning nodes for low latency with the performance profile
The performance profile lets you control latency tuning aspects of nodes that belong to a certain machine config pool. After you specify your settings, the PerformanceProfile object is compiled into multiple objects that perform the actual node level tuning:

A MachineConfig file that manipulates the nodes.

A KubeletConfig file that configures the Topology Manager, the CPU Manager, and the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" nodes.

The Tuned profile that configures the Node Tuning Operator.


You can use a performance profile to specify whether to update the kernel to kernel-rt, to allocate huge pages, and to partition the CPUs for performing housekeeping duties or running workloads.

In "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" {product-version}, if you apply a performance profile to your cluster, all nodes in the cluster will reboot. This reboot includes control plane nodes and worker nodes that were not targeted by the performance profile. This is a known issue in "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" {product-version} because this release uses Linux control group version 2 (cgroup v2) in alignment with RHEL 9. The low latency tuning features associated with the performance profile do not support cgroup v2, therefore the nodes reboot to switch back to the cgroup v1 configuration.

To revert all nodes in the cluster to the cgroups v2 configuration, you must edit the Node resource. (OCPBUGS-16976)
You can manually create the PerformanceProfile object or use the Performance Profile Creator (PPC) to generate a performance profile. See the additional resources below for more information on the PPC.
apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2
kind: PerformanceProfile
metadata:
 name: performance
spec:
 cpu:
  isolated: "4-15" 1
  reserved: "0-3" 2
 hugepages:
  defaultHugepagesSize: "1G"
  pages:
  - size: "1G"
    count: 16
    node: 0
 realTimeKernel:
  enabled: true  3
 numa:  4
  topologyPolicy: "best-effort"
 nodeSelector:
  node-role.kubernetes.io/worker-cnf: "" 5
Use this field to isolate specific CPUs to use with application containers for workloads. Set an even number of isolated CPUs to enable the pods to run without errors when hyperthreading is enabled.

Use this field to reserve specific CPUs to use with infra containers for housekeeping.

Use this field to install the real-time kernel on the node. Valid values are true or false. Setting the true value installs the real-time kernel.

Use this field to configure the topology manager policy. Valid values are none (default), best-effort, restricted, and single-numa-node. For more information, see Topology Manager Policies.

Use this field to specify a node selector to apply the performance profile to specific nodes.


For information on using the Performance Profile Creator (PPC) to generate a performance profile, see Creating a performance profile.


Configuring huge pages
Nodes must pre-allocate huge pages used in an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster. Use the Node Tuning Operator to allocate huge pages on a specific node.

"Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" provides a method for creating and allocating huge pages. Node Tuning Operator provides an easier method for doing  this using the performance profile.

For example, in the hugepages pages section of the performance profile, you can specify multiple blocks of size, count, and, optionally, node:

hugepages:
   defaultHugepagesSize: "1G"
   pages:
   - size:  "1G"
     count:  4
     node:  0 1
node is the NUMA node in which the huge pages are allocated. If you omit node, the pages are evenly spread across all NUMA nodes.


Wait for the relevant machine config pool status that indicates the update is finished.
These are the only configuration steps you need to do to allocate huge pages.

To verify the configuration, see the /proc/meminfo file on the node:

Use oc describe to report the new size:
Allocating multiple huge page sizes
You can request huge pages with different sizes under the same container. This allows you to define more complicated pods consisting of containers with different huge page size needs.

For example, you can define sizes 1G and 2M and the Node Tuning Operator will configure both sizes on the node, as shown here:

spec:
  hugepages:
    defaultHugepagesSize: 1G
    pages:
    - count: 1024
      node: 0
      size: 2M
    - count: 4
      node: 1
      size: 1G
Configuring a node for IRQ dynamic load balancing
Configure a cluster node for IRQ dynamic load balancing to control which cores can receive device interrupt requests (IRQ).

For core isolation, all server hardware components must support IRQ affinity. To check if the hardware components of your server support IRQ affinity, view the server's hardware specifications or contact your hardware provider.


Log in to the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

Set the performance profile apiVersion to use performance.openshift.io/v2.

Remove the globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing field or set it to false.

Set the appropriate isolated and reserved CPUs. The following snippet illustrates a profile that reserves 2 CPUs. IRQ load-balancing is enabled for pods running on the isolated CPU set:

Create the pod that uses exclusive CPUs, and set irq-load-balancing.crio.io and cpu-quota.crio.io annotations to disable. For example:

Enter the pod runtimeClassName in the form performance-<profile_name>, where <profile_name> is the name from the PerformanceProfile YAML, in this example, performance-dynamic-irq-profile.

Set the node selector to target a cnf-worker.

Ensure the pod is running correctly. Status should be running, and the correct cnf-worker node should be set:

Get the CPUs that the pod configured for IRQ dynamic load balancing runs on:

Ensure the node configuration is applied correctly. Log in to the node to verify the configuration.

Verify that you can use the node file system:

Ensure the default system CPU affinity mask does not include the dynamic-irq-pod CPUs, for example, CPUs 2 and 3.

Ensure the system IRQs are not configured to run on the dynamic-irq-pod CPUs:
About support of IRQ affinity setting
Some IRQ controllers lack support for IRQ affinity setting and will always expose all online CPUs as the IRQ mask. These IRQ controllers effectively run on CPU 0.

The following are examples of drivers and hardware that Red Hat are aware lack support for IRQ affinity setting. The list is, by no means, exhaustive:

Some RAID controller drivers, such as megaraid_sas

Many non-volatile memory express (NVMe) drivers

Some LAN on motherboard (LOM) network controllers

The driver uses managed_irqs


The reason they do not support IRQ affinity setting might be associated with factors such as the type of processor, the IRQ controller, or the circuitry connections in the motherboard.
If the effective affinity of any IRQ is set to an isolated CPU, it might be a sign of some hardware or driver not supporting IRQ affinity setting. To find the effective affinity, log in to the host and run the following command:

$ find /proc/irq -name effective_affinity -printf "%p: " -exec cat {} \;
/proc/irq/0/effective_affinity: 1
/proc/irq/1/effective_affinity: 8
/proc/irq/2/effective_affinity: 0
/proc/irq/3/effective_affinity: 1
/proc/irq/4/effective_affinity: 2
/proc/irq/5/effective_affinity: 1
/proc/irq/6/effective_affinity: 1
/proc/irq/7/effective_affinity: 1
/proc/irq/8/effective_affinity: 1
/proc/irq/9/effective_affinity: 2
/proc/irq/10/effective_affinity: 1
/proc/irq/11/effective_affinity: 1
/proc/irq/12/effective_affinity: 4
/proc/irq/13/effective_affinity: 1
/proc/irq/14/effective_affinity: 1
/proc/irq/15/effective_affinity: 1
/proc/irq/24/effective_affinity: 2
/proc/irq/25/effective_affinity: 4
/proc/irq/26/effective_affinity: 2
/proc/irq/27/effective_affinity: 1
/proc/irq/28/effective_affinity: 8
/proc/irq/29/effective_affinity: 4
/proc/irq/30/effective_affinity: 4
/proc/irq/31/effective_affinity: 8
/proc/irq/32/effective_affinity: 8
/proc/irq/33/effective_affinity: 1
/proc/irq/34/effective_affinity: 2
Some drivers use managed_irqs, whose affinity is managed internally by the kernel and userspace cannot change the affinity. In some cases, these IRQs might be assigned to isolated CPUs. For more information about managed_irqs, see Affinity of managed interrupts cannot be changed even if they target isolated CPU.
Configuring hyperthreading for a cluster
To configure hyperthreading for an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster, set the CPU threads in the performance profile to the same cores that are configured for the reserved or isolated CPU pools.

If you configure a performance profile, and subsequently change the hyperthreading configuration for the host, ensure that you update the CPU isolated and reserved fields in the PerformanceProfile YAML to match the new configuration.
Disabling a previously enabled host hyperthreading configuration can cause the CPU core IDs listed in the PerformanceProfile YAML to be incorrect. This incorrect configuration can cause the node to become unavailable because the listed CPUs can no longer be found.
Access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).


Ascertain which threads are running on what CPUs for the host you want to configure.

Apply the isolated and reserved CPUs in the PerformanceProfile YAML. For example, you can set logical cores CPU0 and CPU4 as isolated, and logical cores CPU1 to CPU3 and CPU5 to CPU7 as reserved. When you configure reserved and isolated CPUs, the infra containers in pods use the reserved CPUs and the application containers use the isolated CPUs.


Hyperthreading is enabled by default on most Intel processors. If you enable hyperthreading, all threads processed by a particular core must be isolated or processed on the same core.
Disabling hyperthreading for low latency applications
When configuring clusters for low latency processing, consider whether you want to disable hyperthreading before you deploy the cluster. To disable hyperthreading, do the following:

Create a performance profile that is appropriate for your hardware and topology.

Set nosmt as an additional kernel argument. The following example performance profile illustrates this setting:
Understanding workload hints
The following table describes how combinations of power consumption and real-time settings impact on latency.

The following workload hints can be configured manually. You can also work with workload hints using the Performance Profile Creator. For more information about the performance profile, see the "Creating a performance profile" section. If the workload hint is configured manually and the realTime workload hint is not explicitly set then it defaults to true.

For information about using the Performance Profile Creator (PPC) to generate a performance profile, see Creating a performance profile.
Configuring workload hints manually
Create a PerformanceProfile appropriate for the environment's hardware and topology as described in the table in "Understanding workload hints". Adjust the profile to match the expected workload. In this example, we tune for the lowest possible latency.

Add the highPowerConsumption and realTime workload hints. Both are set to true here.


When the realTime workload hint flag is set to true in a performance profile, add the cpu-quota.crio.io: disable annotation to every guaranteed pod with pinned CPUs. This annotation is necessary to prevent the degradation of the process performance within the pod. If the realTime workload hint is not explicitly set then it defaults to true.
For information about reducing CPU throttling for individual guaranteed pods, see Disabling CPU CFS quota.
Restricting CPUs for infra and application containers
Generic housekeeping and workload tasks use CPUs in a way that may impact latency-sensitive processes. By default, the container runtime uses all online CPUs to run all containers together, which can result in context switches and spikes in latency. Partitioning the CPUs prevents noisy processes from interfering with latency-sensitive processes by separating them from each other. The following table describes how processes run on a CPU after you have tuned the node using the Node Tuning Operator:


The allocatable capacity of cores on a node for pods of all QoS process types, Burstable,  BestEffort, or Guaranteed, is equal to the capacity of the isolated pool. The capacity of the reserved pool is removed from the node's total core capacity for use by the cluster and operating system housekeeping duties.

A node features a capacity of 100 cores. Using a performance profile, the cluster administrator allocates 50 cores to the isolated pool and 50 cores to the reserved pool. The cluster administrator assigns 25 cores to QoS Guaranteed pods and 25 cores for BestEffort or Burstable pods. This matches the capacity of the isolated pool.

A node features a capacity of 100 cores. Using a performance profile, the cluster administrator allocates 50 cores to the isolated pool and 50 cores to the reserved pool. The cluster administrator assigns 50 cores to QoS Guaranteed pods and one core for BestEffort or Burstable pods. This exceeds the capacity of the isolated pool by one core. Pod scheduling fails because of insufficient CPU capacity.

The exact partitioning pattern to use depends on many factors like hardware, workload characteristics and the expected system load. Some sample use cases are as follows:

If the latency-sensitive workload uses specific hardware, such as a network interface controller (NIC), ensure that the CPUs in the isolated pool are as close as possible to this hardware. At a minimum, you should place the workload in the same Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) node.

The reserved pool is used for handling all interrupts. When depending on system networking, allocate a sufficiently-sized reserve pool to handle all the incoming packet interrupts. In {product-version} and later versions, workloads can optionally be labeled as sensitive.


The decision regarding which specific CPUs should be used for reserved and isolated partitions requires detailed analysis and measurements. Factors like NUMA affinity of devices and memory play a role. The selection also depends on the workload architecture and the specific use case.

The reserved and isolated CPU pools must not overlap and together must span all available cores in the worker node.
To ensure that housekeeping tasks and workloads do not interfere with each other, specify two groups of CPUs in the spec section of the performance profile.

isolated - Specifies the CPUs for the application container workloads. These CPUs have the lowest latency. Processes in this group have no interruptions and can, for example, reach much higher DPDK zero packet loss bandwidth.

reserved - Specifies the CPUs for the cluster and operating system housekeeping duties. Threads in the reserved group are often busy. Do not run latency-sensitive applications in the reserved group. Latency-sensitive applications run in the isolated group.


Create a performance profile appropriate for the environment's hardware and topology.

Add the reserved and isolated parameters with the CPUs you want reserved and isolated for the infra and application containers:

Reducing NIC queues using the Node Tuning Operator
The Node Tuning Operator allows you to adjust the network interface controller (NIC) queue count for each network device. By using a PerformanceProfile, the amount of queues can be reduced to the number of reserved CPUs.

Adjusting the NIC queues with the performance profile
The performance profile lets you adjust the queue count for each network device.

Supported network devices:

Non-virtual network devices

Network devices that support multiple queues (channels)


Unsupported network devices:

Pure software network interfaces

Block devices

Intel DPDK virtual functions


Access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).


Log in to the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster running the Node Tuning Operator as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

Create and apply a performance profile appropriate for your hardware and topology. For guidance on creating a profile, see the "Creating a performance profile" section.

Edit this created performance profile:

Populate the spec field with the net object. The object list can contain two fields:

Set the queue count to the reserved CPU count for all devices by using this example performance profile:

Set the queue count to the reserved CPU count for all devices matching any of the defined device identifiers by using this example performance profile:

Set the queue count to the reserved CPU count for all devices starting with the interface name eth by using this example performance profile:

Set the queue count to the reserved CPU count for all devices with an interface named anything other than eno1 by using this example performance profile:

Set the queue count to the reserved CPU count for all devices that have an interface name eth0, vendorID of 0x1af4, and deviceID of 0x1000 by using this example performance profile:

Apply the updated performance profile:


Creating a performance profile.
Verifying the queue status
In this section, a number of examples illustrate different performance profiles and how to verify the changes are applied.

In this example, the net queue count is set to the reserved CPU count (2) for all supported devices.

The relevant section from the performance profile is:

apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2
metadata:
  name: performance
spec:
  kind: PerformanceProfile
  spec:
    cpu:
      reserved: 0-1  #total = 2
      isolated: 2-8
    net:
      userLevelNetworking: true
# ...
Display the status of the queues associated with a device using the following command:

Verify the queue status before the profile is applied:

Verify the queue status after the profile is applied:


The combined channel shows that the total count of reserved CPUs for all supported devices is 2. This matches what is configured in the performance profile.


In this example, the net queue count is set to the reserved CPU count (2) for all supported network devices with a specific vendorID.

The relevant section from the performance profile is:

apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2
metadata:
  name: performance
spec:
  kind: PerformanceProfile
  spec:
    cpu:
      reserved: 0-1  #total = 2
      isolated: 2-8
    net:
      userLevelNetworking: true
      devices:
      - vendorID = 0x1af4
# ...
Display the status of the queues associated with a device using the following command:

Verify the queue status after the profile is applied:


The total count of reserved CPUs for all supported devices with vendorID=0x1af4 is 2.
For example, if there is another network device ens2 with vendorID=0x1af4 it will also have total net queues of 2. This matches what is configured in the performance profile.


In this example, the net queue count is set to the reserved CPU count (2) for all supported network devices that match any of the defined device identifiers.

The command udevadm info provides a detailed report on a device. In this example the devices are:

# udevadm info -p /sys/class/net/ens4
...
E: ID_MODEL_ID=0x1000
E: ID_VENDOR_ID=0x1af4
E: INTERFACE=ens4
...
# udevadm info -p /sys/class/net/eth0
...
E: ID_MODEL_ID=0x1002
E: ID_VENDOR_ID=0x1001
E: INTERFACE=eth0
...
Set the net queues to 2 for a device with interfaceName equal to eth0 and any devices that have a vendorID=0x1af4 with the following performance profile:

Verify the queue status after the profile is applied:
Logging associated with adjusting NIC queues
Log messages detailing the assigned devices are recorded in the respective Tuned daemon logs. The following messages might be recorded to the /var/log/tuned/tuned.log file:

An INFO message is recorded detailing the successfully assigned devices:

A WARNING message is recorded if none of the devices can be assigned:
Debugging low latency CNF tuning status
The PerformanceProfile custom resource (CR) contains status fields for reporting tuning status and debugging latency degradation issues. These fields report on conditions that describe the state of the operator's reconciliation functionality.

A typical issue can arise when the status of machine config pools that are attached to the performance profile are in a degraded state, causing the PerformanceProfile status to degrade. In this case, the machine config pool issues a failure message.

The Node Tuning Operator contains the performanceProfile.spec.status.Conditions status field:

  Conditions:
    Last Heartbeat Time:   2020-06-02T10:01:24Z
    Last Transition Time:  2020-06-02T10:01:24Z
    Status:                True
    Type:                  Available

    Status:                False
    Type:                  Degraded
The Status field contains Conditions that specify Type values that indicate the status of the performance profile:


Available
All machine configs and Tuned profiles have been created successfully and are available for cluster components are responsible to process them (NTO, MCO, Kubelet).
Upgradeable
Indicates whether the resources maintained by the Operator are in a state that is safe to upgrade.
Progressing
Indicates that the deployment process from the performance profile has started.
Degraded
Indicates an error if:


Each of these types contain the following fields:


Status
The state for the specific type (true or false).
Timestamp
The transaction timestamp.
Reason string
The machine readable reason.
Message string
The human readable reason describing the state and error details, if any.


Machine config pools
A performance profile and its created products are applied to a node according to an associated machine config pool (MCP). The MCP holds valuable information about the progress of applying the machine configurations created by performance profiles that encompass kernel args, kube config, huge pages allocation, and deployment of rt-kernel. The Performance Profile controller monitors changes in the MCP and updates the performance profile status accordingly.

The only conditions returned by the MCP to the performance profile status is when the MCP is Degraded, which leads to performanceProfile.status.condition.Degraded = true.

The following example is for a performance profile with an associated machine config pool (worker-cnf) that was created for it:

The associated machine config pool is in a degraded state:

The describe section of the MCP shows the reason:

The degraded state should also appear under the performance profile status field marked as degraded = true:
Collecting low latency tuning debugging data for Red Hat Support
When opening a support case, it is helpful to provide debugging information about your cluster to Red Hat Support.

The must-gather tool enables you to collect diagnostic information about your "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster, including node tuning, NUMA topology, and other information needed to debug issues with low latency setup.

For prompt support, supply diagnostic information for both "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" and low latency tuning.

About the must-gather tool
The oc adm must-gather CLI command collects the information from your cluster that is most likely needed for debugging issues, such as:

Resource definitions

Audit logs

Service logs


You can specify one or more images when you run the command by including the --image argument. When you specify an image, the tool collects data related to that feature or product. When you run oc adm must-gather, a new pod is created on the cluster. The data is collected on that pod and saved in a new directory that starts with must-gather.local. This directory is created in your current working directory.
Gathering low latency tuning data
Use the oc adm must-gather CLI command to collect information about your cluster, including features and objects associated with low latency tuning, including:

The Node Tuning Operator namespaces and child objects.

MachineConfigPool and associated MachineConfig objects.

The Node Tuning Operator and associated Tuned objects.

Linux kernel command line options.

CPU and NUMA topology

Basic PCI device information and NUMA locality.


Access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

The "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" CLI (oc) installed.


Navigate to the directory where you want to store the must-gather data.

Collect debugging information by running the following command:

Create a compressed file from the must-gather directory that was created in your working directory. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

Attach the compressed file to your support case on the Red Hat Customer Portal.
