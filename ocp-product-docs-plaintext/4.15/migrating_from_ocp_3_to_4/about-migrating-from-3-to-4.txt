About migrating from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3 to 4

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 contains new technologies and functionality that result in a cluster that is self-managing, flexible, and automated. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 clusters are deployed and managed very differently from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.

The most effective way to migrate from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3 to 4 is by using a CI/CD pipeline to automate deployments in an application lifecycle management framework.

If you do not have a CI/CD pipeline or if you are migrating stateful applications, you can use the Migration Toolkit for Containers (MTC) to migrate your application workloads.

You can use Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes to help you import and manage your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3 clusters easily, enforce policies, and redeploy your applications. Take advantage of the free subscription to use Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management to simplify your migration process.

To successfully transition to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4, review the following information:
