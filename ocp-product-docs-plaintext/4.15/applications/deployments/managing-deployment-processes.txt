Managing deployment processes

Managing DeploymentConfig objects
As of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14, DeploymentConfig objects are deprecated. DeploymentConfig objects are still supported, but are not recommended for new installations. Only security-related and critical issues will be fixed.

Instead, use Deployment objects or another alternative to provide declarative updates for pods.
DeploymentConfig objects can be managed from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console's Workloads page or using the oc CLI. The following procedures show CLI usage unless otherwise stated.

Starting a deployment
You can start a rollout to begin the deployment process of your application.

To start a new deployment process from an existing DeploymentConfig object, run the following command:
Viewing a deployment
You can view a deployment to get basic information about all the available revisions of your application.

To show details about all recently created replication controllers for the provided DeploymentConfig object, including any currently running deployment process, run the following command:

To view details specific to a revision, add the --revision flag:

For more detailed information about a DeploymentConfig object and its latest revision, use the oc describe command:
Retrying a deployment
If the current revision of your DeploymentConfig object failed to deploy, you can restart the deployment process.

To restart a failed deployment process:
Rolling back a deployment
Rollbacks revert an application back to a previous revision and can be performed using the REST API, the CLI, or the web console.

To rollback to the last successful deployed revision of your configuration:

Image change triggers on the DeploymentConfig object are disabled as part of the rollback to prevent accidentally starting a new deployment process soon after the rollback is complete.


Deployment configs also support automatically rolling back to the last successful revision of the configuration in case the latest deployment process fails. In that case, the latest template that failed to deploy stays intact by the system and it is up to users to fix their configurations.
Executing commands inside a container
You can add a command to a container, which modifies the container's startup behavior by overruling the image's ENTRYPOINT. This is different from a lifecycle hook, which instead can be run once per deployment at a specified time.

Add the command parameters to the spec field of the DeploymentConfig object. You can also add an args field, which modifies the command (or the ENTRYPOINT if command does not exist).
Viewing deployment logs
To stream the logs of the latest revision for a given DeploymentConfig object:

You can also view logs from older failed deployment processes, if and only if these processes (old replication controllers and their deployer pods) exist and have not been pruned or deleted manually:
Deployment triggers
A DeploymentConfig object can contain triggers, which drive the creation of new deployment processes in response to events inside the cluster.

If no triggers are defined on a DeploymentConfig object, a config change trigger is added by default. If triggers are defined as an empty field, deployments must be started manually.

The config change trigger results in a new replication controller whenever configuration changes are detected in the pod template of the DeploymentConfig object.

If a config change trigger is defined on a DeploymentConfig object, the first replication controller is automatically created soon after the DeploymentConfig object itself is created and it is not paused.
kind: DeploymentConfig
apiVersion: apps.openshift.io/v1
metadata:
  name: example-dc
# ...
spec:
# ...
  triggers:
    - type: "ConfigChange"

The image change trigger results in a new replication controller whenever the content of an image stream tag changes (when a new version of the image is pushed).

kind: DeploymentConfig
apiVersion: apps.openshift.io/v1
metadata:
  name: example-dc
# ...
spec:
# ...
  triggers:
    - type: "ImageChange"
      imageChangeParams:
        automatic: true 1
        from:
          kind: "ImageStreamTag"
          name: "origin-ruby-sample:latest"
          namespace: "myproject"
        containerNames:
          - "helloworld"
If the imageChangeParams.automatic field is set to false, the trigger is disabled.


With the above example, when the latest tag value of the origin-ruby-sample image stream changes and the new image value differs from the current image specified in the DeploymentConfig object's helloworld container, a new replication controller is created using the new image for the helloworld container.

If an image change trigger is defined on a DeploymentConfig object (with a config change trigger and automatic=false, or with automatic=true) and the image stream tag pointed by the image change trigger does not exist yet, the initial deployment process will automatically start as soon as an image is imported or pushed by a build to the image stream tag.
Setting deployment triggers
You can set deployment triggers for a DeploymentConfig object using the oc set triggers command. For example, to set a image change trigger, use the following command:
Setting deployment resources
A deployment is completed by a pod that consumes resources (memory, CPU, and ephemeral storage) on a node. By default, pods consume unbounded node resources. However, if a project specifies default container limits, then pods consume resources up to those limits.

The minimum memory limit for a deployment is 12 MB. If a container fails to start due to a Cannot allocate memory pod event, the memory limit is too low. Either increase or remove the memory limit. Removing the limit allows pods to consume unbounded node resources.
You can also limit resource use by specifying resource limits as part of the deployment strategy. Deployment resources can be used with the recreate, rolling, or custom deployment strategies.

In the following example, each of resources, cpu, memory, and ephemeral-storage is optional:


For more information about resource limits and requests, see Understanding managing application memory.
Scaling manually
In addition to rollbacks, you can exercise fine-grained control over the number of replicas by manually scaling them.

Pods can also be auto-scaled using the oc autoscale command.
To manually scale a DeploymentConfig object, use the oc scale command. For example, the following command sets the replicas in the frontend DeploymentConfig object to 3.
Accessing private repositories from DeploymentConfig objects
You can add a secret to your DeploymentConfig object so that it can access images from a private repository. This procedure shows the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console method.

Create a new project.

Navigate to Workloads -> Secrets.

Create a secret that contains credentials for accessing a private image repository.

Navigate to Workloads -> DeploymentConfigs.

Create a DeploymentConfig object.

On the DeploymentConfig object editor page, set the Pull Secret and save your changes.
Running a pod with a different service account
You can run a pod with a service account other than the default.

Edit the DeploymentConfig object:

Add the serviceAccount and serviceAccountName parameters to the spec field, and specify the service account you want to use:
