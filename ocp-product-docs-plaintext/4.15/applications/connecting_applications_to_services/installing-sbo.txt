# Installing Service Binding Operator


This guide walks cluster administrators through the process of installing the Service Binding Operator to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
You can install Service Binding Operator on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.7 and later.
## Prerequisites
* You have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster using an account with cluster-admin permissions.
* Your cluster has the Marketplace capability enabled or the Red Hat Operator catalog source configured manually.

# Installing the Service Binding Operator using the web console

You can install Service Binding Operator using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform OperatorHub. When you install the Service Binding Operator, the custom resources (CRs) required for the service binding configuration are automatically installed along with the Operator.

1. In the Administrator perspective of the web console, navigate to Operators -> OperatorHub.
2. Use the Filter by keyword box to search for Service Binding Operator in the catalog. Click the Service Binding Operator tile.
3. Read the brief description about the Operator on the Service Binding Operator page. Click Install.
4. On the Install Operator page:
1. Select All namespaces on the cluster (default) for the Installation Mode. This mode installs the Operator in the default openshift-operators namespace, which enables the Operator to watch and be made available to all namespaces in the cluster.
2. Select Automatic for the Approval Strategy. This ensures that the future upgrades to the Operator are handled automatically by the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM). If you select the Manual approval strategy, OLM creates an update request. As a cluster administrator, you must then manually approve the OLM update request to update the Operator to the new version.
3. Select an Update Channel.
* By default, the stable channel enables installation of the latest stable and supported release of the Service Binding Operator.
5. Click Install.

[NOTE]
----
The Operator is installed automatically into the openshift-operators namespace.
----
6. On the Installed Operator - ready for use pane, click View Operator. You will see the Operator listed on the Installed Operators page.
7. Verify that the Status is set to Succeeded  to confirm successful installation of Service Binding Operator.
