Getting started with service binding

The Service Binding Operator manages the data plane for workloads and backing services. This guide provides instructions with examples to help you create a database instance, deploy an application, and use the Service Binding Operator to create a binding connection between the application and the database service.


You have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster using an account with cluster-admin permissions.

You have installed the oc CLI.

You have installed Service Binding Operator from OperatorHub.

You have installed the 5.1.2 version of the Crunchy Postgres for Kubernetes Operator from OperatorHub using the v5 Update channel. The installed Operator is available in an appropriate namespace, such as the my-petclinic namespace.

You have installed the 5.1.2 version of the Crunchy Postgres for Kubernetes Operator from OperatorHub using the v5 Update channel. The installed Operator is available in an appropriate project, such as the my-petclinic project.
Creating a PostgreSQL database instance
To create a PostgreSQL database instance, you must create a PostgresCluster custom resource (CR) and configure the database.

Create the PostgresCluster CR in the my-petclinic namespace by running the following command in shell:

After you have created the database instance, ensure that all the pods in the my-petclinic namespace are running:
Deploying the Spring PetClinic sample application
To deploy the Spring PetClinic sample application on an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, you must use a deployment configuration and configure your local environment to be able to test the application.

Deploy the spring-petclinic application with the PostgresCluster custom resource (CR) by running the following command in shell:

Verify that the application is not yet connected to the database service by running the following command:

Expose the service to create a route for your application:


You can now use the Service Binding Operator to connect the application to the database service.
Connecting the Spring PetClinic sample application to the PostgreSQL database service
To connect the sample application to the database service, you must create a ServiceBinding custom resource (CR) that triggers the Service Binding Operator to project the binding data into the application.

Create a ServiceBinding CR to project the binding data:

Verify that the request for service binding is successful:

Set up the port forwarding from the application port to access the sample application from your local environment:

Access http://localhost:8080/petclinic.
