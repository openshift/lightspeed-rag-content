# Release notes for Service Binding Operator


The Service Binding Operator consists of a controller and an accompanying custom resource definition (CRD) for service binding. It manages the data plane for workloads and backing services. The Service Binding Controller reads the data made available by the control plane of backing services. Then, it projects this data to workloads according to the rules specified through the ServiceBinding resource.
With Service Binding Operator, you can:
* Bind your workloads together with Operator-managed backing services.
* Automate configuration of binding data.
* Provide service operators a low-touch administrative experience to provision and manage access to services.
* Enrich development lifecycle with a consistent and declarative service binding method that eliminates discrepancies in cluster environments.
The custom resource definition (CRD) of the Service Binding Operator supports the following APIs:
* Service Binding with the binding.operators.coreos.com API group.
* Service Binding (Spec API) with the servicebinding.io API group.

# Making open source more inclusive

Red Hat is committed to replacing problematic language in our code, documentation, and web properties. We are beginning with these four terms: master, slave, blacklist, and whitelist. Because of the enormity of this endeavor, these changes will be implemented gradually over several upcoming releases. For more details, see Red Hat CTO Chris Wright's message.

# Release notes for Service Binding Operator 1.3.3

Service Binding Operator 1.3.3 is now available on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.9, 4.10, 4.11 and 4.12.

## Fixed issues

* Before this update, a security vulnerability CVE-2022-41717 was noted for Service Binding Operator. This update fixes the CVE-2022-41717 error and updates the golang.org/x/net package from v0.0.0-20220906165146-f3363e06e74c to v0.4.0. APPSVC-1256
* Before this update, Provisioned Services were only detected if the respective resource had the "servicebinding.io/provisioned-service: true" annotation set while other Provisioned Services were missed. With this update, the detection mechanism identifies all Provisioned Services correctly based on the "status.binding.name" attribute. APPSVC-1204

# Release notes for Service Binding Operator 1.3.1

Service Binding Operator 1.3.1 is now available on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.9, 4.10, and 4.11.

## Fixed issues

* Before this update, a security vulnerability CVE-2022-32149 was noted for Service Binding Operator. This update fixes the CVE-2022-32149 error and updates the golang.org/x/text package from v0.3.7 to v0.3.8. APPSVC-1220

# Release notes for Service Binding Operator 1.3

Service Binding Operator 1.3 is now available on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.9, 4.10, and 4.11.

## Removed functionality

* In Service Binding Operator 1.3, the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) descriptor feature has been removed to improve resource utilization. As an alternative to OLM descriptors, you can use CRD annotations to declare binding data.

# Release notes for Service Binding Operator 1.2

Service Binding Operator 1.2 is now available on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 4.10, and 4.11.

## New features

This section highlights what is new in Service Binding Operator 1.2:

* Enable Service Binding Operator to consider optional fields in the annotations by setting the optional flag value to true.
* Support for servicebinding.io/v1beta1 resources.
* Improvements to the discoverability of bindable services by exposing the relevant binding secret without requiring a workload to be present.

## Known issues

* Currently, when you install Service Binding Operator on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.11, the memory footprint of Service Binding Operator increases beyond expected limits. With low usage, however, the memory footprint stays within the expected ranges of your environment or scenarios. In comparison with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.10, under stress, both the average and maximum memory footprint increase considerably. This issue is evident in the previous versions of Service Binding Operator as well. There is currently no workaround for this issue. APPSVC-1200
* By default, the projected files get their permissions set to 0644. Service Binding Operator cannot set specific permissions due to a bug in Kubernetes that causes issues if the service expects specific permissions such as, 0600. As a workaround, you can modify the code of the program or the application that is running inside a workload resource to copy the file to the /tmp directory and set the appropriate permissions. APPSVC-1127
* There is currently a known issue with installing Service Binding Operator in a single namespace installation mode. The absence of an appropriate namespace-scoped role-based access control (RBAC) rule prevents the successful binding of an application to a few known Operator-backed services that the Service Binding Operator can automatically detect and bind to. When this happens, it generates an error message similar to the following example:
Example error message

```text
`postgresclusters.postgres-operator.crunchydata.com "hippo" is forbidden:
        User "system:serviceaccount:my-petclinic:service-binding-operator" cannot
        get resource "postgresclusters" in API group "postgres-operator.crunchydata.com"
        in the namespace "my-petclinic"`
```


Workaround 1: Install the Service Binding Operator in the all namespaces installation mode. As a result, the appropriate cluster-scoped RBAC rule now exists and the binding succeeds.

Workaround 2: If you cannot install the Service Binding Operator in the all namespaces installation mode, install the following role binding into the namespace where the Service Binding Operator is installed:
Example: Role binding for Crunchy Postgres Operator

```yaml
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: service-binding-crunchy-postgres-viewer
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: service-binding-operator
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: service-binding-crunchy-postgres-viewer-role
```


APPSVC-1062
* According to the specification, when you change the ClusterWorkloadResourceMapping resources, Service Binding Operator must use the previous version of the ClusterWorkloadResourceMapping resource to remove the binding data that was being projected until now. Currently, when you change the ClusterWorkloadResourceMapping resources, the Service Binding Operator uses the latest version of the ClusterWorkloadResourceMapping resource to remove the binding data. As a result, {the servicebinding-title} might remove the binding data incorrectly. As a workaround, perform the following steps:
1. Delete any ServiceBinding resources that use the corresponding ClusterWorkloadResourceMapping resource.
2. Modify the ClusterWorkloadResourceMapping resource.
3. Re-apply the ServiceBinding resources that you previously removed in step 1.

APPSVC-1102

# Release notes for Service Binding Operator 1.1.1

Service Binding Operator 1.1.1 is now available on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, and 4.10.

## Fixed issues

* Before this update, a security vulnerability CVE-2021-38561 was noted for Service Binding Operator Helm chart. This update fixes the CVE-2021-38561 error and updates the golang.org/x/text package from v0.3.6 to v0.3.7. APPSVC-1124
* Before this update, users of the Developer Sandbox did not have sufficient permissions to read ClusterWorkloadResourceMapping resources. As a result, Service Binding Operator prevented all service bindings from being successful. With this update, the Service Binding Operator now includes the appropriate role-based access control (RBAC) rules for any authenticated subject including the Developer Sandbox users. These RBAC rules allow the Service Binding Operator to get, list, and watch the ClusterWorkloadResourceMapping resources for the Developer Sandbox users and to process service bindings successfully. APPSVC-1135

## Known issues

* There is currently a known issue with installing Service Binding Operator in a single namespace installation mode. The absence of an appropriate namespace-scoped role-based access control (RBAC) rule prevents the successful binding of an application to a few known Operator-backed services that the Service Binding Operator can automatically detect and bind to. When this happens, it generates an error message similar to the following example:
Example error message

```text
`postgresclusters.postgres-operator.crunchydata.com "hippo" is forbidden:
        User "system:serviceaccount:my-petclinic:service-binding-operator" cannot
        get resource "postgresclusters" in API group "postgres-operator.crunchydata.com"
        in the namespace "my-petclinic"`
```


Workaround 1: Install the Service Binding Operator in the all namespaces installation mode. As a result, the appropriate cluster-scoped RBAC rule now exists and the binding succeeds.

Workaround 2: If you cannot install the Service Binding Operator in the all namespaces installation mode, install the following role binding into the namespace where the Service Binding Operator is installed:
Example: Role binding for Crunchy Postgres Operator

subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: service-binding-operator
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: service-binding-crunchy-postgres-viewer-role
```


APPSVC-1062
* Currently, when you modify the ClusterWorkloadResourceMapping resources, the Service Binding Operator does not implement correct behavior. As a workaround, perform the following steps:
1. Delete any ServiceBinding resources that use the corresponding ClusterWorkloadResourceMapping resource.
2. Modify the ClusterWorkloadResourceMapping resource.
3. Re-apply the ServiceBinding resources that you previously removed in step 1.

# Release notes for Service Binding Operator 1.1

Service Binding Operator is now available on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, and 4.10.

## New features

This section highlights what is new in Service Binding Operator 1.1:

* Service Binding Options
* Workload resource mapping: Define exactly where binding data needs to be projected for the secondary workloads.
* Bind new workloads using a label selector.

## Fixed issues

* Before this update, service bindings that used label selectors to pick up workloads did not project service binding data into the new workloads that matched the given label selectors. As a result, the Service Binding Operator could not periodically bind such new workloads. With this update, service bindings now project service binding data into the new workloads that match the given label selector. The Service Binding Operator now periodically attempts to find and bind such new workloads. APPSVC-1083

## Known issues

* There is currently a known issue with installing Service Binding Operator in a single namespace installation mode. The absence of an appropriate namespace-scoped role-based access control (RBAC) rule prevents the successful binding of an application to a few known Operator-backed services that the Service Binding Operator can automatically detect and bind to. When this happens, it generates an error message similar to the following example:
Example error message

```text
`postgresclusters.postgres-operator.crunchydata.com "hippo" is forbidden:
        User "system:serviceaccount:my-petclinic:service-binding-operator" cannot
        get resource "postgresclusters" in API group "postgres-operator.crunchydata.com"
        in the namespace "my-petclinic"`
```


Workaround 1: Install the Service Binding Operator in the all namespaces installation mode. As a result, the appropriate cluster-scoped RBAC rule now exists and the binding succeeds.

Workaround 2: If you cannot install the Service Binding Operator in the all namespaces installation mode, install the following role binding into the namespace where the Service Binding Operator is installed:

Some features in this release are currently in Technology Preview. These experimental features are not intended for production use.

Technology Preview Features Support Scope

In the table below, features are marked with the following statuses:

* TP: Technology Preview
* GA: General Availability

Note the following scope of support on the Red Hat Customer Portal for these features:



## Fixed issues

* Before this update, binding the data values from a Cluster custom resource (CR) of the postgresql.k8s.enterpriesedb.io/v1 API collected the host binding value from the .metadata.name field of the CR. The collected binding value is an incorrect hostname and the correct hostname is available at the .status.writeService field. With this update, the annotations that the Service Binding Operator uses to expose the binding data values from the backing service CR are now modified to collect the host binding value from the .status.writeService field. The Service Binding Operator uses these modified annotations to project the correct hostname in the host and provider bindings. APPSVC-1040
* Before this update, when you would bind a PostgresCluster CR of the postgres-operator.crunchydata.com/v1beta1 API, the binding data values did not include the values for the database certificates. As a result, the application failed to connect to the database. With this update, modifications to the annotations that the Service Binding Operator uses to expose the binding data from the backing service CR now include the database certificates. The Service Binding Operator uses these modified annotations to project the correct ca.crt, tls.crt, and tls.key certificate files. APPSVC-1045
* Before this update, when you would bind a PerconaXtraDBCluster custom resource (CR) of the pxc.percona.com API, the binding data values did not include the port and database values. These binding values along with the others already projected are necessary for an application to successfully connect to the database service. With this update, the annotations that the Service Binding Operator uses to expose the binding data values from the backing service CR are now modified to project the additional port and database binding values. The Service Binding Operator uses these modified annotations to project the complete set of binding values that the application can use to successfully connect to the database service. APPSVC-1073

## Known issues

* Currently, when you install the Service Binding Operator in the single namespace installation mode, the absence of an appropriate namespace-scoped role-based access control (RBAC) rule prevents the successful binding of an application to a few known Operator-backed services that the Service Binding Operator can automatically detect and bind to. In addition, the following error message is generated:
Example error message

```
`postgresclusters.postgres-operator.crunchydata.com "hippo" is forbidden:
        User "system:serviceaccount:my-petclinic:service-binding-operator" cannot
        get resource "postgresclusters" in API group "postgres-operator.crunchydata.com"
        in the namespace "my-petclinic"`
```


Workaround 1: Install the Service Binding Operator in the all namespaces installation mode. As a result, the appropriate cluster-scoped RBAC rule now exists and the binding succeeds.
