Understanding Helm

Helm is a software package manager that simplifies deployment of applications and services to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters.

Helm uses a packaging format called charts. A Helm chart is a collection of files that describes the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform resources.

Creating a chart in a cluster creates a running instance of the chart known as a release.

Each time a chart is created, or a release is upgraded or rolled back, an incremental revision is created.
Key features
Helm provides the ability to:

Search through a large collection of charts stored in the chart repository.

Modify existing charts.

Create your own charts with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform or Kubernetes resources.

Package and share your applications as charts.
Red Hat Certification of Helm charts for OpenShift
You can choose to verify and certify your Helm charts by Red Hat for all the components you will be deploying on the Red Hat Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. Charts go through an automated Red Hat OpenShift certification workflow that guarantees security compliance as well as best integration and experience with the platform. Certification assures the integrity of the chart and ensures that the Helm chart works seamlessly on Red Hat OpenShift clusters.
