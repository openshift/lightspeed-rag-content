You can edit the configuration and the source code of the application you create using the Topology view.
Prerequisites

Editing the source code of an application using the Developer perspective

In the Topology view, click the Edit Source code icon, displayed at the bottom-right of the deployed application, to access your source code and modify it.
Editing the application configuration using the Developer perspective
You can use the Topology view in the Developer perspective to edit the configuration of your application.

Currently, only configurations of applications created by using the From Git, Container Image, From Catalog, or From Dockerfile options in the Add workflow of the Developer perspective can be edited. Configurations of applications created by using the CLI or the YAML option from the Add workflow cannot be edited.
