Cluster Network Operator in "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform"

The Cluster Network Operator (CNO) deploys and manages the cluster network components on an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster, including the Container Network Interface (CNI) network plugin selected for the cluster during installation.
Cluster Network Operator
The Cluster Network Operator implements the network API from the operator.openshift.io API group. The Operator deploys the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, or the network provider plugin that you selected during cluster installation, by using a daemon set.

The Cluster Network Operator is deployed during installation as a Kubernetes Deployment.

Run the following command to view the Deployment status:

Viewing the cluster network configuration
Every new "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation has a network.config object named cluster.

Use the oc describe command to view the cluster network configuration:
Viewing Cluster Network Operator status
You can inspect the status and view the details of the Cluster Network Operator using the oc describe command.

Run the following command to view the status of the Cluster Network Operator:
Viewing Cluster Network Operator logs
You can view Cluster Network Operator logs by using the oc logs command.

Cluster Network Operator configuration
The configuration for the cluster network is specified as part of the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) configuration and stored in a custom resource (CR) object that is named cluster. The CR specifies the fields for the Network API in the operator.openshift.io API group.

The CNO configuration inherits the following fields during cluster installation from the Network API in the Network.config.openshift.io API group:


clusterNetwork
IP address pools from which pod IP addresses are allocated.
serviceNetwork
IP address pool for services.
defaultNetwork.type
Cluster network plugin. OVNKubernetes is the only supported plugin during installation.


After cluster installation, you can only modify the clusterNetwork IP address range. The default network type can only be changed from OpenShift SDN to OVN-Kubernetes through migration.
You can specify the cluster network plugin configuration for your cluster by setting the fields for the defaultNetwork object in the CNO object named cluster.

Cluster Network Operator configuration object
The fields for the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) are described in the following table:



The values for the defaultNetwork object are defined in the following table:



The following table describes the configuration fields for the OpenShift SDN network plugin:


defaultNetwork:
  type: OpenShiftSDN
  openshiftSDNConfig:
    mode: NetworkPolicy
    mtu: 1450
    vxlanPort: 4789

The following table describes the configuration fields for the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin:





You can only change the configuration for your cluster network plugin during cluster installation, except for the gatewayConfig field that can be changed at runtime as a postinstallation activity.
defaultNetwork:
  type: OVNKubernetes
  ovnKubernetesConfig:
    mtu: 1400
    genevePort: 6081
      ipsecConfig:
        mode: Full
Using OVNKubernetes can lead to a stack exhaustion problem on IBM Power&#174;.

The values for the kubeProxyConfig object are defined in the following table:
Cluster Network Operator example configuration
A complete CNO configuration is specified in the following example:

apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1

  name: cluster
spec:
  clusterNetwork:
  - cidr: 10.128.0.0/14
