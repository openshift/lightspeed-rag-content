Defining a default network policy for projects

As a cluster administrator, you can modify the new project template to automatically include network policies when you create a new project. If you do not yet have a customized template for new projects, you must first create one.
Modifying the template for new projects
As a cluster administrator, you can modify the default project template so that new projects are created using your custom requirements.

To create your own custom project template:

You have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster using an account with cluster-admin permissions.


Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

Generate the default project template:

Use a text editor to modify the generated template.yaml file by adding
objects or modifying existing objects.

The project template must be created in the openshift-config namespace. Load
your modified template:

Edit the project configuration resource using the web console or CLI.

Update the spec section to include the projectRequestTemplate and name
parameters, and set the name of your uploaded project template. The default name
is project-request.

After you save your changes, create a new project to verify that your changes
were successfully applied.
Adding network policies to the new project template
As a cluster administrator, you can add network policies to the default template for new projects. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform will automatically create all the NetworkPolicy objects specified in the template in the project.

Your cluster uses a default CNI network plugin that supports NetworkPolicy objects, such as the OpenShift SDN network plugin with mode: NetworkPolicy set. This mode is the default for OpenShift SDN.

You installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You must log in to the cluster with a user with cluster-admin privileges.

You must have created a custom default project template for new projects.


Edit the default template for a new project by running the following command:

In the template, add each NetworkPolicy object as an element to the objects parameter. The objects parameter accepts a collection of one or more objects.

Optional: Create a new project to confirm that your network policy objects are created successfully by running the following commands:
