Editing a network policy

As a user with the admin role, you can edit an existing network policy for a namespace.
Editing a network policy
You can edit a network policy in a namespace.

If you log in with a user with the cluster-admin role, then you can edit a network policy in any namespace in the cluster.
Your cluster uses a network plugin that supports NetworkPolicy objects, such as the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin or the OpenShift SDN network plugin with mode: NetworkPolicy set. This mode is the default for OpenShift SDN.

You installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You are logged in to the cluster with a user with admin privileges.

You are working in the namespace where the network policy exists.


Optional: To list the network policy objects in a namespace, enter the following command:

Edit the network policy object.

Confirm that the network policy object is updated.


If you log in to the web console with cluster-admin privileges, you have a choice of editing a network policy in any namespace in the cluster directly in YAML or from the policy in the web console through the Actions menu.
Example NetworkPolicy object
The following annotates an example NetworkPolicy object:

kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-27107 1
spec:
  podSelector: 2
    matchLabels:
      app: mongodb
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector: 3
        matchLabels:
          app: app
    ports: 4
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 27017
The name of the NetworkPolicy object.

A selector that describes the pods to which the policy applies.
The policy object can only select pods in the project that defines the NetworkPolicy object.

A selector that matches the pods from which the policy object allows ingress traffic. The selector matches pods in the same namespace as the NetworkPolicy.

A list of one or more destination ports on which to accept traffic.
