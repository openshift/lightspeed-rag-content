Configuring interface-level network sysctl settings and all-multicast mode for SR-IOV networks

As a cluster administrator, you can change interface-level network sysctls and several interface attributes such as promiscuous mode, all-multicast mode, MTU, and MAC address by using the tuning Container Network Interface (CNI) meta plugin for a pod connected to a SR-IOV network device.
Labeling nodes with an SR-IOV enabled NIC
If you want to enable SR-IOV on only SR-IOV capable nodes there are a couple of ways to do this:

Install the Node Feature Discovery (NFD) Operator. NFD detects the presence of SR-IOV enabled NICs and labels the nodes with node.alpha.kubernetes-incubator.io/nfd-network-sriov.capable = true.

Examine the SriovNetworkNodeState CR for each node. The interfaces stanza includes a list of all of the SR-IOV devices discovered by the SR-IOV Network Operator on the worker node. Label each node with feature.node.kubernetes.io/network-sriov.capable: "true" by using the following command:
Setting one sysctl flag
You can set interface-level network sysctl settings for a pod connected to a SR-IOV network device.

In this example, net.ipv4.conf.IFNAME.accept_redirects is set to 1 on the created virtual interfaces.

The sysctl-tuning-test is a namespace used in this example.

Use the following command to create the sysctl-tuning-test namespace:


Setting one sysctl flag on nodes with SR-IOV network devices
The SR-IOV Network Operator adds the SriovNetworkNodePolicy.sriovnetwork.openshift.io custom resource definition (CRD) to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. You can configure an SR-IOV network device by creating a SriovNetworkNodePolicy custom resource (CR).

When applying the configuration specified in a SriovNetworkNodePolicy object, the SR-IOV Operator might drain and reboot the nodes.

It can take several minutes for a configuration change to apply.
Follow this procedure to create a SriovNetworkNodePolicy custom resource (CR).

Create an SriovNetworkNodePolicy custom resource (CR). For example, save the following YAML as the file policyoneflag-sriov-node-network.yaml:

Create the SriovNetworkNodePolicy object:

To verify that the SR-IOV network device is configured, enter the following command. Replace <node_name> with the name of a node with the SR-IOV network device that you just configured.
Configuring sysctl on a SR-IOV network
You can set interface specific sysctl settings on virtual interfaces created by SR-IOV by adding the tuning configuration to the optional metaPlugins parameter of the SriovNetwork resource.

The SR-IOV Network Operator manages additional network definitions. When you specify an additional SR-IOV network to create, the SR-IOV Network Operator creates the NetworkAttachmentDefinition custom resource (CR) automatically.

Do not edit NetworkAttachmentDefinition custom resources that the SR-IOV Network Operator manages. Doing so might disrupt network traffic on your additional network.
To change the interface-level network net.ipv4.conf.IFNAME.accept_redirects sysctl settings, create an additional SR-IOV network with the Container Network Interface (CNI) tuning plugin.

Install the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI (oc).

Log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.


Create the SriovNetwork custom resource (CR) for the additional SR-IOV network attachment and insert the metaPlugins configuration, as in the following example CR. Save the YAML as the file sriov-network-interface-sysctl.yaml.

Create the SriovNetwork resource:


Confirm that the SR-IOV Network Operator created the NetworkAttachmentDefinition CR by running the following command:


To verify that the tuning CNI is correctly configured and the additional SR-IOV network attachment is attached, do the following:

Create a Pod CR. Save the following YAML as the file examplepod.yaml:

Create the Pod CR:

Verify that the pod is created by running the following command:

Log in to the pod by running the following command:

Verify the values of the configured sysctl flag. Find the value  net.ipv4.conf.IFNAME.accept_redirects by running the following command::
Configuring sysctl settings for pods associated with bonded SR-IOV interface flag
You can set interface-level network sysctl settings for a pod connected to a bonded SR-IOV network device.

In this example, the specific network interface-level sysctl settings that can be configured are set on the bonded interface.

The sysctl-tuning-test is a namespace used in this example.

Use the following command to create the sysctl-tuning-test namespace:


Setting all sysctl flag on nodes with bonded SR-IOV network devices
The SR-IOV Network Operator adds the SriovNetworkNodePolicy.sriovnetwork.openshift.io custom resource definition (CRD) to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. You can configure an SR-IOV network device by creating a SriovNetworkNodePolicy custom resource (CR).

When applying the configuration specified in a SriovNetworkNodePolicy object, the SR-IOV Operator might drain the nodes, and in some cases, reboot nodes.

It might take several minutes for a configuration change to apply.
Follow this procedure to create a SriovNetworkNodePolicy custom resource (CR).

Create an SriovNetworkNodePolicy custom resource (CR). Save the following YAML as the file policyallflags-sriov-node-network.yaml. Replace policyallflags with the name for the configuration.

Create the SriovNetworkNodePolicy object:

To verify that the SR-IOV network device is configured, enter the following command. Replace <node_name> with the name of a node with the SR-IOV network device that you just configured.
Configuring sysctl on a bonded SR-IOV network
You can set interface specific sysctl settings on a bonded interface created from two SR-IOV interfaces. Do this by adding the tuning configuration to the optional Plugins parameter of the bond network attachment definition.

Do not edit NetworkAttachmentDefinition custom resources that the SR-IOV Network Operator manages. Doing so might disrupt network traffic on your additional network.
To change specific interface-level network sysctl settings create the SriovNetwork custom resource (CR)  with the Container Network Interface (CNI) tuning plugin by using the following procedure.

Install the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI (oc).

Log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.


Create the SriovNetwork custom resource (CR) for the bonded interface as in the following example CR. Save the YAML as the file sriov-network-attachment.yaml.

Create the SriovNetwork resource:

Create a bond network attachment definition as in the following example CR. Save the YAML as the file sriov-bond-network-interface.yaml.

Confirm that the SR-IOV Network Operator created the NetworkAttachmentDefinition CR by running the following command:


To verify that the tuning CNI is correctly configured and the additional SR-IOV network attachment is attached, do the following:

Create a Pod CR. For example, save the following YAML as the file examplepod.yaml:

Apply the YAML:

Verify that the pod is created by running the following command:

Log in to the pod by running the following command:

Verify the values of the configured sysctl flag. Find the value  net.ipv6.neigh.IFNAME.base_reachable_time_ms by running the following command::
About all-multicast mode
Enabling all-multicast mode, particularly in the context of rootless applications, is critical. If you do not enable this mode, you would be required to grant the NET_ADMIN capability to the pod's Security Context Constraints (SCC). If you were to allow the NET_ADMIN capability to grant the pod privileges to make changes that extend beyond its specific requirements, you could potentially expose security vulnerabilities.

The tuning CNI plugin supports changing several interface attributes, including all-multicast mode. By enabling this mode, you can allow applications running on Virtual Functions (VFs) that are configured on a SR-IOV network device to receive multicast traffic from applications on other VFs, whether attached to the same or different physical functions.

Enabling the all-multicast mode on an SR-IOV network
You can enable the all-multicast mode on an SR-IOV interface by:

Adding the tuning configuration to the metaPlugins parameter of the SriovNetwork resource

Setting the allmulti field to true in the tuning configuration


The SR-IOV Network Operator manages additional network definitions. When you specify an additional SR-IOV network to create, the SR-IOV Network Operator creates the NetworkAttachmentDefinition custom resource (CR) automatically.

Do not edit NetworkAttachmentDefinition custom resources that the SR-IOV Network Operator manages. Doing so might disrupt network traffic on your additional network.
