Using high performance multicast

You can use multicast on your Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) hardware network.
High performance multicast
The OpenShift SDN network plugin supports multicast between pods on the default network. This is best used for low-bandwidth coordination or service discovery, and not high-bandwidth applications. For applications such as streaming media, like Internet Protocol television (IPTV) and multipoint videoconferencing, you can utilize Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) hardware to provide near-native performance.

When using additional SR-IOV interfaces for multicast:

Multicast packages must be sent or received by a pod through the additional SR-IOV interface.

The physical network which connects the SR-IOV interfaces decides the
multicast routing and topology, which is not controlled by Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
Configuring an SR-IOV interface for multicast
The follow procedure creates an example SR-IOV interface for multicast.

Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You must log in to the cluster with a user that has the cluster-admin role.
