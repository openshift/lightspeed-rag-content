Using the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) on a bare metal cluster

As a cluster administrator, you can use the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) on a cluster.
Support for Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) on "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform"
As a cluster administrator, you can enable SCTP on the hosts in the cluster. On Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS), the SCTP module is disabled by default.

SCTP is a reliable message based protocol that runs on top of an IP network.

When enabled, you can use SCTP as a protocol with pods, services, and network policy. A Service object must be defined with the type parameter set to either the ClusterIP or NodePort value.

Example configurations using SCTP protocol
You can configure a pod or service to use SCTP by setting the protocol parameter to the SCTP value in the pod or service object.

In the following example, a pod is configured to use SCTP:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  namespace: project1
  name: example-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: example-pod
...
      ports:
        - containerPort: 30100
          name: sctpserver
          protocol: SCTP
In the following example, a service is configured to use SCTP:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  namespace: project1
  name: sctpserver
spec:
...
  ports:
    - name: sctpserver
      protocol: SCTP
      port: 30100
      targetPort: 30100
  type: ClusterIP
In the following example, a NetworkPolicy object is configured to apply to SCTP network traffic on port 80 from any pods with a specific label:

kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-sctp-on-http
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: web
  ingress:
  - ports:
    - protocol: SCTP
      port: 80
Enabling Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)
As a cluster administrator, you can load and enable the blacklisted SCTP kernel module on worker nodes in your cluster.

Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

Access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.


Create a file named load-sctp-module.yaml that contains the following YAML definition:

To create the MachineConfig object, enter the following command:

Optional: To watch the status of the nodes while the MachineConfig Operator applies the configuration change, enter the following command. When the status of a node transitions to Ready, the configuration update is applied.
Verifying Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is enabled
You can verify that SCTP is working on a cluster by creating a pod with an application that listens for SCTP traffic, associating it with a service, and then connecting to the exposed service.

Access to the internet from the cluster to install the nc package.

Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

Access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.


Create a pod starts an SCTP listener:

Create a service for the SCTP listener pod.

Create a pod for the SCTP client.

Run an SCTP listener on the server.

Connect to the SCTP listener on the server.
