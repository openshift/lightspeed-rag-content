Observing and updating the node network state and configuration

Viewing the network state of a node by using the CLI
Node network state is the network configuration for all nodes in the cluster. A NodeNetworkState object exists on every node in the cluster. This object is periodically updated and captures the state of the network for that node.

List all the NodeNetworkState objects in the cluster:

Inspect a NodeNetworkState object to view the network on that node. The output in this example has been redacted for clarity:
Viewing the network state of a node from the web console
As an administrator, you can use the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console to observe NodeNetworkState resources and network interfaces, and access network details.

Navigate to Networking → NodeNetworkState.

To access the detailed information about NodeNetworkState resource, click the NodeNetworkState resource name listed in the Name column .

to expand and view the Network Details section for the NodeNetworkState resource, click the > icon . Alternatively, you can click on each interface type under the Network interface column to view the network details.
Managing policy from the web console
You can update the node network configuration, such as adding or removing interfaces from nodes, by applying NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy manifests to the cluster. Manage the policy from the web console by accessing the list of created policies in the NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy page under the Networking menu. This page enables you to create, update, monitor, and delete the policies.

Monitoring the policy status
You can monitor the policy status from the NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy page. This page displays all the policies created in the cluster in a tabular format, with the following columns:


Name
The name of the policy created.
Matched nodes
The count of nodes where the policies are applied. This could be either a subset of nodes based on the node selector or all the nodes on the cluster.
Node network state
The enactment state of the matched nodes. You can click on the enactment state and view detailed information on the status.


To find the desired policy, you can filter the list either based on enactment state by using the Filter option, or by using the search option.
Creating a policy
You can create a policy by using either a form or YAML in the web console.

Navigate to Networking → NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy.

In the NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy page, click Create, and select From Form option.

Optional: Check the Apply this NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy only to specific subsets of nodes using the node selector checkbox to specify the nodes where the policy must be applied.

Enter the policy name in the Policy name field.

Optional: Enter the description of the policy in the Description field.

Optional: In the Policy Interface(s) section, a bridge interface is added by default with preset values in editable fields. Edit the values by executing the following steps:

Click Create to complete policy creation.
Updating the policy
Updating the policy by using form
Navigate to Networking → NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy.

In the NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy page, click the . icon placed next to the policy you want to edit, and click Edit.

Edit the fields that you want to update.

Click Save.


Addition of a VLAN interface using the form is not supported. To add a VLAN interface, you must use YAML to create the policy. Once added, you cannot edit the policy using form.
Updating the policy by using YAML
Navigate to Networking → NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy.

In the NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy page, click the policy name under the Name column for the policy you want to edit.

Click the YAML tab, and edit the YAML.

Click Save.
Deleting the policy
Navigate to Networking → NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy.

In the NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy page, click the . icon placed next to the policy you want to delete, and click Delete.

In the pop-up window, enter the policy name to confirm deletion, and click Delete.
Managing policy by using the CLI
Creating an interface on nodes
Create an interface on nodes in the cluster by applying a NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy manifest to the cluster. The manifest details the requested configuration for the interface.

By default, the manifest applies to all nodes in the cluster. To add the interface to specific nodes, add the spec: nodeSelector parameter and the appropriate <key>:<value> for your node selector.

You can configure multiple nmstate-enabled nodes concurrently. The configuration applies to 50% of the nodes in parallel. This strategy prevents the entire cluster from being unavailable if the network connection fails. To apply the policy configuration in parallel to a specific portion of the cluster, use the maxUnavailable field.

Create the NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy manifest. The following example configures a Linux bridge on all worker nodes and configures the DNS resolver:

Create the node network policy:



Example for creating multiple interfaces in the same policy

Examples of different IP management methods in policies
Confirming node network policy updates on nodes
A NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy manifest describes your requested network configuration for nodes in the cluster. The node network policy includes your requested network configuration and the status of execution of the policy on the cluster as a whole.

When you apply a node network policy, a NodeNetworkConfigurationEnactment object is created for every node in the cluster. The node network configuration enactment is a read-only object that represents the status of execution of the policy on that node. If the policy fails to be applied on the node, the enactment for that node includes a traceback for troubleshooting.

To confirm that a policy has been applied to the cluster, list the policies and their status:

Optional: If a policy is taking longer than expected to successfully configure, you can inspect the requested state and status conditions of a particular policy:

Optional: If a policy is taking longer than expected to successfully configure on all nodes, you can list the status of the enactments on the cluster:

Optional: To view the configuration of a particular enactment, including any error reporting for a failed configuration:
Removing an interface from nodes
You can remove an interface from one or more nodes in the cluster by editing the NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy object and setting the state of the interface to absent.

Removing an interface from a node does not automatically restore the node network configuration to a previous state. If you want to restore the previous state, you will need to define that node network configuration in the policy.

If you remove a bridge or bonding interface, any node NICs in the cluster that were previously attached or subordinate to that bridge or bonding interface are placed in a down state and become unreachable. To avoid losing connectivity, configure the node NIC in the same policy so that it has a status of up and either DHCP or a static IP address.

Deleting the node network policy that added an interface does not change the configuration of the policy on the node. Although a NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy is an object in the cluster, it only represents the requested configuration. Similarly, removing an interface does not delete the policy.
Update the NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy manifest used to create the interface. The following example removes a Linux bridge and configures the eth1 NIC with DHCP to avoid losing connectivity:

Update the policy on the node and remove the interface:
Example policy configurations for different interfaces
The following examples show different NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy manifest configurations.

For best performance, consider the following factors when applying a policy:

When you need to apply a policy to more than one node, create a NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy manifest for each target node. Scoping a policy to a single node reduces the overall length of time for the Kubernetes NMState Operator to apply the policies.

All related network configurations should be specified in a single policy.


Example: Linux bridge interface node network configuration policy
Create a Linux bridge interface on nodes in the cluster by applying a NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy manifest to the cluster.

The following YAML file is an example of a manifest for a Linux bridge interface. It includes samples values that you must replace with your own information.

apiVersion: nmstate.io/v1
kind: NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy
metadata:
  name: br1-eth1-policy 1
spec:
  nodeSelector: 2
    kubernetes.io/hostname: <node01> 3
  desiredState:
    interfaces:
      - name: br1 4
        description: Linux bridge with eth1 as a port 5
        type: linux-bridge 6
        state: up 7
        ipv4:
          dhcp: true 8
          enabled: true 9
        bridge:
          options:
            stp:
              enabled: false 10
          port:
            - name: eth1 11

Example: VLAN interface node network configuration policy
Create a VLAN interface on nodes in the cluster by applying a NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy manifest to the cluster.

Define all related configurations for the VLAN interface of a node in a single NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy manifest. For example, define the VLAN interface for a node and the related routes for the VLAN interface in the same NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy manifest.

When a node restarts, the Kubernetes NMState Operator cannot control the order in which policies are applied. Therefore, if you use separate policies for related network configurations, the Kubernetes NMState Operator might apply these policies in a sequence that results in a degraded network object.
The following YAML file is an example of a manifest for a VLAN interface. It includes samples values that you must replace with your own information.

apiVersion: nmstate.io/v1
kind: NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy

The NMPolicy project - Policy syntax
Examples: IP management
The following example configuration snippets demonstrate different methods of IP management.

These examples use the ethernet interface type to simplify the example while showing the related context in the policy configuration. These IP management examples can be used with the other interface types.

Static
The following snippet statically configures an IP address on the Ethernet interface:

# ...
    interfaces:
    - name: eth1
      description: static IP on eth1
      type: ethernet
      state: up
      ipv4:
        dhcp: false
        address:
        - ip: 192.168.122.250 1
          prefix-length: 24
        enabled: true
# ...
Replace this value with the static IP address for the interface.
No IP address
The following snippet ensures that the interface has no IP address:

# ...
    interfaces:
    - name: eth1
      description: No IP on eth1
      type: ethernet
      state: up
      ipv4:
        enabled: false
# ...
Dynamic host configuration
The following snippet configures an Ethernet interface that uses a dynamic IP address, gateway address, and DNS:

# ...
    interfaces:
    - name: eth1
      description: DHCP on eth1
      type: ethernet
      state: up
      ipv4:
        dhcp: true
        enabled: true
# ...
The following snippet configures an Ethernet interface that uses a dynamic IP address but does not use a dynamic gateway address or DNS:

# ...
    interfaces:
    - name: eth1
      description: DHCP without gateway or DNS on eth1
      type: ethernet
      state: up
      ipv4:
        dhcp: true
        auto-gateway: false
        auto-dns: false
        enabled: true
# ...
DNS
Setting the DNS configuration is analagous to modifying the /etc/resolv.conf file. The following snippet sets the DNS configuration on the host.

# ...
    interfaces: 1
       ...
       ipv4:
         ...
         auto-dns: false
         ...
    dns-resolver:
      config:
        search:
        - example.com
        - example.org
        server:
        - 8.8.8.8
# ...
You must configure an interface with auto-dns: false or you must use static IP configuration on an interface in order for Kubernetes NMState to store custom DNS settings.


You cannot use br-ex, an OVNKubernetes-managed Open vSwitch bridge, as the interface when configuring DNS resolvers.
Static routing
The following snippet configures a static route and a static IP on interface eth1.

# ...
    interfaces:
    - name: eth1
      description: Static routing on eth1
      type: ethernet
      state: up
      ipv4:
        dhcp: false
        address:
        - ip: 192.0.2.251 1
          prefix-length: 24
        enabled: true
    routes:
      config:
      - destination: 198.51.100.0/24
        metric: 150
        next-hop-address: 192.0.2.1 2
        next-hop-interface: eth1
        table-id: 254
# ...
The static IP address for the Ethernet interface.

Next hop address for the node traffic. This must be in the same subnet as the IP address set for the Ethernet interface.
