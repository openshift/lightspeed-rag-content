About the Kubernetes NMState Operator

The Kubernetes NMState Operator provides a Kubernetes API for performing state-driven network configuration across the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster's nodes with NMState. The Kubernetes NMState Operator provides users with functionality to configure various network interface types, DNS, and routing on cluster nodes. Additionally, the daemons on the cluster nodes periodically report on the state of each node's network interfaces to the API server.

Red Hat supports the Kubernetes NMState Operator in production environments on bare-metal, IBM Power(R), IBM Z(R), IBM(R) LinuxONE, VMware vSphere, and OpenStack installations.
Before you can use NMState with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, you must install the Kubernetes NMState Operator.

The Kubernetes NMState Operator updates the network configuration of a secondary NIC. It cannot update the network configuration of the primary NIC or the br-ex bridge.
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform uses nmstate to report on and configure the state of the node network. This makes it possible to modify the network policy configuration, such as by creating a Linux bridge on all nodes, by applying a single configuration manifest to the cluster.

Node networking is monitored and updated by the following objects:


NodeNetworkState
Reports the state of the network on that node.
NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy
Describes the requested network configuration on nodes. You update the node network configuration, including adding and removing interfaces, by applying a NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy manifest to the cluster.
NodeNetworkConfigurationEnactment
Reports the network policies enacted upon each node.
Installing the Kubernetes NMState Operator
You can install the Kubernetes NMState Operator by using the web console or the CLI.

Installing the Kubernetes NMState Operator by using the web console
You can install the Kubernetes NMState Operator by using the web console. After it is installed, the Operator can deploy the NMState State Controller as a daemon set across all of the cluster nodes.

You are logged in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.


Select Operators -> OperatorHub.

In the search field below All Items, enter nmstate and click Enter to search for the Kubernetes NMState Operator.

Click on the Kubernetes NMState Operator search result.

Click on Install to open the Install Operator window.

Click Install to install the Operator.

After the Operator finishes installing, click View Operator.

Under Provided APIs, click Create Instance to open the dialog box for creating an instance of kubernetes-nmstate.

In the Name field of the dialog box, ensure the name of the instance is nmstate.

Accept the default settings and click Create to create the instance.


Once complete, the Operator has deployed the NMState State Controller as a daemon set across all of the cluster nodes.
Installing the Kubernetes NMState Operator using the CLI
You can install the Kubernetes NMState Operator by using the OpenShift CLI (oc). After it is installed, the Operator can deploy the NMState State Controller as a daemon set across all of the cluster nodes.

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
