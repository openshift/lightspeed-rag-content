# Configuring MetalLB address pools


As a cluster administrator, you can add, modify, and delete address pools.
The MetalLB Operator uses the address pool custom resources to set the IP addresses that MetalLB can assign to services. The namespace used in the examples assume the namespace is metallb-system.

# About the IPAddressPool custom resource


[NOTE]
----
The address pool custom resource definition (CRD) and API documented in "Load balancing with MetalLB" in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 can still be used in 4.15. However, the enhanced functionality associated with advertising an IP address from an IPAddressPool with layer 2 protocols, or the BGP protocol, is not supported when using the AddressPool CRD.
----

The fields for the IPAddressPool custom resource are described in the following tables.



You can assign IP addresses from an IPAddressPool to services and namespaces by configuring the spec.serviceAllocation specification.



# Configuring an address pool

As a cluster administrator, you can add address pools to your cluster to control the IP addresses that MetalLB can assign to load-balancer services.

* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

1. Create a file, such as ipaddresspool.yaml, with content like the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  namespace: metallb-system
  name: doc-example
  labels: 1
    zone: east
spec:
  addresses:
  - 203.0.113.1-203.0.113.10
  - 203.0.113.65-203.0.113.75
# ...
```

This label assigned to the IPAddressPool can be referenced by the ipAddressPoolSelectors in the BGPAdvertisement CRD to associate the IPAddressPool with the advertisement.
2. Apply the configuration for the IP address pool:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f ipaddresspool.yaml
```


1. View the address pool by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc describe -n metallb-system IPAddressPool doc-example
```

Example output

```terminal
Name:         doc-example
Namespace:    metallb-system
Labels:       zone=east
Annotations:  <none>
API Version:  metallb.io/v1beta1
Kind:         IPAddressPool
Metadata:
  ...
Spec:
  Addresses:
    203.0.113.1-203.0.113.10
    203.0.113.65-203.0.113.75
  Auto Assign:  true
Events:         <none>
```

2. Confirm that the address pool name, such as doc-example, and the IP address ranges exist in the output.

# Configure MetalLB address pool for VLAN

As a cluster administrator, you can add address pools to your cluster to control the IP addresses on a created VLAN that MetalLB can assign to load-balancer services

* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* Configure a separate VLAN.
* Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

1. Create a file, such as ipaddresspool-vlan.yaml, that is similar to the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  namespace: metallb-system
  name: doc-example-vlan
  labels:
    zone: east 1
spec:
  addresses:
  - 192.168.100.1-192.168.100.254 2
```

This label assigned to the IPAddressPool can be referenced by the ipAddressPoolSelectors in the BGPAdvertisement CRD to associate the IPAddressPool with the advertisement.
This IP range must match the subnet assigned to the VLAN on your network. To support layer 2 (L2) mode, the IP address range must be within the same subnet as the cluster nodes.
2. Apply the configuration for the IP address pool:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f ipaddresspool-vlan.yaml
```

3. To ensure this configuration applies to the VLAN you need to set the spec gatewayConfig.ipForwarding to Global.
1. Run the following command to edit the network configuration custom resource (CR):

```terminal
$ oc edit network.operator.openshift/cluster
```

2. Update the spec.defaultNetwork.ovnKubernetesConfig section to include the gatewayConfig.ipForwarding set to Global. It should look something like this:
Example

```yaml
...
spec:
  clusterNetwork:
    - cidr: 10.128.0.0/14
      hostPrefix: 23
  defaultNetwork:
    type: OVNKubernetes
    ovnKubernetesConfig:
      gatewayConfig:
        ipForwarding: Global
...
```


# Example address pool configurations

The following examples show address pool configurations for specific scenarios.

## Example: IPv4 and CIDR ranges

You can specify a range of IP addresses in classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) notation. You can combine CIDR notation with the notation that uses a hyphen to separate lower and upper bounds.


```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  name: doc-example-cidr
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
  - 192.168.100.0/24
  - 192.168.200.0/24
  - 192.168.255.1-192.168.255.5
# ...
```


## Example: Assign IP addresses

You can set the autoAssign field to false to prevent MetalLB from automatically assigning IP addresses from the address pool. You can then assign a single IP address or multiple IP addresses from an IP address pool. To assign an IP address, append the /32 CIDR notation to the target IP address in the spec.addresses parameter. This setting ensures that only the specific IP address is avilable for assignment, leaving non-reserved IP addresses for application use.


```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  name: doc-example-reserved
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
  - 192.168.100.1/32
  - 192.168.200.1/32
  autoAssign: false
# ...
```



[NOTE]
----
When you add a service, you can request a specific IP address from the address pool or you can specify the pool name in an annotation to request any IP address from the pool.
----

## Example: IPv4 and IPv6 addresses

You can add address pools that use IPv4 and IPv6. You can specify multiple ranges in the addresses list, just like several IPv4 examples.

Whether the service is assigned a single IPv4 address, a single IPv6 address, or both is determined by how you add the service. The spec.ipFamilies and spec.ipFamilyPolicy fields control how IP addresses are assigned to the service.


```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  name: doc-example-combined
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
  - 10.0.100.0/28 1
  - 2002:2:2::1-2002:2:2::100
# ...
```


Where 10.0.100.0/28 is the local network IP address followed by the /28 network prefix.

## Example: Assign IP address pools to services or namespaces

You can assign IP addresses from an IPAddressPool to services and namespaces that you specify.

If you assign a service or namespace to more than one IP address pool, MetalLB uses an available IP address from the higher-priority IP address pool. If no IP addresses are available from the assigned IP address pools with a high priority, MetalLB uses available IP addresses from an IP address pool with lower priority or no priority.


[NOTE]
----
You can use the matchLabels label selector, the matchExpressions label selector, or both, for the namespaceSelectors and serviceSelectors specifications. This example demonstrates one label selector for each specification.
----


```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  name: doc-example-service-allocation
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
    - 192.168.20.0/24
  serviceAllocation:
    priority: 50 1
    namespaces: 2
      - namespace-a
      - namespace-b
    namespaceSelectors: 3
      - matchLabels:
          zone: east
    serviceSelectors: 4
      - matchExpressions:
        - key: security
          operator: In
          values:
          - S1
# ...
```


Assign a priority to the address pool. A lower number indicates a higher priority.
Assign one or more namespaces to the IP address pool in a list format.
Assign one or more namespace labels to the IP address pool by using label selectors in a list format.
Assign one or more service labels to the IP address pool by using label selectors in a list format.
