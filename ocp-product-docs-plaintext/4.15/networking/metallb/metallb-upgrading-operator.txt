Upgrading the MetalLB

If you are currently running version 4.10 or an earlier version of the MetalLB Operator, please note that automatic updates to any version later than 4.10 do not work. Upgrading to a newer version from any version of the MetalLB Operator that is 4.11 or later is successful. For example, upgrading from version 4.12 to version 4.13 will occur smoothly.

A summary of the upgrade procedure for the MetalLB Operator from 4.10 and earlier is as follows:

Delete the installed MetalLB Operator version for example 4.10. Ensure that the namespace and the metallb custom resource are not removed.

Using the CLI, install the MetalLB Operator 4.15 in the same namespace where the previous version of the MetalLB Operator was installed.


This procedure does not apply to automatic z-stream updates of the MetalLB Operator, which follow the standard straightforward method.
For detailed steps to upgrade the MetalLB Operator from 4.10 and earlier, see the guidance that follows. As a cluster administrator, start the upgrade process by deleting the MetalLB Operator by using the OpenShift CLI (oc) or the web console.
