Configuring ingress cluster traffic using a NodePort

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform provides methods for communicating from outside the cluster with services running in the cluster. This method uses a NodePort.
Using a NodePort to get traffic into the cluster
Use a NodePort-type Service resource to expose a service on a specific port on all nodes in the cluster. The port is specified in the Service resource's .spec.ports[*].nodePort field.

Using a node port requires additional port resources.
A NodePort exposes the service on a static port on the node's IP address. NodePorts are in the 30000 to 32767 range by default, which means a NodePort is unlikely to match a service's intended port. For example, port 8080 may be exposed as port 31020 on the node.

The administrator must ensure the external IP addresses are routed to the nodes.

NodePorts and external IPs are independent and both can be used concurrently.

The procedures in this section require prerequisites performed by the cluster administrator.
Prerequisites
Before starting the following procedures, the administrator must:

Set up the external port to the cluster networking environment so that requests
can reach the cluster.

Make sure there is at least one user with cluster admin role. To add this role
to a user, run the following command:

Have an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster with at least one master and at least one node
and a system outside the cluster that has network access to the cluster. This
procedure assumes that the external system is on the same subnet as the cluster.
The additional networking required for external systems on a different subnet is
out-of-scope for this topic.
Creating a project and service
If the project and service that you want to expose do not exist, first create the project, then the service.

If the project and service already exist, skip to the procedure on exposing the service to create a route.

Install the oc CLI and log in as a cluster administrator.


Create a new project for your service by running the oc new-project command:

Use the oc new-app command to create your service:

To verify that the service was created, run the following command:
Exposing the service by creating a route
You can expose the service as a route by using the oc expose command.

To expose the service:

Log in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

Log in to the project where the service you want to expose is located:

To expose a node port for the application, modify the custom resource definition (CRD) of a service by entering the following command:

Optional: To confirm the service is available with a node port exposed, enter the following command:

Optional: To remove the service created automatically by the oc new-app command, enter the following command:


To check that the service node port is updated with a port in the 30000-32767 range, enter the following command:
