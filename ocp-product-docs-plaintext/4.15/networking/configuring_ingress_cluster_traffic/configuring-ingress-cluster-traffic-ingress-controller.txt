Configuring ingress cluster traffic using an Ingress Controller

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform provides methods for communicating from outside the cluster with services running in the cluster. This method uses an Ingress Controller.
Creating a project and service
If the project and service that you want to expose do not exist, first create the project, then the service.

If the project and service already exist, skip to the procedure on exposing the service to create a route.

Install the oc CLI and log in as a cluster administrator.


Create a new project for your service by running the oc new-project command:

Use the oc new-app command to create your service:

To verify that the service was created, run the following command:
Exposing the service by creating a route
You can expose the service as a route by using the oc expose command.

To expose the service:

Log in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

Log in to the project where the service you want to expose is located:

Run the oc expose service command to expose the route:

To verify that the service is exposed, you can use a tool, such as cURL, to make sure the service is accessible from outside the cluster.
