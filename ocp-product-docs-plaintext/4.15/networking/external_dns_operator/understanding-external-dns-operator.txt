External DNS Operator domain name limitations
The External DNS Operator uses the TXT registry which adds the prefix for TXT records. This reduces the maximum length of the domain name for TXT records. A DNS record cannot be present without a corresponding TXT record, so the domain name of the DNS record must follow the same limit as the TXT records. For example, a DNS record of <domain_name_from_source> results in a TXT record of external-dns-<record_type>-<domain_name_from_source>.

The domain name of the DNS records generated by the External DNS Operator has the following limitations:


The following error appears in the External DNS Operator logs if the generated domain name exceeds any of the domain name limitations:
