About the OpenShift SDN network plugin

Part of Red Hat OpenShift Networking, OpenShift SDN is a network plugin that uses a software-defined networking (SDN) approach to provide a unified cluster network that enables communication between pods across the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster. This pod network is established and maintained by OpenShift SDN, which configures an overlay network using Open vSwitch (OVS).
