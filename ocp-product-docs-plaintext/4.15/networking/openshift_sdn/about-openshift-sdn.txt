About the OpenShift SDN network plugin

Part of Red Hat OpenShift Networking, OpenShift SDN is a network plugin that uses a software-defined networking (SDN) approach to provide a unified cluster network that enables communication between pods across the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. This pod network is established and maintained by OpenShift SDN, which configures an overlay network using Open vSwitch (OVS).

OpenShift SDN CNI is deprecated as of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14. As of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15, the network plugin is not an option for new installations. In a subsequent future release, the OpenShift SDN network plugin is planned to be removed and no longer supported. RedÂ Hat will provide bug fixes and support for this feature until it is removed, but this feature will no longer receive enhancements. As an alternative to OpenShift SDN CNI, you can use OVN Kubernetes CNI instead.
Supported network plugin feature matrix
Red Hat OpenShift Networking offers two options for the network plugin, OpenShift SDN and OVN-Kubernetes, for the network plugin. The following table summarizes the current feature support for both network plugins:


Egress firewall is also known as egress network policy in OpenShift SDN. This is not the same as network policy egress.

Egress router for OVN-Kubernetes supports only redirect mode.

IPv6 is supported only on bare metal, vSphere, IBM Power(R), IBM Z(R), and Red Hat OpenStack clusters.

IPv6 single stack is not supported on IBM Power(R), IBM Z(R), and Red Hat OpenStack clusters.
