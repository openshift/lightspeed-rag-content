Removing an egress firewall from a project

As a cluster administrator, you can remove an egress firewall from a project to remove all restrictions on network traffic from the project that leaves the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster.

OpenShift SDN CNI is deprecated as of "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" 4.14. As of "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" 4.15, the network plugin is not an option for new installations. In a subsequent future release, the OpenShift SDN network plugin is planned to be removed and no longer supported. Red Hat will provide bug fixes and support for this feature until it is removed, but this feature will no longer receive enhancements. As an alternative to OpenShift SDN CNI, you can use OVN Kubernetes CNI instead.
