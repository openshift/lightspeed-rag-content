Configuring kube-proxy

The Kubernetes network proxy (kube-proxy) runs on each node and is managed by the Cluster Network Operator (CNO). kube-proxy maintains network rules for forwarding connections for endpoints associated with services.
About iptables rules synchronization
The synchronization period determines how frequently the Kubernetes network proxy (kube-proxy) syncs the iptables rules on a node.

A sync begins when either of the following events occurs:

An event occurs, such as service or endpoint is added to or removed from the
cluster.

The time since the last sync exceeds the sync period defined for kube-proxy.
kube-proxy configuration parameters
You can modify the following kubeProxyConfig parameters.

Because of performance improvements introduced in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.3 and greater, adjusting the iptablesSyncPeriod parameter is no longer necessary.
Modifying the kube-proxy configuration
You can modify the Kubernetes network proxy configuration for your cluster.

Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

Log in to a running cluster with the cluster-admin role.


Edit the Network.operator.openshift.io custom resource (CR) by running the
following command:

Modify the kubeProxyConfig parameter in the CR with your changes to the
kube-proxy configuration, such as in the following example CR:

Save the file and exit the text editor.

Enter the following command to confirm the configuration update:

Optional: Enter the following command to confirm that the Cluster Network
Operator accepted the configuration change:
