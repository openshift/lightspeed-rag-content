Configuring network isolation using OpenShift SDN

When your cluster is configured to use the multitenant isolation mode for the OpenShift SDN network plugin, each project is isolated by default. Network traffic is not allowed between pods or services in different projects in multitenant isolation mode.

You can change the behavior of multitenant isolation for a project in two ways:

You can join one or more projects, allowing network traffic between pods and
services in different projects.

You can disable network isolation for a project. It will be globally
accessible, accepting network traffic from pods and services in all other
projects. A globally accessible project can access pods and services in all
other projects.
Prerequisites
You must have a cluster configured to use the OpenShift SDN network plugin in multitenant isolation mode.
Joining projects
You can join two or more projects to allow network traffic between pods and services in different projects.

Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You must log in to the cluster with a user that has the cluster-admin role.


Use the following command to join projects to an existing project network:

Optional: Run the following command to view the pod networks that you have
joined together:
Isolating a project
You can isolate a project so that pods and services in other projects cannot access its pods and services.

Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You must log in to the cluster with a user that has the cluster-admin role.


To isolate the projects in the cluster, run the following command:
Disabling network isolation for a project
You can disable network isolation for a project.

Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You must log in to the cluster with a user that has the cluster-admin role.


Run the following command for the project:
