Editing an egress firewall for a project

As a cluster administrator, you can modify network traffic rules for an existing egress firewall.

OpenShift SDN CNI is deprecated as of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14. As of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15, the network plugin is not an option for new installations. In a subsequent future release, the OpenShift SDN network plugin is planned to be removed and no longer supported. RedÂ Hat will provide bug fixes and support for this feature until it is removed, but this feature will no longer receive enhancements. As an alternative to OpenShift SDN CNI, you can use OVN Kubernetes CNI instead.
