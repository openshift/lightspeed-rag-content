Configuring multi-network policy

As a cluster administrator, you can configure multi-network for additional networks. You can specify multi-network policy for SR-IOV, macvlan, and OVN-Kubernetes additional networks. Macvlan additional networks are fully supported. Other types of additional networks, such as ipvlan, are not supported.

Support for configuring multi-network policies for SR-IOV additional networks is a Technology Preview feature and is only supported with kernel network interface cards (NICs). SR-IOV is not supported for Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) applications.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
Differences between multi-network policy and network policy
Although the MultiNetworkPolicy API implements the NetworkPolicy API, there are several important differences:

You must use the MultiNetworkPolicy API:

You must use the multi-networkpolicy resource name when using the CLI to interact with multi-network policies. For example, you can view a multi-network policy object with the oc get multi-networkpolicy <name> command where <name> is the name of a multi-network policy.

You must specify an annotation with the name of the network attachment definition that defines the macvlan or SR-IOV additional network:
Enabling multi-network policy for the cluster
As a cluster administrator, you can enable multi-network policy support on your cluster.

Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

Log in to the cluster with a user with cluster-admin privileges.


Create the multinetwork-enable-patch.yaml file with the following YAML:

Configure the cluster to enable multi-network policy:
Supporting multi-network policies in IPv6 networks
The ICMPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) is a set of messages and processes that enable devices to discover and maintain information about neighboring nodes. NDP plays a crucial role in IPv6 networks, facilitating the interaction between devices on the same link.

The Cluster Network Operator (CNO) deploys the iptables implementation of multi-network policy when the useMultiNetworkPolicy parameter is set to true.

To support multi-network policies in IPv6 networks the Cluster Network Operator deploys the following set of rules in every pod affected by a multi-network policy:

kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: multi-networkpolicy-custom-rules
  namespace: openshift-multus
data:

  custom-v6-rules.txt: |
    # accept NDP
    -p icmpv6 --icmpv6-type neighbor-solicitation -j ACCEPT 1
    -p icmpv6 --icmpv6-type neighbor-advertisement -j ACCEPT 2
    # accept RA/RS
    -p icmpv6 --icmpv6-type router-solicitation -j ACCEPT 3
    -p icmpv6 --icmpv6-type router-advertisement -j ACCEPT 4
This rule allows incoming ICMPv6 neighbor solicitation messages, which are part of the neighbor discovery protocol (NDP). These messages help determine the link-layer addresses of neighboring nodes.

This rule allows incoming ICMPv6 neighbor advertisement messages, which are part of NDP and provide information about the link-layer address of the sender.

This rule permits incoming ICMPv6 router solicitation messages. Hosts use these messages to request router configuration information.

This rule allows incoming ICMPv6 router advertisement messages, which give configuration information to hosts.


You cannot edit these predefined rules.
These rules collectively enable essential ICMPv6 traffic for correct network functioning, including address resolution and router communication in an IPv6 environment. With these rules in place and a multi-network policy denying traffic, applications are not expected to experience connectivity issues.
Working with multi-network policy
As a cluster administrator, you can create, edit, view, and delete multi-network policies.

Prerequisites
You have enabled multi-network policy support for your cluster.
Creating a multi-network policy using the CLI
To define granular rules describing ingress or egress network traffic allowed for namespaces in your cluster, you can create a multi-network policy.

Your cluster uses a network plugin that supports NetworkPolicy objects, such as the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin or the OpenShift SDN network plugin with mode: NetworkPolicy set. This mode is the default for OpenShift SDN.

You installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You are logged in to the cluster with a user with cluster-admin privileges.

You are working in the namespace that the multi-network policy applies to.


Create a policy rule:

To create the multi-network policy object, enter the following command:


If you log in to the web console with cluster-admin privileges, you have a choice of creating a network policy in any namespace in the cluster directly in YAML or from a form in the web console.
Editing a multi-network policy
You can edit a multi-network policy in a namespace.

Your cluster uses a network plugin that supports NetworkPolicy objects, such as the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin or the OpenShift SDN network plugin with mode: NetworkPolicy set. This mode is the default for OpenShift SDN.

You are logged in to the cluster with a user with cluster-admin privileges.

You are working in the namespace where the multi-network policy exists.


Optional: To list the multi-network policy objects in a namespace, enter the following command:

Edit the multi-network policy object.

Confirm that the multi-network policy object is updated.


If you log in to the web console with cluster-admin privileges, you have a choice of editing a network policy in any namespace in the cluster directly in YAML or from the policy in the web console through the Actions menu.
Viewing multi-network policies using the CLI
You can examine the multi-network policies in a namespace.

Creating a default deny all multi-network policy
This is a fundamental policy, blocking all cross-pod networking other than network traffic allowed by the configuration of other deployed network policies. This procedure enforces a default deny-by-default policy.

If you log in with a user with the cluster-admin role, then you can create a network policy in any namespace in the cluster.
