Ingress Node Firewall Operator in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

The Ingress Node Firewall Operator allows administrators to manage firewall configurations at the node level.
Ingress Node Firewall Operator
The Ingress Node Firewall Operator provides ingress firewall rules at a node level by deploying the daemon set to nodes you specify and manage in the firewall configurations. To deploy the daemon set, you create an IngressNodeFirewallConfig custom resource (CR). The Operator applies the IngressNodeFirewallConfig CR to create ingress node firewall daemon set daemon, which run on all nodes that match the nodeSelector.

You configure rules of the IngressNodeFirewall CR and apply them to clusters using the nodeSelector and setting values to "true".

The Ingress Node Firewall Operator supports only stateless firewall rules.

Network interface controllers (NICs) that do not support native XDP drivers will run at a lower performance.

For Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14 or later, you must run Ingress Node Firewall Operator on RHEL 9.0 or later.

Ingress Node Firewall Operator is not supported on Amazon Web Services (AWS) with the default OpenShift installation or on Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA). For more information on Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS support and ingress, see Ingress Operator in Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS.

Deploying Ingress Node Firewall Operator
The Ingress Node Firewall Operator is installed.


To deploy the Ingress Node Firewall Operator, create a IngressNodeFirewallConfig custom resource that will deploy the Operator's daemon set. You can deploy one or multiple IngressNodeFirewall CRDs to nodes by applying firewall rules.

Create the IngressNodeFirewallConfig inside the openshift-ingress-node-firewall namespace named ingressnodefirewallconfig.

Run the following command to deploy Ingress Node Firewall Operator rules:


Ingress Node Firewall configuration object
The fields for the Ingress Node Firewall configuration object are described in the following table:


The Operator consumes the CR and creates an ingress node firewall daemon set on all the nodes that match the nodeSelector.

A complete Ingress Node Firewall Configuration is specified in the following example:

apiVersion: ingressnodefirewall.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: IngressNodeFirewallConfig
metadata:
  name: ingressnodefirewallconfig
  namespace: openshift-ingress-node-firewall
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ""
The Operator consumes the CR and creates an ingress node firewall daemon set on all the nodes that match the nodeSelector.
Ingress Node Firewall rules object
The fields for the Ingress Node Firewall rules object are described in the following table:



The values for the ingress object are defined in the following table:



A complete Ingress Node Firewall configuration is specified in the following example:

apiVersion: ingressnodefirewall.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: IngressNodeFirewall
metadata:
  name: ingressnodefirewall
spec:
  interfaces:
  - eth0
  nodeSelector:
    matchLabels:
      <ingress_firewall_label_name>: <label_value> 1
  ingress:
  - sourceCIDRs:
       - 172.16.0.0/12
    rules:
    - order: 10
      protocolConfig:
        protocol: ICMP
        icmp:
          icmpType: 8 #ICMP Echo request
      action: Deny
    - order: 20
      protocolConfig:
        protocol: TCP
        tcp:
          ports: "8000-9000"
      action: Deny
  - sourceCIDRs:
       - fc00:f853:ccd:e793::0/64
    rules:
    - order: 10
      protocolConfig:
        protocol: ICMPv6
        icmpv6:
          icmpType: 128 #ICMPV6 Echo request
      action: Deny
A <label_name> and a <label_value> must exist on the node and must match the nodeselector label and value applied to the nodes you want the ingressfirewallconfig CR to run on. The <label_value> can be true or false. By using nodeSelector labels, you can target separate groups of nodes to apply different rules to using the ingressfirewallconfig CR.



Zero trust Ingress Node Firewall rules can provide additional security to multi-interface clusters. For example, you can use zero trust Ingress Node Firewall rules to drop all traffic on a specific interface except for SSH.

A complete configuration of a zero trust Ingress Node Firewall rule set is specified in the following example:

Users need to add all ports their application will use to their allowlist in the following case to ensure proper functionality.
apiVersion: ingressnodefirewall.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: IngressNodeFirewall
metadata:
 name: ingressnodefirewall-zero-trust
spec:
 interfaces:
 - eth1 1
 nodeSelector:
   matchLabels:
     <ingress_firewall_label_name>: <label_value> 2
 ingress:
 - sourceCIDRs:
      - 0.0.0.0/0 3
   rules:
   - order: 10
     protocolConfig:
       protocol: TCP
       tcp:
         ports: 22
     action: Allow
   - order: 20
     action: Deny 4
Network-interface cluster

The <label_name> and <label_value> needs to match the nodeSelector label and value applied to the specific nodes with which you wish to apply the ingressfirewallconfig CR.

0.0.0.0/0 set to match any CIDR

action set to Deny
