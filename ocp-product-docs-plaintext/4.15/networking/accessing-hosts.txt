Accessing hosts

Learn how to create a bastion host to access Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform instances and access the control plane nodes with secure shell (SSH) access.
Accessing hosts on Amazon Web Services in an installer-provisioned infrastructure cluster
The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installer does not create any public IP addresses for any of the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances that it provisions for your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. To be able to SSH to your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform hosts, you must follow this procedure.

Create a security group that allows SSH access into the virtual private cloud
(VPC) created by the openshift-install command.

Create an Amazon EC2 instance on one of the public subnets the installer
created.

Associate a public IP address with the Amazon EC2 instance that you created.

After you provisioned your Amazon EC2 instance and can SSH into it, you must add
the SSH key that you associated with your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation. This key
can be different from the key for the bastion instance, but does not have to be.

Run oc get nodes, inspect the output, and choose one of the nodes that is a
master. The hostname looks similar to ip-10-0-1-163.ec2.internal.

From the bastion SSH host you manually deployed into Amazon EC2, SSH into that
control plane host. Ensure that you use the same SSH key you specified during the
installation:
