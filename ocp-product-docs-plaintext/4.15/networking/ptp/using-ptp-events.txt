# Using the PTP hardware fast event notifications framework


Cloud native applications such as virtual RAN (vRAN) require access to notifications about hardware timing events that are critical to the functioning of the overall network.
Precision Time Protocol (PTP) clock synchronization errors can negatively affect the performance and reliability of your low-latency application, for example, a vRAN application running in a distributed unit (DU).

# About PTP and clock synchronization error events

Loss of PTP synchronization is a critical error for a RAN network. If synchronization is lost on a node, the radio might be shut down and the network Over the Air (OTA) traffic might be shifted to another node in the wireless network. Fast event notifications mitigate against workload errors by allowing cluster nodes to communicate PTP clock sync status to the vRAN application running in the DU.

Event notifications are available to vRAN applications running on the same DU node. A publish/subscribe REST API passes events notifications to the messaging bus. Publish/subscribe messaging, or pub-sub messaging, is an asynchronous service-to-service communication architecture where any message published to a topic is immediately received by all of the subscribers to the topic.

The PTP Operator generates fast event notifications for every PTP-capable network interface. You can access the events by using a cloud-event-proxy sidecar container over an HTTP or Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) message bus.


[NOTE]
----
PTP fast event notifications are available for network interfaces configured to use PTP ordinary clocks, PTP grandmaster clocks, or PTP boundary clocks.

[NOTE]

HTTP transport is the default transport for PTP and bare-metal events.
Use HTTP transport instead of AMQP for PTP and bare-metal events where possible.

# About the PTP fast event notifications framework

Use the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) fast event notifications framework to subscribe cluster applications to PTP events that the bare-metal cluster node generates.


[NOTE]
----
The fast events notifications framework uses a REST API for communication. The REST API is based on the O-RAN O-Cloud Notification API Specification for Event Consumers 3.0 that is available from O-RAN ALLIANCE Specifications.
----

The framework consists of a publisher, subscriber, and an AMQ or HTTP messaging protocol to handle communications between the publisher and subscriber applications.
Applications run the cloud-event-proxy container in a sidecar pattern to subscribe to PTP events.
The cloud-event-proxy sidecar container can access the same resources as the primary application container without using any of the resources of the primary application and with no significant latency.

![Overview of PTP fast events]

 Event is generated on the cluster host:: linuxptp-daemon in the PTP Operator-managed pod runs as a Kubernetes DaemonSet and manages the various linuxptp processes (ptp4l, phc2sys, and optionally for grandmaster clocks, ts2phc).
The linuxptp-daemon passes the event to the UNIX domain socket.
 Event is passed to the cloud-event-proxy sidecar:: The PTP plugin reads the event from the UNIX domain socket and passes it to the cloud-event-proxy sidecar in the PTP Operator-managed pod.
cloud-event-proxy delivers the event from the Kubernetes infrastructure to Cloud-Native Network Functions (CNFs) with low latency.
 Event is persisted:: The cloud-event-proxy sidecar in the PTP Operator-managed pod processes the event and publishes the cloud-native event by using a REST API.
 Message is transported:: The message transporter transports the event to the cloud-event-proxy sidecar in the application pod over HTTP or AMQP 1.0 QPID.
 Event is available from the REST API:: The cloud-event-proxy sidecar in the Application pod processes the event and makes it available by using the REST API.
 Consumer application requests a subscription and receives the subscribed event:: The consumer application sends an API request to the cloud-event-proxy sidecar in the application pod to create a PTP events subscription.
The cloud-event-proxy sidecar creates an AMQ or HTTP messaging listener protocol for the resource specified in the subscription.

The cloud-event-proxy sidecar in the application pod receives the event from the PTP Operator-managed pod, unwraps the cloud events object to retrieve the data, and posts the event to the consumer application.
The consumer application listens to the address specified in the resource qualifier and receives and processes the PTP event.

# Configuring the PTP fast event notifications publisher

To start using PTP fast event notifications for a network interface in your cluster, you must enable the fast event publisher in the PTP Operator PtpOperatorConfig custom resource (CR) and configure ptpClockThreshold values in a PtpConfig CR that you create.

* You have installed the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI (oc).
* You have logged in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* You have installed the PTP Operator.

1. Modify the default PTP Operator config to enable PTP fast events.
1. Save the following YAML in the ptp-operatorconfig.yaml file:

```yaml
apiVersion: ptp.openshift.io/v1
kind: PtpOperatorConfig
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: openshift-ptp
spec:
  daemonNodeSelector:
    node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ""
  ptpEventConfig:
    enableEventPublisher: true 1
```

Set enableEventPublisher to true to enable PTP fast event notifications.

[NOTE]
----
In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.13 or later, you do not need to set the spec.ptpEventConfig.transportHost field in the PtpOperatorConfig resource when you use HTTP transport for PTP events.
Set transportHost only when you use AMQP transport for PTP events.
----
1. Update the PtpOperatorConfig CR:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f ptp-operatorconfig.yaml
```

2. Create a PtpConfig custom resource (CR) for the PTP enabled interface, and set the required values for ptpClockThreshold and ptp4lOpts.
The following YAML illustrates the required values that you must set in the PtpConfig CR:

```yaml
spec:
  profile:
  - name: "profile1"
    interface: "enp5s0f0"
    ptp4lOpts: "-2 -s --summary_interval -4" 1
    phc2sysOpts: "-a -r -m -n 24 -N 8 -R 16" 2
    ptp4lConf: "" 3
    ptpClockThreshold: 4
      holdOverTimeout: 5
      maxOffsetThreshold: 100
      minOffsetThreshold: -100
```

Append --summary_interval -4 to use PTP fast events.
Required phc2sysOpts values. -m prints messages to stdout. The linuxptp-daemon DaemonSet parses the logs and generates Prometheus metrics.
Specify a string that contains the configuration to replace the default /etc/ptp4l.conf file. To use the default configuration, leave the field empty.
Optional. If the ptpClockThreshold stanza is not present, default values are used for the ptpClockThreshold fields. The stanza shows default ptpClockThreshold values. The ptpClockThreshold values configure how long after the PTP master clock is disconnected before PTP events are triggered. holdOverTimeout is the time value in seconds before the PTP clock event state changes to FREERUN when the PTP master clock is disconnected. The maxOffsetThreshold and minOffsetThreshold settings configure offset values in nanoseconds that compare against the values for CLOCK_REALTIME (phc2sys) or master offset (ptp4l). When the ptp4l or phc2sys offset value is outside this range, the PTP clock state is set to FREERUN. When the offset value is within this range, the PTP clock state is set to LOCKED.

* For a complete example CR that configures linuxptp services as an ordinary clock with PTP fast events, see Configuring linuxptp services as ordinary clock.

# Migrating consumer applications to use HTTP transport for PTP or bare-metal events

If you have previously deployed PTP or bare-metal events consumer applications, you need to update the applications to use HTTP message transport.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have logged in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* You have updated the PTP Operator or Bare Metal Event Relay to version 4.13+ which uses HTTP transport by default.

1. Update your events consumer application to use HTTP transport.
Set the http-event-publishers variable for the cloud event sidecar deployment.

For example, in a cluster with PTP events configured, the following YAML snippet illustrates a cloud event sidecar deployment:

```yaml
containers:
  - name: cloud-event-sidecar
    image: cloud-event-sidecar
    args:
      - "--metrics-addr=127.0.0.1:9091"
      - "--store-path=/store"
      - "--transport-host=consumer-events-subscription-service.cloud-events.svc.cluster.local:9043"
      - "--http-event-publishers=ptp-event-publisher-service-NODE_NAME.openshift-ptp.svc.cluster.local:9043" 1
      - "--api-port=8089"
```

The PTP Operator automatically resolves NODE_NAME to the host that is generating the PTP events.
For example, compute-1.example.com.

In a cluster with bare-metal events configured, set the http-event-publishers field to hw-event-publisher-service.openshift-bare-metal-events.svc.cluster.local:9043 in the cloud event sidecar deployment CR.
2. Deploy the consumer-events-subscription-service service alongside the events consumer application.
For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  annotations:
    prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
    service.alpha.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name: sidecar-consumer-secret
  name: consumer-events-subscription-service
  namespace: cloud-events
  labels:
    app: consumer-service
spec:
  ports:
    - name: sub-port
      port: 9043
  selector:
    app: consumer
  clusterIP: None
  sessionAffinity: None
  type: ClusterIP
```


# Installing the AMQ messaging bus

To pass PTP fast event notifications between publisher and subscriber on a node, you can install and configure an AMQ messaging bus to run locally on the node.
To use AMQ messaging, you must install the AMQ Interconnect Operator.


[NOTE]
----
HTTP transport is the default transport for PTP and bare-metal events.
Use HTTP transport instead of AMQP for PTP and bare-metal events where possible.
AMQ Interconnect is EOL from 30 June 2024.
Extended life cycle support (ELS) for AMQ Interconnect ends 29 November 2029.
For more information see, Red Hat AMQ Interconnect support status.
----

* Install the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI (oc).
* Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

* Install the AMQ Interconnect Operator to its own amq-interconnect namespace. See Adding the Red Hat Integration - AMQ Interconnect Operator.

1. Check that the AMQ Interconnect Operator is available and the required pods are running:

```terminal
$ oc get pods -n amq-interconnect
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
amq-interconnect-645db76c76-k8ghs       1/1     Running   0          23h
interconnect-operator-5cb5fc7cc-4v7qm   1/1     Running   0          23h
```

2. Check that the required linuxptp-daemon PTP event producer pods are running in the openshift-ptp namespace.

```terminal
$ oc get pods -n openshift-ptp
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS       AGE
linuxptp-daemon-2t78p    3/3     Running   0              12h
linuxptp-daemon-k8n88    3/3     Running   0              12h
```


# Subscribing DU applications to PTP events with the REST API

Subscribe applications to PTP events by using the resource address /cluster/node/<node_name>/ptp, where <node_name> is the cluster node running the DU application.

Deploy your cloud-event-consumer DU application container and cloud-event-proxy sidecar container in a separate DU application pod. The cloud-event-consumer DU application subscribes to the cloud-event-proxy container in the application pod.

Use the following API endpoints to subscribe the cloud-event-consumer DU application to PTP events posted by the cloud-event-proxy container at http://localhost:8089/api/ocloudNotifications/v1/ in the DU application pod:

* /api/ocloudNotifications/v1/subscriptions
* POST: Creates a new subscription
* GET: Retrieves a list of subscriptions
* DELETE: Deletes all subscriptions
* /api/ocloudNotifications/v1/subscriptions/{subscription_id}
* GET: Returns details for the specified subscription ID
* DELETE: Deletes the subscription associated with the specified subscription ID
* /api/ocloudNotifications/v1/health
* GET: Returns the health status of ocloudNotifications API
* api/ocloudNotifications/v1/publishers
* GET: Returns an array of os-clock-sync-state, ptp-clock-class-change, lock-state, and gnss-sync-status messages for the cluster node
* /api/ocloudnotifications/v1/{resource_address}/CurrentState
* GET: Returns the current state of one the following event types: os-clock-sync-state, ptp-clock-class-change, lock-state, or gnss-state-change events


[NOTE]
----
9089 is the default port for the cloud-event-consumer container deployed in the application pod. You can configure a different port for your DU application as required.

# Monitoring PTP fast event metrics

You can monitor PTP fast events metrics from cluster nodes where the linuxptp-daemon is running.
You can also monitor PTP fast event metrics in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console by using the preconfigured and self-updating Prometheus monitoring stack.

* Install the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI oc.
* Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* Install and configure the PTP Operator on a node with PTP-capable hardware.

1. Start a debug pod for the node by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc debug node/<node_name>
```

2. Check for PTP metrics exposed by the linuxptp-daemon container. For example, run the following command:

```terminal
sh-4.4# curl http://localhost:9091/metrics
```

Example output

```
# HELP cne_api_events_published Metric to get number of events published by the rest api
# TYPE cne_api_events_published gauge
cne_api_events_published{address="/cluster/node/compute-1.example.com/sync/gnss-status/gnss-sync-status",status="success"} 1
cne_api_events_published{address="/cluster/node/compute-1.example.com/sync/ptp-status/lock-state",status="success"} 94
cne_api_events_published{address="/cluster/node/compute-1.example.com/sync/ptp-status/ptp-clock-class-change",status="success"} 18
cne_api_events_published{address="/cluster/node/compute-1.example.com/sync/sync-status/os-clock-sync-state",status="success"} 27
```

3. To view the PTP event in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, copy the name of the PTP metric you want to query, for example, openshift_ptp_offset_ns.
4. In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, click Observe -> Metrics.
5. Paste the PTP metric name into the Expression field, and click Run queries.

* Accessing metrics as an administrator

# PTP fast event metrics reference

The following table describes the PTP fast events metrics that are available from cluster nodes where the linuxptp-daemon service is running.



## PTP fast event metrics only when T-GM is enabled

The following table describes the PTP fast event metrics that are available only when PTP grandmaster clock (T-GM) is enabled.
