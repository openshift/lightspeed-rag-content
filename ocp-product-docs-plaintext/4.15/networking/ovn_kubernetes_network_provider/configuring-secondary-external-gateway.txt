Configure an external gateway on the default network

As a cluster administrator, you can configure an external gateway on the default network.

This feature offers the following benefits:

Granular control over egress traffic on a per-namespace basis

Flexible configuration of static and dynamic external gateway IP addresses

Support for both IPv4 and IPv6 address families
Prerequisites
Your cluster uses the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin.

Your infrastructure is configured to route traffic from the secondary external gateway.
How Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform determines the external gateway IP address
You configure a secondary external gateway with the AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute custom resource (CR) from the k8s.ovn.org API group. The CR supports static and dynamic approaches to specifying an external gateway's IP address.

Each namespace that a AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute CR targets cannot be selected by any other AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute CR. A namespace cannot have concurrent secondary external gateways.

Changes to policies are isolated in the controller. If a policy fails to apply, changes to other policies do not trigger a retry of other policies. Policies are only re-evaluated, applying any differences that might have occurred by the change, when updates to the policy itself or related objects to the policy such as target namespaces, pod gateways, or namespaces hosting them from dynamic hops are made.


Static assignment
You specify an IP address directly.
Dynamic assignment
You specify an IP address indirectly, with namespace and pod selectors, and an optional network attachment definition.
AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute object configuration
You can define an AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute object, which is cluster scoped, with the following properties. A namespace can be selected by only one AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute CR at a time.





Example secondary external gateway configurations
In the following example, the AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute object configures two static IP addresses as external gateways for pods in namespaces with the kubernetes.io/metadata.name: novxlan-externalgw-ecmp-4059 label.

apiVersion: k8s.ovn.org/v1
kind: AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute
metadata:
  name: default-route-policy
spec:
  from:
    namespaceSelector:
      matchLabels:
        kubernetes.io/metadata.name: novxlan-externalgw-ecmp-4059
  nextHops:
    static:
    - ip: "172.18.0.8"
    - ip: "172.18.0.9"
In the following example, the AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute object configures a dynamic external gateway. The IP addresses used for the external gateway are derived from the additional network attachments associated with each of the selected pods.

apiVersion: k8s.ovn.org/v1
kind: AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute
metadata:
  name: shadow-traffic-policy
spec:
  from:
    namespaceSelector:
      matchLabels:
        externalTraffic: ""
  nextHops:
    dynamic:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          gatewayPod: ""
      namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          shadowTraffic: ""
      networkAttachmentName: shadow-gateway
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          gigabyteGW: ""
      namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          gatewayNamespace: ""
      networkAttachmentName: gateway
In the following example, the AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute object configures both static and dynamic external gateways.

apiVersion: k8s.ovn.org/v1
kind: AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute
metadata:
  name: multi-hop-policy
spec:
  from:
    namespaceSelector:
      matchLabels:
        trafficType: "egress"
  nextHops:
    static:
    - ip: "172.18.0.8"
    - ip: "172.18.0.9"
    dynamic:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          gatewayPod: ""
      namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          egressTraffic: ""
      networkAttachmentName: gigabyte
Configure a secondary external gateway
You can configure an external gateway on the default network for a namespace in your cluster.

You installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You are logged in to the cluster with a user with cluster-admin privileges.


Create a YAML file that contains an AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute object.

To create an admin policy based external route, enter the following command:
