Rolling back to the OpenShift SDN network provider

As a cluster administrator, you can rollback to the OpenShift SDN network plugin from the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin if the migration to OVN-Kubernetes is unsuccessful.

OpenShift SDN CNI is deprecated as of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14. As of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15, the network plugin is not an option for new installations. In a subsequent future release, the OpenShift SDN network plugin is planned to be removed and no longer supported. RedÂ Hat will provide bug fixes and support for this feature until it is removed, but this feature will no longer receive enhancements. As an alternative to OpenShift SDN CNI, you can use OVN Kubernetes CNI instead.
Migrating to the OpenShift SDN network plugin
As a cluster administrator, you can migrate to the OpenShift SDN Container Network Interface (CNI) network plugin. During the migration you must reboot every node in your cluster.

Rollback to OpenShift SDN if the migration to OVN-Kubernetes fails.
Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

Access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

A cluster installed on infrastructure configured with the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin.

A recent backup of the etcd database is available.

A reboot can be triggered manually for each node.

The cluster is in a known good state, without any errors.


Stop all of the machine configuration pools managed by the Machine Config Operator (MCO):

To prepare for the migration, set the migration field to null by entering the following command:

To start the migration, set the network plugin back to OpenShift SDN by entering the following commands:

Optional: You can disable automatic migration of several OVN-Kubernetes capabilities to the OpenShift SDN equivalents:

Optional: You can customize the following settings for OpenShift SDN to meet your network infrastructure requirements:

Reboot each node in your cluster. You can reboot the nodes in your cluster with either of the following approaches:

Wait until the Multus daemon set rollout completes. Run the following command to see your rollout status:

After the nodes in your cluster have rebooted and the multus pods are rolled out, start all of the machine configuration pools by running the following commands::

Confirm the status of the new machine configuration on the hosts:

Confirm that the migration succeeded:

Complete the following steps only if the migration succeeds and your cluster is in a good state:
