Enabling multicast for a project

About multicast
With IP multicast, data is broadcast to many IP addresses simultaneously.

At this time, multicast is best used for low-bandwidth coordination or service discovery and not a high-bandwidth solution.

By default, network policies affect all connections in a namespace. However, multicast is unaffected by network policies. If multicast is enabled in the same namespace as your network policies, it is always allowed, even if there is a deny-all network policy. Cluster administrators should consider the implications to the exemption of multicast from network policies before enabling it.
Multicast traffic between "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" pods is disabled by default. If you are using the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, you can enable multicast on a per-project basis.
Enabling multicast between pods
You can enable multicast between pods for your project.

Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You must log in to the cluster with a user that has the cluster-admin
role.


Run the following command to enable multicast for a project. Replace <namespace> with the namespace for the project you want to enable multicast for.


To verify that multicast is enabled for a project, complete the following procedure:

Change your current project to the project that you enabled multicast for. Replace <project> with the project name.

Create a pod to act as a multicast receiver:

Create a pod to act as a multicast sender:

In a new terminal window or tab, start the multicast listener.

Start the multicast transmitter.
