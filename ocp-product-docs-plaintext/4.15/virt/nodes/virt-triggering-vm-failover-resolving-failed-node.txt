Deleting a failed node to trigger virtual machine failover

If a node fails and machine health checks are not deployed on your cluster, virtual machines (VMs) with runStrategy: Always configured are not automatically relocated to healthy nodes. To trigger VM failover, you must manually delete the Node object.

If you installed your cluster by using installer-provisioned infrastructure and you properly configured machine health checks, the following events occur:

Failed nodes are automatically recycled.

Virtual machines with runStrategy set to Always or RerunOnFailure are automatically scheduled on healthy nodes.
Prerequisites
A node where a virtual machine was running has the NotReady condition.

The virtual machine that was running on the failed node has runStrategy set to Always.

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
Deleting nodes from a bare metal cluster
When you delete a node using the CLI, the node object is deleted in Kubernetes, but the pods that exist on the node are not deleted. Any bare pods not backed by a replication controller become inaccessible to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. Pods backed by replication controllers are rescheduled to other available nodes. You must delete local manifest pods.

Delete a node from an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster running on bare metal by completing the following steps:

Mark the node as unschedulable:

Drain all pods on the node:

Delete the node from the cluster:

If you powered down the physical hardware, turn it back on so that the node can rejoin the cluster.
Verifying virtual machine failover
After all resources are terminated on the unhealthy node, a new virtual machine instance (VMI) is automatically created on a healthy node for each relocated VM. To confirm that the VMI was created, view all VMIs by using the oc CLI.

Listing all virtual machine instances using the CLI
You can list all virtual machine instances (VMIs) in your cluster, including standalone VMIs and those owned by virtual machines, by using the oc command-line interface (CLI).

List all VMIs by running the following command:
