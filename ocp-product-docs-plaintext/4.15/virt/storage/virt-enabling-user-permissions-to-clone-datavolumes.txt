# Enabling user permissions to clone data volumes across namespaces


The isolating nature of namespaces means that users cannot by default
clone resources between namespaces.
To enable a user to clone a virtual machine to another namespace, a
user with the cluster-admin role must create a new cluster role. Bind
this cluster role to a user to enable them to clone virtual machines
to the destination namespace.

# Creating RBAC resources for cloning data volumes

Create a new cluster role that enables permissions for all actions for the datavolumes resource.

* You must have cluster admin privileges.


[NOTE]
----
If you are a non-admin user that is an administrator for both the source and target namespaces, you can create a Role instead of a ClusterRole where appropriate.
----

1. Create a ClusterRole manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: <datavolume-cloner> 1
rules:
- apiGroups: ["cdi.kubevirt.io"]
  resources: ["datavolumes/source"]
  verbs: ["*"]
```

Unique name for the cluster role.
2. Create the cluster role in the cluster:

```terminal
$ oc create -f <datavolume-cloner.yaml> 1
```

The file name of the ClusterRole manifest created in the previous step.
3. Create a RoleBinding manifest that applies to both the source and destination namespaces and references
the cluster role created in the previous step.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: <allow-clone-to-user> 1
  namespace: <Source namespace> 2
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: default
  namespace: <Destination namespace> 3
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: datavolume-cloner 4
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

Unique name for the role binding.
The namespace for the source data volume.
The namespace to which the data volume is cloned.
The name of the cluster role created in the previous step.
4. Create the role binding in the cluster:

```terminal
$ oc create -f <datavolume-cloner.yaml> 1
```

The file name of the RoleBinding manifest created in the previous step.
