Updating OpenShift Virtualization

Learn how Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) delivers z-stream and minor version updates for OpenShift Virtualization.
OpenShift Virtualization on RHEL 9
OpenShift Virtualization 4.14 is based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9. You can update to OpenShift Virtualization 4.14 from a version that was based on RHEL 8 by following the standard OpenShift Virtualization update procedure. No additional steps are required.

As in previous versions, you can perform the update without disrupting running workloads. OpenShift Virtualization 4.14 supports live migration from RHEL 8 nodes to RHEL 9 nodes.

RHEL 9 machine type
All VM templates that are included with OpenShift Virtualization now use the RHEL 9 machine type by default: machineType: pc-q35-rhel9.<y>.0, where <y> is a single digit corresponding to the latest minor version of RHEL 9. For example, the value pc-q35-rhel9.2.0 is used for RHEL 9.2.

Updating OpenShift Virtualization does not change the machineType value of any existing VMs. These VMs continue to function as they did before the update. You can optionally change a VM's machine type so that it can benefit from RHEL 9 improvements.

Before you change a VM's machineType value, you must shut down the VM.
About updating OpenShift Virtualization
Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) manages the lifecycle of the OpenShift Virtualization Operator. The Marketplace Operator, which is deployed during Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation, makes external Operators available to your cluster.

OLM provides z-stream and minor version updates for OpenShift Virtualization. Minor version updates become available when you update Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform to the next minor version. You cannot update OpenShift Virtualization to the next minor version without first updating Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

OpenShift Virtualization subscriptions use a single update channel that is named stable. The stable channel ensures that your OpenShift Virtualization and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform versions are compatible.

If your subscription's approval strategy is set to Automatic, the update process starts as soon as a new version of the Operator is available in the stable channel. It is highly recommended to use the Automatic approval strategy to maintain a supportable environment. Each minor version of OpenShift Virtualization is only supported if you run the corresponding Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version. For example, you must run OpenShift Virtualization 4.14 on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14.

The amount of time an update takes to complete depends on your network
connection. Most automatic updates complete within fifteen minutes.

Updating OpenShift Virtualization does not interrupt network connections.

Data volumes and their associated persistent volume claims are preserved during update.


If you have virtual machines running that use hostpath provisioner storage, they cannot be live migrated and might block an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster update.

As a workaround, you can reconfigure the virtual machines so that they can be powered off automatically during a cluster update. Remove the evictionStrategy: LiveMigrate field and set the runStrategy field to Always.
About workload updates
When you update OpenShift Virtualization, virtual machine workloads, including libvirt, virt-launcher, and qemu, update automatically if they support live migration.

Each virtual machine has a virt-launcher pod that runs the virtual machine instance (VMI). The virt-launcher pod runs an instance of libvirt, which is used to manage the virtual machine (VM) process.
You can configure how workloads are updated by editing the spec.workloadUpdateStrategy stanza of the HyperConverged custom resource (CR). There are two available workload update methods: LiveMigrate and Evict.

Because the Evict method shuts down VMI pods, only the LiveMigrate update strategy is enabled by default.

When LiveMigrate is the only update strategy enabled:

VMIs that support live migration are migrated during the update process. The VM guest moves into a new pod with the updated components enabled.

VMIs that do not support live migration are not disrupted or updated.


If you enable both LiveMigrate and Evict:

VMIs that support live migration use the LiveMigrate update strategy.

VMIs that do not support live migration use the Evict update strategy. If a VMI is controlled by a VirtualMachine object that has runStrategy: Always set, a new VMI is created in a new pod with updated components.



When updating workloads, live migration fails if a pod is in the Pending state for the following periods:


5 minutes
If the pod is pending because it is Unschedulable.
15 minutes
If the pod is stuck in the pending state for any reason.


When a VMI fails to migrate, the virt-controller tries to migrate it again. It repeats this process until all migratable VMIs are running on new virt-launcher pods. If a VMI is improperly configured, however, these attempts can repeat indefinitely.

Each attempt corresponds to a migration object. Only the five most recent attempts are held in a buffer. This prevents migration objects from accumulating on the system while retaining information for debugging.
About EUS-to-EUS updates
Every even-numbered minor version of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, including 4.10 and 4.12, is an Extended Update Support (EUS) version. However, because Kubernetes design mandates serial minor version updates, you cannot directly update from one EUS version to the next.

After you update from the source EUS version to the next odd-numbered minor version, you must sequentially update OpenShift Virtualization to all z-stream releases of that minor version that are on your update path. When you have upgraded to the latest applicable z-stream version, you can then update Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform to the target EUS minor version.

When the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform update succeeds, the corresponding update for OpenShift Virtualization becomes available. You can now update OpenShift Virtualization to the target EUS version.

Preparing to update
Before beginning an EUS-to-EUS update, you must:

Pause worker nodes' machine config pools before you start an EUS-to-EUS update so that the workers are not rebooted twice.

Disable automatic workload updates before you begin the update process. This is to prevent OpenShift Virtualization from migrating or evicting your virtual machines (VMs) until you update to your target EUS version.


By default, OpenShift Virtualization automatically updates workloads, such as the virt-launcher pod, when you update the OpenShift Virtualization Operator. You can configure this behavior in the spec.workloadUpdateStrategy stanza of the HyperConverged custom resource.
Learn more about performing an EUS-to-EUS update.
Preventing workload updates during an EUS-to-EUS update
When you update from one Extended Update Support (EUS) version to the next, you must manually disable automatic workload updates to prevent OpenShift Virtualization from migrating or evicting workloads during the update process.

You are running an EUS version of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and want to update to the next EUS version. You have not yet updated to the odd-numbered version in between.

You read "Preparing to perform an EUS-to-EUS update" and learned the caveats and requirements that pertain to your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

You paused the worker nodes' machine config pools as directed by the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform documentation.

It is recommended that you use the default Automatic approval strategy. If you use the Manual approval strategy, you must approve all pending updates in the web console. For more details, refer to the "Manually approving a pending Operator update" section.


Back up the current workloadUpdateMethods configuration by running the following command:

Turn off all workload update methods by running the following command:

Ensure that the HyperConverged Operator is Upgradeable before you continue. Enter the following command and monitor the output:

Manually update your cluster from the source EUS version to the next minor version of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform:

Update OpenShift Virtualization.

Monitor the OpenShift Virtualization update by running the following command:

Update OpenShift Virtualization to every z-stream version that is available for the non-EUS minor version, monitoring each update by running the command shown in the previous step.

Confirm that OpenShift Virtualization successfully updated to the latest z-stream release of the non-EUS version by running the following command:

Wait until the HyperConverged Operator has the Upgradeable status before you perform the next update. Enter the following command and monitor the output:

Update Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform to the target EUS version.

Confirm that the update succeeded by checking the cluster version:

Update OpenShift Virtualization to the target EUS version.

Monitor the OpenShift Virtualization update by running the following command:

Restore the workload update methods configuration that you backed up:


You can now unpause the worker nodes' machine config pools.
Configuring workload update methods
You can configure workload update methods by editing the HyperConverged custom resource (CR).

To use live migration as an update method, you must first enable live migration in the cluster.


To open the HyperConverged CR in your default editor, run the following command:

Edit the workloadUpdateStrategy stanza of the HyperConverged CR. For example:

To apply your changes, save and exit the editor.
Approving pending Operator updates
Manually approving a pending Operator update
If an installed Operator has the approval strategy in its subscription set to Manual, when new updates are released in its current update channel, the update must be manually approved before installation can begin.

An Operator previously installed using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).


In the Administrator perspective of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, navigate to Operators -> Installed Operators.

Operators that have a pending update display a status with Upgrade available. Click the name of the Operator you want to update.

Click the Subscription tab. Any updates requiring approval are displayed next to Upgrade status. For example, it might display 1 requires approval.

Click 1 requires approval, then click Preview Install Plan.

Review the resources that are listed as available for update. When satisfied, click Approve.

Navigate back to the Operators -> Installed Operators page to monitor the progress of the update. When complete, the status changes to Succeeded and Up to date.
Monitoring update status
Monitoring OpenShift Virtualization upgrade status
To monitor the status of a OpenShift Virtualization Operator upgrade, watch the cluster service version (CSV) PHASE. You can also monitor the CSV conditions in the web console or by running the command provided here.

The PHASE and conditions values are approximations that are based on available information.
Log in to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).


Run the following command:

Review the output, checking the PHASE field. For example:

Optional: Monitor the aggregated status of all OpenShift Virtualization component
conditions by running the following command:
Viewing outdated OpenShift Virtualization workloads
You can view a list of outdated workloads by using the CLI.

If there are outdated virtualization pods in your cluster, the OutdatedVirtualMachineInstanceWorkloads alert fires.
To view a list of outdated virtual machine instances (VMIs), run the following command:


Configure workload updates to ensure that VMIs update automatically.
