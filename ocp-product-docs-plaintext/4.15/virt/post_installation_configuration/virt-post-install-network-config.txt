Postinstallation network configuration

By default, OpenShift Virtualization is installed with a single, internal pod network.

After you install OpenShift Virtualization, you can install networking Operators and configure additional networks.
Installing networking Operators
You must install the Kubernetes NMState Operator to configure a Linux bridge network for live migration or external access to virtual machines (VMs). For installation instructions, see Installing the Kubernetes NMState Operator by using the web console.

You can install the SR-IOV Operator to manage SR-IOV network devices and network attachments. For installation instructions, see Installing the SR-IOV Network Operator.

You can add the MetalLB Operator to manage the lifecycle for an instance of MetalLB on your cluster. For installation instructions, see Installing the MetalLB Operator from the OperatorHub using the web console.
Configuring a Linux bridge network
After you install the Kubernetes NMState Operator, you can configure a Linux bridge network for live migration or external access to virtual machines (VMs).

Creating a Linux bridge NNCP
You can create a NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy (NNCP) manifest for a Linux bridge network.

You have installed the Kubernetes NMState Operator.


Create the NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy manifest. This example includes sample values that you must replace with your own information.
Creating a Linux bridge NAD by using the web console
You can create a network attachment definition (NAD) to provide layer-2 networking to pods and virtual machines by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

A Linux bridge network attachment definition is the most efficient method for connecting a virtual machine to a VLAN.

Configuring IP address management (IPAM) in a network attachment definition for virtual machines is not supported.
In the web console, click Networking -> NetworkAttachmentDefinitions.

Click Create Network Attachment Definition.

Enter a unique Name and optional Description.

Select CNV Linux bridge from the Network Type list.

Enter the name of the bridge in the Bridge Name field.

Optional: If the resource has VLAN IDs configured, enter the ID numbers in the VLAN Tag Number field.

Optional: Select MAC Spoof Check to enable MAC spoof filtering. This feature provides security against a MAC spoofing attack by allowing only a single MAC address to exit the pod.

Click Create.


Attaching a virtual machine (VM) to a Linux bridge network
Configuring a network for live migration
After you have configured a Linux bridge network, you can configure a dedicated network for live migration. A dedicated network minimizes the effects of network saturation on tenant workloads during live migration.

Configuring a dedicated secondary network for live migration
To configure a dedicated secondary network for live migration, you must first create a bridge network attachment definition (NAD) by using the CLI. Then, you add the name of the NetworkAttachmentDefinition object to the HyperConverged custom resource (CR).

You installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You logged in to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

Each node has at least two Network Interface Cards (NICs).

The NICs for live migration are connected to the same VLAN.


Create a NetworkAttachmentDefinition manifest according to the following example:

Open the HyperConverged CR in your default editor by running the following command:

Add the name of the NetworkAttachmentDefinition object to the spec.liveMigrationConfig stanza of the HyperConverged CR:

Save your changes and exit the editor. The virt-handler pods restart and connect to the secondary network.


When the node that the virtual machine runs on is placed into maintenance mode, the VM automatically migrates to another node in the cluster. You can verify that the migration occurred over the secondary network and not the default pod network by checking the target IP address in the virtual machine instance (VMI) metadata.
Selecting a dedicated network by using the web console
You can select a dedicated network for live migration by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

You configured a Multus network for live migration.


Navigate to Virtualization > Overview in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

Click the Settings tab and then click Live migration.

Select the network from the Live migration network list.
Configuring an SR-IOV network
After you install the SR-IOV Operator, you can configure an SR-IOV network.

Configuring SR-IOV network devices
The SR-IOV Network Operator adds the SriovNetworkNodePolicy.sriovnetwork.openshift.io CustomResourceDefinition to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. You can configure an SR-IOV network device by creating a SriovNetworkNodePolicy custom resource (CR).

When applying the configuration specified in a SriovNetworkNodePolicy object, the SR-IOV Operator might drain the nodes, and in some cases, reboot nodes.

It might take several minutes for a configuration change to apply.
You installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

You have installed the SR-IOV Network Operator.

You have enough available nodes in your cluster to handle the evicted workload from drained nodes.

You have not selected any control plane nodes for SR-IOV network device configuration.


Create an SriovNetworkNodePolicy object, and then save the YAML in the <name>-sriov-node-network.yaml file. Replace <name> with the name for this configuration.

Optional: Label the SR-IOV capable cluster nodes with SriovNetworkNodePolicy.Spec.NodeSelector if they are not already labeled. For more information about labeling nodes, see "Understanding how to update labels on nodes".

Create the SriovNetworkNodePolicy object:

To verify that the SR-IOV network device is configured, enter the following command. Replace <node_name> with the name of a node with the SR-IOV network device that you just configured.


Attaching a virtual machine (VM) to an SR-IOV network
Enabling load balancer service creation by using the web console
You can enable the creation of load balancer services for a virtual machine (VM) by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

You have configured a load balancer for the cluster.

You are logged in as a user with the cluster-admin role.


Navigate to Virtualization -> Overview.

On the Settings tab, click Cluster.

Expand General settings and SSH configuration.

Set SSH over LoadBalancer service to on.
