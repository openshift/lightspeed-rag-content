Restoring virtual machines

You restore an OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Backup custom resource (CR) by creating a Restore CR.

You can add hooks to the Restore CR to run commands in init containers, before the application container starts, or in the application container itself.

An exec hook runs commands or scripts in a container of a restored pod.


Add a hook to the spec.hooks block of the Restore CR, as in the following example:
