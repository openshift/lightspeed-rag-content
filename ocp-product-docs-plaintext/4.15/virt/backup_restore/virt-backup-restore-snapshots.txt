Backup and restore by using VM snapshots

You can back up and restore virtual machines (VMs) by using snapshots. Snapshots are supported by the following storage providers:

Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation

Any other cloud storage provider with the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver that supports the Kubernetes Volume Snapshot API


Online snapshots have a default time deadline of five minutes (5m) that can be changed, if needed.

Online snapshots are supported for virtual machines that have hot plugged virtual disks. However, hot plugged disks that are not in the virtual machine specification are not included in the snapshot.
To create snapshots of an online (Running state) VM with the highest integrity, install the QEMU guest agent if it is not included with your operating system. The QEMU guest agent is included with the default Red Hat templates.

The QEMU guest agent takes a consistent snapshot by attempting to quiesce the VM file system as much as possible, depending on the system workload. This ensures that in-flight I/O is written to the disk before the snapshot is taken. If the guest agent is not present, quiescing is not possible and a best-effort snapshot is taken. The conditions under which the snapshot was taken are reflected in the snapshot indications that are displayed in the web console or CLI.
About snapshots
A snapshot represents the state and data of a virtual machine (VM) at a specific point in time. You can use a snapshot to restore an existing VM to a previous state (represented by the snapshot) for backup and disaster recovery or to rapidly roll back to a previous development version.

A VM snapshot is created from a VM that is powered off (Stopped state) or powered on (Running state).

When taking a snapshot of a running VM, the controller checks that the QEMU guest agent is installed and running. If so, it freezes the VM file system before taking the snapshot, and thaws the file system after the snapshot is taken.

The snapshot stores a copy of each Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume attached to the VM and a copy of the VM specification and metadata. Snapshots cannot be changed after creation.

You can perform the following snapshot actions:

Create a new snapshot

Create a copy of a virtual machine from a snapshot

List all snapshots attached to a specific VM

Restore a VM from a snapshot

Delete an existing VM snapshot


The VM snapshot feature introduces three new API objects defined as custom resource definitions (CRDs) for managing snapshots:

VirtualMachineSnapshot: Represents a user request to create a snapshot. It contains information about the current state of the VM.

VirtualMachineSnapshotContent: Represents a provisioned resource on the cluster (a snapshot). It is created by the VM snapshot controller and contains references to all resources required to restore the VM.

VirtualMachineRestore: Represents a user request to restore a VM from a snapshot.


The VM snapshot controller binds a VirtualMachineSnapshotContent object with the VirtualMachineSnapshot object for which it was created, with a one-to-one mapping.
Creating snapshots
You can create snapshots of virtual machines (VMs) by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console or the command line.

Creating a snapshot by using the web console
You can create a snapshot of a virtual machine (VM) by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

The VM snapshot includes disks that meet the following requirements:

Either a data volume or a persistent volume claim

Belong to a storage class that supports Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume snapshots


Navigate to Virtualization -> VirtualMachines in the web console.

Select a VM to open the VirtualMachine details page.

If the VM is running, click the options menu . and select Stop to power it down.

Click the Snapshots tab and then click Take Snapshot.

Enter the snapshot name.

Expand Disks included in this Snapshot to see the storage volumes to be included in the snapshot.

If your VM has disks that cannot be included in the snapshot and you wish to proceed, select I am aware of this warning and wish to proceed.

Click Save.
Creating a snapshot by using the command line
You can create a virtual machine (VM) snapshot for an offline or online VM by creating a VirtualMachineSnapshot object.

Ensure that the persistent volume claims (PVCs) are in a storage class that supports Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume snapshots.

Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

Optional: Power down the VM for which you want to create a snapshot.


Create a YAML file to define a VirtualMachineSnapshot object that specifies the name of the new VirtualMachineSnapshot and the name of the source VM as in the following example:

Create the VirtualMachineSnapshot object:

Optional: If you are taking an online snapshot, you can use the wait command and monitor the status of the snapshot:


Verify that the VirtualMachineSnapshot object is created and bound with VirtualMachineSnapshotContent and that the readyToUse flag is set to true:

Check the spec:volumeBackups property of the VirtualMachineSnapshotContent resource to verify that the expected PVCs are included in the snapshot.
Verifying online snapshots by using snapshot indications
Snapshot indications are contextual information about online virtual machine (VM) snapshot operations. Indications are not available for offline virtual machine (VM) snapshot operations. Indications are helpful in describing details about the online snapshot creation.

You must have attempted to create an online VM snapshot.


Display the output from the snapshot indications by performing one of the following actions:

Verify the status of your online VM snapshot by viewing the values of the status.indications parameter:
Restoring virtual machines from snapshots
You can restore virtual machines (VMs) from snapshots by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console or the command line.

Restoring a VM from a snapshot by using the web console
You can restore a virtual machine (VM) to a previous configuration represented by a snapshot in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

Navigate to Virtualization -> VirtualMachines in the web console.

Select a VM to open the VirtualMachine details page.

If the VM is running, click the options menu . and select Stop to power it down.

Click the Snapshots tab to view a list of snapshots associated with the VM.

Select a snapshot to open the Snapshot Details screen.

Click the options menu . and select Restore VirtualMachineSnapshot.

Click Restore.
Restoring a VM from a snapshot by using the command line
You can restore an existing virtual machine (VM) to a previous configuration by using the command line. You can only restore from an offline VM snapshot.

Power down the VM you want to restore.


Create a YAML file to define a VirtualMachineRestore object that specifies the name of the VM you want to restore and the name of the snapshot to be used as the source as in the following example:

Create the VirtualMachineRestore object:


Verify that the VM is restored to the previous state represented by the snapshot and that the complete flag is set to true:
Deleting snapshots
You can delete snapshots of virtual machines (VMs) by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console or the command line.

Deleting a snapshot by using the web console
You can delete an existing virtual machine (VM) snapshot by using the web console.

Navigate to Virtualization -> VirtualMachines in the web console.

Select a VM to open the VirtualMachine details page.

Click the Snapshots tab to view a list of snapshots associated with the VM.

Click the options menu . beside a snapshot and select Delete VirtualMachineSnapshot.

Click Delete.
Deleting a virtual machine snapshot in the CLI
You can delete an existing virtual machine (VM) snapshot by deleting the appropriate VirtualMachineSnapshot object.

Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).


Delete the VirtualMachineSnapshot object:


Verify that the snapshot is deleted and no longer attached to this VM:
