Collecting data for Red Hat Support

When you submit a support case to Red Hat Support, it is helpful to provide debugging information for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and OpenShift Virtualization by using the following tools:


must-gather tool
The must-gather tool collects diagnostic information, including resource definitions and service logs.
Prometheus
Prometheus is a time-series database and a rule evaluation engine for metrics. Prometheus sends alerts to Alertmanager for processing.
Alertmanager
The Alertmanager service handles alerts received from Prometheus. The Alertmanager is also responsible for sending the alerts to external notification systems.


For information about the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring stack, see About Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring.
Collecting data about your environment
Collecting data about your environment minimizes the time required to analyze and determine the root cause.

Set the retention time for Prometheus metrics data to a minimum of seven days.

Configure the Alertmanager to capture relevant alerts and to send alert notifications to a dedicated mailbox so that they can be viewed and persisted outside the cluster.

Record the exact number of affected nodes and virtual machines.


Collect must-gather data for the cluster.

Collect must-gather data for Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation, if necessary.

Collect must-gather data for OpenShift Virtualization.

Collect Prometheus metrics for the cluster.
Collecting data about virtual machines
Collecting data about malfunctioning virtual machines (VMs) minimizes the time required to analyze and determine the root cause.

Linux VMs: Install the latest QEMU guest agent.

Windows VMs:


Collect must-gather data for the VMs using the /usr/bin/gather script.

Collect screenshots of VMs that have crashed before you restart them.

Collect memory dumps from VMs before remediation attempts.

Record factors that the malfunctioning VMs have in common. For example, the VMs have the same host or network.
Using the must-gather tool for OpenShift Virtualization
You can collect data about OpenShift Virtualization resources by running the must-gather command with the OpenShift Virtualization image.

The default data collection includes information about the following resources:

OpenShift Virtualization Operator namespaces, including child objects

OpenShift Virtualization custom resource definitions

Namespaces that contain virtual machines

Basic virtual machine definitions


Instance types information is not currently collected by default; you can, however, run a command to optionally collect it.

Run the following command to collect data about OpenShift Virtualization:


must-gather tool options
You can specify a combination of scripts and environment variables for the following options:

Collecting detailed virtual machine (VM) information from a namespace

Collecting detailed information about specified VMs

Collecting image, image-stream, and image-stream-tags information

Limiting the maximum number of parallel processes used by the must-gather tool


Parameters
You can specify environment variables for a compatible script.


NS=<namespace_name>
Collect virtual machine information, including virt-launcher pod details, from the namespace that you specify. The VirtualMachine and VirtualMachineInstance CR data is collected for all namespaces.
VM=<vm_name>
Collect details about a particular virtual machine. To use this option, you must also specify a namespace by using the NS environment variable.
PROS=<number_of_processes>
Modify the maximum number of parallel processes that the must-gather tool uses. The default value is 5.


Each script is compatible only with certain environment variable combinations.


/usr/bin/gather
Use the default must-gather script, which collects cluster data from all namespaces and includes only basic VM information. This script is compatible only with the PROS variable.
/usr/bin/gather --vms_details
Collect VM log files, VM definitions, control-plane logs, and namespaces that belong to OpenShift Virtualization resources. Specifying namespaces includes their child objects. If you use this parameter without specifying a namespace or VM, the must-gather tool collects this data for all VMs in the cluster. This script is compatible with all environment variables, but you must specify a namespace if you use the VM variable.
/usr/bin/gather --images
Collect image, image-stream, and image-stream-tags custom resource information. This script is compatible only with the PROS variable.
/usr/bin/gather --instancetypes
Collect instance types information. This information is not currently collected by default; you can, however, optionally collect it.
Usage and examples
Environment variables are optional. You can run a script by itself or with one or more compatible environment variables.


$ oc adm must-gather \
  --image=registry.redhat.io/container-native-virtualization/cnv-must-gather-rhel9:v4.14.0 \
  -- <environment_variable_1> <environment_variable_2> <script_name>
By default, five processes run in parallel.

$ oc adm must-gather \
  --image=registry.redhat.io/container-native-virtualization/cnv-must-gather-rhel9:v4.14.0 \
  -- PROS=5 /usr/bin/gather 1
You can modify the number of parallel processes by changing the default.


The following command collects detailed VM information for the my-vm VM in the mynamespace namespace:

$ oc adm must-gather \
  --image=registry.redhat.io/container-native-virtualization/cnv-must-gather-rhel9:v4.14.0 \
  -- NS=mynamespace VM=my-vm /usr/bin/gather --vms_details 1
The NS environment variable is mandatory if you use the VM environment variable.


The following command collects image, image-stream, and image-stream-tags information from the cluster:

$ oc adm must-gather \
  --image=registry.redhat.io/container-native-virtualization/cnv-must-gather-rhel9:v4.14.0 \
  /usr/bin/gather --images
The following command collects instance types information from the cluster:

$ oc adm must-gather \
  --image=registry.redhat.io/container-native-virtualization/cnv-must-gather-rhel9:v4.14.0 \
  /usr/bin/gather --instancetypes
