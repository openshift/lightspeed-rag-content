Installing OpenShift Virtualization

Install OpenShift Virtualization to add virtualization functionality to your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

If you install OpenShift Virtualization in a restricted environment with no internet connectivity, you must configure Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) for restricted networks.

If you have limited internet connectivity, you can configure proxy support in OLM to access the OperatorHub.
Installing the OpenShift Virtualization Operator
Install the OpenShift Virtualization Operator by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console or the command line.

Installing the OpenShift Virtualization Operator by using the web console
You can deploy the OpenShift Virtualization Operator by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

Install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15 on your cluster.

Log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console as a user with cluster-admin permissions.


From the Administrator perspective, click Operators -> OperatorHub.

In the Filter by keyword field, type Virtualization.

Select the OpenShift Virtualization Operator tile with the Red Hat source label.

Read the information about the Operator and click Install.

On the Install Operator page:

Click Install to make the Operator available to the openshift-cnv namespace.

When the Operator installs successfully, click Create HyperConverged.

Optional: Configure Infra and Workloads node placement options for OpenShift Virtualization components.

Click Create to launch OpenShift Virtualization.


Navigate to the Workloads -> Pods page and monitor the OpenShift Virtualization pods until they are all Running. After all the pods display the Running state, you can use OpenShift Virtualization.
Installing the OpenShift Virtualization Operator by using the command line
Subscribe to the OpenShift Virtualization catalog and install the OpenShift Virtualization Operator by applying manifests to your cluster.

Subscribing to the OpenShift Virtualization catalog by using the CLI
Before you install OpenShift Virtualization, you must subscribe to the OpenShift Virtualization catalog. Subscribing gives the openshift-cnv namespace access to the OpenShift Virtualization Operators.

To subscribe, configure Namespace, OperatorGroup, and Subscription objects by applying a single manifest to your cluster.

Install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15 on your cluster.

Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.


Create the required Namespace, OperatorGroup, and Subscription objects
for OpenShift Virtualization by running the following command:


You can configure certificate rotation parameters in the YAML file.
Deploying the OpenShift Virtualization Operator by using the CLI
You can deploy the OpenShift Virtualization Operator by using the oc CLI.

Subscribe to the OpenShift Virtualization catalog in the openshift-cnv namespace.

Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.


Create a YAML file that contains the following manifest:

Deploy the OpenShift Virtualization Operator by running the following command:


Ensure that OpenShift Virtualization deployed successfully by watching the PHASE of the cluster service version (CSV) in the openshift-cnv namespace. Run the following command:
