About OpenShift Virtualization

Learn about OpenShift Virtualization's capabilities and support scope.
What you can do with OpenShift Virtualization
OpenShift Virtualization is an add-on to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform that allows you to run and manage virtual machine workloads alongside container workloads.

OpenShift Virtualization adds new objects into your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster by using Kubernetes custom resources to enable virtualization tasks. These tasks include:

Creating and managing Linux and Windows virtual machines (VMs)

Running pod and VM workloads alongside each other in a cluster

Connecting to virtual machines through a variety of consoles and CLI tools

Importing and cloning existing virtual machines

Managing network interface controllers and storage disks attached to virtual machines

Live migrating virtual machines between nodes


An enhanced web console provides a graphical portal to manage these virtualized resources alongside the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster containers and infrastructure.

OpenShift Virtualization is designed and tested to work well with Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation features.

When you deploy OpenShift Virtualization with OpenShift Data Foundation, you must create a dedicated storage class for Windows virtual machine disks. See Optimizing ODF PersistentVolumes for Windows VMs for details.
You can use OpenShift Virtualization with OVN-Kubernetes, OpenShift SDN, or one of the other certified network plugins listed in Certified OpenShift CNI Plug-ins.

You can check your OpenShift Virtualization cluster for compliance issues by installing the Compliance Operator and running a scan with the ocp4-moderate and ocp4-moderate-node profiles. The Compliance Operator uses OpenSCAP, a NIST-certified tool, to scan and enforce security policies.

OpenShift Virtualization supported cluster version
OpenShift Virtualization 4.14 is supported for use on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15 clusters. To use the latest z-stream release of OpenShift Virtualization, you must first upgrade to the latest version of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
About volume and access modes for virtual machine disks
If you use the storage API with known storage providers, the volume and access modes are selected automatically. However, if you use a storage class that does not have a storage profile, you must configure the volume and access mode.

For best results, use the ReadWriteMany (RWX) access mode and the Block volume mode. This is important for the following reasons:

ReadWriteMany (RWX) access mode is required for live migration.

The Block volume mode performs significantly better than the Filesystem volume mode. This is because the Filesystem volume mode uses more storage layers, including a file system layer and a disk image file. These layers are not necessary for VM disk storage.


You cannot live migrate virtual machines with the following configurations:

Storage volume with ReadWriteOnce (RWO) access mode

Passthrough features such as GPUs


Do not set the evictionStrategy field to LiveMigrate for these virtual machines.
Single-node OpenShift differences
You can install OpenShift Virtualization on single-node OpenShift.

However, you should be aware that Single-node OpenShift does not support the following features:

High availability

Pod disruption

Live migration

Virtual machines or templates that have an eviction strategy configured
