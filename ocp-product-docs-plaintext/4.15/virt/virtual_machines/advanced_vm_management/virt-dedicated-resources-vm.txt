Enabling dedicated resources for virtual machines

To improve performance, you can dedicate node resources, such as CPU, to a virtual machine.
About dedicated resources
When you enable dedicated resources for your virtual machine, your virtual machine's workload is scheduled on CPUs that will not be used by other processes. By using dedicated resources, you can improve the performance of the virtual machine and the accuracy of latency predictions.
Prerequisites
The CPU Manager  must be configured on the node. Verify that the node has the cpumanager = true label before scheduling virtual machine workloads.

The virtual machine must be powered off.
Enabling dedicated resources for a virtual machine
You enable dedicated resources for a virtual machine in the Details tab. Virtual machines that were created from a Red Hat template can be configured with dedicated resources.

In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform console, click Virtualization -> VirtualMachines from the side menu.

Select a virtual machine to open the VirtualMachine details page.

On the Configuration -> Scheduling tab, click the edit icon beside Dedicated Resources.

Select Schedule this workload with dedicated resources (guaranteed policy).

Click Save.
