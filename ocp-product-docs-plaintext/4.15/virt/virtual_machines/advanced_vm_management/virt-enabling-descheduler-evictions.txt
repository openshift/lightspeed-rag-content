Enabling descheduler evictions on virtual machines

You can use the descheduler to evict pods so that the pods can be rescheduled onto more appropriate nodes. If the pod is a virtual machine, the pod eviction causes the virtual machine to be live migrated to another node.

Descheduler eviction for virtual machines is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
Descheduler profiles
Use the Technology Preview DevPreviewLongLifecycle profile to enable the descheduler on a virtual machine. This is the only descheduler profile currently available for OpenShift Virtualization. To ensure proper scheduling, create VMs with CPU and memory requests for the expected load.


DevPreviewLongLifecycle
This profile balances resource usage between nodes and enables the following strategies:
Installing the descheduler
The descheduler is not available by default. To enable the descheduler, you must install the Kube Descheduler Operator from OperatorHub and enable one or more descheduler profiles.

By default, the descheduler runs in predictive mode, which means that it only simulates pod evictions. You must change the mode to automatic for the descheduler to perform the pod evictions.

If you have enabled hosted control planes in your cluster, set a custom priority threshold to lower the chance that pods in the hosted control plane namespaces are evicted. Set the priority threshold class name to hypershift-control-plane, because it has the lowest priority value (100000000) of the hosted control plane priority classes.
You are logged in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform as a user with the cluster-admin role.

Access to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.


Log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

Create the required namespace for the Kube Descheduler Operator.

Install the Kube Descheduler Operator.

Create a descheduler instance.


You can also configure the profiles and settings for the descheduler later using the OpenShift CLI (oc).
Enabling descheduler evictions on a virtual machine (VM)
After the descheduler is installed, you can enable descheduler evictions on your VM by adding an annotation to the VirtualMachine custom resource (CR).

Install the descheduler in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console or OpenShift CLI (oc).

Ensure that the VM is not running.


Before starting the VM, add the descheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/evict annotation to the VirtualMachine CR:

If you did not already set the DevPreviewLongLifecycle profile in the web console during installation, specify the DevPreviewLongLifecycle in the spec.profile section of the KubeDescheduler object:


The descheduler is now enabled on the VM.
