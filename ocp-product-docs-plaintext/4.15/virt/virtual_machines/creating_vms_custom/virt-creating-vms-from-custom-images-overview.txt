Creating virtual machines from custom images overview

You can create virtual machines (VMs) from custom operating system images by using one of the following methods:

Importing the image as a container disk from a registry.

Importing the image from a web page.

Uploading the image from a local machine.

Cloning a persistent volume claim (PVC) that contains the image.


The Containerized Data Importer (CDI) imports the image into a PVC by using a data volume. You add the PVC to the VM by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console or command line.

You must install the QEMU guest agent on VMs created from operating system images that are not provided by Red Hat.

You must also install VirtIO drivers on Windows VMs.

The QEMU guest agent is included with Red Hat images.
