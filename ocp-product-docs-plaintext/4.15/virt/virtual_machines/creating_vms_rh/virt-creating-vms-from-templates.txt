Customization
You can customize the disk source and VM parameters before you start the VM:


If you copy a VM template with all its labels and annotations, your version of the template is marked as deprecated when a new version of the Scheduling, Scale, and Performance (SSP) Operator is deployed. You can remove this designation. See Customizing a VM template by using the web console.
