Connecting a virtual machine to an SR-IOV network

You can connect a virtual machine (VM) to a Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) network by performing the following steps:

Configuring an SR-IOV network device

Configuring an SR-IOV network

Connecting the VM to the SR-IOV network
Configuring SR-IOV network devices
The SR-IOV Network Operator adds the SriovNetworkNodePolicy.sriovnetwork.openshift.io CustomResourceDefinition to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. You can configure an SR-IOV network device by creating a SriovNetworkNodePolicy custom resource (CR).

When applying the configuration specified in a SriovNetworkNodePolicy object, the SR-IOV Operator might drain the nodes, and in some cases, reboot nodes.

It might take several minutes for a configuration change to apply.
You installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

You have installed the SR-IOV Network Operator.

You have enough available nodes in your cluster to handle the evicted workload from drained nodes.

You have not selected any control plane nodes for SR-IOV network device configuration.


Create an SriovNetworkNodePolicy object, and then save the YAML in the <name>-sriov-node-network.yaml file. Replace <name> with the name for this configuration.

Optional: Label the SR-IOV capable cluster nodes with SriovNetworkNodePolicy.Spec.NodeSelector if they are not already labeled. For more information about labeling nodes, see "Understanding how to update labels on nodes".

Create the SriovNetworkNodePolicy object:

To verify that the SR-IOV network device is configured, enter the following command. Replace <node_name> with the name of a node with the SR-IOV network device that you just configured.
Configuring SR-IOV additional network
You can configure an additional network that uses SR-IOV hardware by creating an SriovNetwork object.

When you create an SriovNetwork object, the SR-IOV Network Operator automatically creates a NetworkAttachmentDefinition object.

Do not modify or delete an SriovNetwork object if it is attached to pods or virtual machines in a running state.
Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.


Create the following SriovNetwork object, and then save the YAML in the <name>-sriov-network.yaml file. Replace <name> with a name for this additional network.


apiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1
kind: SriovNetwork
metadata:
  name: <name> 1
  namespace: openshift-sriov-network-operator 2
spec:
  resourceName: <sriov_resource_name> 3
  networkNamespace: <target_namespace> 4
  vlan: <vlan> 5
  spoofChk: "<spoof_check>" 6
  linkState: <link_state> 7
  maxTxRate: <max_tx_rate> 8
  minTxRate: <min_rx_rate> 9
  vlanQoS: <vlan_qos> 10
  trust: "<trust_vf>" 11
  capabilities: <capabilities> 12
Replace <name> with a name for the object. The SR-IOV Network Operator creates a NetworkAttachmentDefinition object with same name.

Specify the namespace where the SR-IOV Network Operator is installed.

Replace <sriov_resource_name> with the value for the .spec.resourceName parameter from the SriovNetworkNodePolicy object that defines the SR-IOV hardware for this additional network.

Replace <target_namespace> with the target namespace for the SriovNetwork. Only pods or virtual machines in the target namespace can attach to the SriovNetwork.

Optional: Replace <vlan> with a Virtual LAN (VLAN) ID for the additional network. The integer value must be from 0 to 4095. The default value is 0.

Optional: Replace <spoof_check> with the spoof check mode of the VF. The allowed values are the strings "on" and "off".

Optional: Replace <link_state> with the link state of virtual function (VF). Allowed value are enable, disable and auto.

Optional: Replace <max_tx_rate> with a maximum transmission rate, in Mbps, for the VF.

Optional: Replace <min_tx_rate> with a minimum transmission rate, in Mbps, for the VF. This value should always be less than or equal to Maximum transmission rate.

Optional: Replace <vlan_qos> with an IEEE 802.1p priority level for the VF. The default value is 0.

Optional: Replace <trust_vf> with the trust mode of the VF. The allowed values are the strings "on" and "off".

Optional: Replace <capabilities> with the capabilities to configure for this network.


To create the object, enter the following command. Replace <name> with a name for this additional network.

Optional: To confirm that the NetworkAttachmentDefinition object associated with the SriovNetwork object that you created in the previous step exists, enter the following command. Replace <namespace> with the namespace you specified in the SriovNetwork object.
Connecting a virtual machine to an SR-IOV network by using the command line
You can connect the virtual machine (VM) to the SR-IOV network by including the network details in the VM configuration.

Add the SR-IOV network details to the spec.domain.devices.interfaces and spec.networks stanzas of the VM configuration as in the following example:

Apply the virtual machine configuration:
Connecting a VM to an SR-IOV network by using the web console
You can connect a VM to the SR-IOV network by including the network details in the VM configuration.

You must create a network attachment definition for the network.


Navigate to Virtualization -> VirtualMachines.

Click a VM to view the VirtualMachine details page.

On the Configuration tab, click the Network interfaces tab.

Click Add network interface.

Enter the interface name.

Select an SR-IOV network attachment definition from the Network list.

Select SR-IOV from the Type list.

Optional: Add a network Model or Mac address.

Click Save.

Restart or live-migrate the VM to apply the changes.
