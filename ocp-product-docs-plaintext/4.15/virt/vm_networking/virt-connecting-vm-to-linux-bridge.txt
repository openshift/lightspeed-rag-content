Connecting a virtual machine to a Linux bridge network

By default, OpenShift Virtualization is installed with a single, internal pod network.

You can create a Linux bridge network and attach a virtual machine (VM) to the network by performing the following steps:

Create a Linux bridge node network configuration policy (NNCP).

Create a Linux bridge network attachment definition (NAD) by using the web console or the command line.

Configure the VM to recognize the NAD by using the web console or the command line.
Creating a Linux bridge NNCP
You can create a NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy (NNCP) manifest for a Linux bridge network.

You have installed the Kubernetes NMState Operator.


Create the NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy manifest. This example includes sample values that you must replace with your own information.
Creating a Linux bridge NAD
You can create a Linux bridge network attachment definition (NAD) by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console or command line.

Creating a Linux bridge NAD by using the web console
You can create a network attachment definition (NAD) to provide layer-2 networking to pods and virtual machines by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

A Linux bridge network attachment definition is the most efficient method for connecting a virtual machine to a VLAN.

Configuring IP address management (IPAM) in a network attachment definition for virtual machines is not supported.
In the web console, click Networking -> NetworkAttachmentDefinitions.

Click Create Network Attachment Definition.

Enter a unique Name and optional Description.

Select CNV Linux bridge from the Network Type list.

Enter the name of the bridge in the Bridge Name field.

Optional: If the resource has VLAN IDs configured, enter the ID numbers in the VLAN Tag Number field.

Optional: Select MAC Spoof Check to enable MAC spoof filtering. This feature provides security against a MAC spoofing attack by allowing only a single MAC address to exit the pod.

Click Create.
Creating a Linux bridge NAD by using the command line
You can create a network attachment definition (NAD) to provide layer-2 networking to pods and virtual machines (VMs) by using the command line.

The NAD and the VM must be in the same namespace.

Configuring IP address management (IPAM) in a network attachment definition for virtual machines is not supported.
The node must support nftables and the nft binary must be deployed to enable MAC spoof check.


Add the VM to the NetworkAttachmentDefinition configuration, as in the following example:

Create the network attachment definition:


Verify that the network attachment definition was created by running the following command:
Configuring a VM network interface
You can configure a virtual machine (VM) network interface by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console or command line.

Configuring a VM network interface by using the web console
You can configure a network interface for a virtual machine (VM) by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

You created a network attachment definition for the network.


Navigate to Virtualization -> VirtualMachines.

Click a VM to view the VirtualMachine details page.

On the Configuration tab, click the Network interfaces tab.

Click Add network interface.

Enter the interface name and select the network attachment definition from the Network list.

Click Save.

Restart the VM to apply the changes.
Configuring a VM network interface by using the command line
You can configure a virtual machine (VM) network interface for a bridge network by using the command line.

Shut down the virtual machine before editing the configuration. If you edit a running virtual machine, you must restart the virtual machine for the changes to take effect.


Add the bridge interface and the network attachment definition to the VM configuration as in the following example:

Apply the configuration:

Optional: If you edited a running virtual machine, you must restart it for the changes to take effect.
