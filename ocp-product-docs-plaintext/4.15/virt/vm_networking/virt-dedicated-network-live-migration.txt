Configuring a dedicated network for live migration

You can configure a dedicated Multus network for live migration. A dedicated network minimizes the effects of network saturation on tenant workloads during live migration.
Configuring a dedicated secondary network for live migration
To configure a dedicated secondary network for live migration, you must first create a bridge network attachment definition (NAD) by using the CLI. Then, you add the name of the NetworkAttachmentDefinition object to the HyperConverged custom resource (CR).

You installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You logged in to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

Each node has at least two Network Interface Cards (NICs).

The NICs for live migration are connected to the same VLAN.


Create a NetworkAttachmentDefinition manifest according to the following example:

Open the HyperConverged CR in your default editor by running the following command:

Add the name of the NetworkAttachmentDefinition object to the spec.liveMigrationConfig stanza of the HyperConverged CR:

Save your changes and exit the editor. The virt-handler pods restart and connect to the secondary network.


When the node that the virtual machine runs on is placed into maintenance mode, the VM automatically migrates to another node in the cluster. You can verify that the migration occurred over the secondary network and not the default pod network by checking the target IP address in the virtual machine instance (VMI) metadata.
Selecting a dedicated network by using the web console
You can select a dedicated network for live migration by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

You configured a Multus network for live migration.


Navigate to Virtualization > Overview in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

Click the Settings tab and then click Live migration.

Select the network from the Live migration network list.
