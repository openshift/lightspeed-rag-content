Connecting a virtual machine to an OVN-Kubernetes secondary network

You can connect a virtual machine (VM) to an Open Virtual Network (OVN)-Kubernetes secondary network. OpenShift Virtualization supports the layer 2 and localnet topologies for OVN-Kubernetes.

A layer 2 topology connects workloads by a cluster-wide logical switch. The OVN-Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) plug-in uses the Geneve (Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation) protocol to create an overlay network between nodes. You can use this overlay network to connect VMs on different nodes, without having to configure any additional physical networking infrastructure.

A localnet topology connects the secondary network to the physical underlay. This enables both east-west cluster traffic and access to services running outside the cluster, but it requires additional configuration of the underlying Open vSwitch (OVS) system on cluster nodes.


An OVN-Kubernetes secondary network is compatible with the multi-network policy API which provides the MultiNetworkPolicy custom resource definition (CRD) to control traffic flow to and from VMs. You can use the ipBlock attribute to define network policy ingress and egress rules for specific CIDR blocks.
To configure an OVN-Kubernetes secondary network and attach a VM to that network, perform the following steps:

Configure an OVN-Kubernetes secondary network by creating a network attachment definition (NAD).

Connect the VM to the OVN-Kubernetes secondary network by adding the network details to the VM specification.
Creating an OVN-Kubernetes NAD
You can create an OVN-Kubernetes layer 2 or localnet network attachment definition (NAD) by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console or the CLI.

Configuring IP address management (IPAM) in a network attachment definition for virtual machines is not supported.
Creating a NAD for layer 2 topology using the CLI
You can create a network attachment definition (NAD) which describes how to attach a pod to the layer 2 overlay network.

You have access to the cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).


Create a NetworkAttachmentDefinition object:

Apply the manifest:
Creating a NAD for localnet topology using the CLI
You can create a network attachment definition (NAD) which describes how to attach a pod to the underlying physical network.

You have access to the cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You have installed the Kubernetes NMState Operator.

You have created a NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy object to map the OVN-Kubernetes secondary network to an Open vSwitch (OVS) bridge.


Create a NetworkAttachmentDefinition object:

Apply the manifest:
Attaching a virtual machine to the OVN-Kubernetes secondary network
You can attach a virtual machine (VM) to the OVN-Kubernetes secondary network interface by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console or the CLI.

Attaching a virtual machine to an OVN-Kubernetes secondary network using the CLI
You can connect a virtual machine (VM) to the OVN-Kubernetes secondary network by including the network details in the VM configuration.

You have access to the cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).


Edit the VirtualMachine manifest to add the OVN-Kubernetes secondary network interface details, as in the following example:

Apply the VirtualMachine manifest:

Optional: If you edited a running virtual machine, you must restart it for the changes to take effect.
Creating a NAD for layer 2 topology by using the web console
You can create a network attachment definition (NAD) that describes how to attach a pod to the layer 2 overlay network.

You have access to the cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.


Go to Networking -> NetworkAttachmentDefinitions in the web console.

Click Create Network Attachment Definition. The network attachment definition must be in the same namespace as the pod or virtual machine using it.

Enter a unique Name and optional Description.

Select OVN Kubernetes L2 overlay network from the Network Type list.

Click Create.
Creating a NAD for localnet topology using the web console
You can create a network attachment definition (NAD) to connect workloads to a physical network by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

You have access to the cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

Use nmstate to configure the localnet to OVS bridge mappings.


Navigate to Networking -> NetworkAttachmentDefinitions in the web console.

Click Create Network Attachment Definition. The network attachment definition must be in the same namespace as the pod or virtual machine using it.

Enter a unique Name and optional Description.

Select OVN Kubernetes secondary localnet network from the Network Type list.

Enter the name of your pre-configured localnet identifier in the Bridge mapping field.

Optional: You can explicitly set MTU to the specified value. The default value is chosen by the kernel.

Optional: Encapsulate the traffic in a VLAN. The default value is none.

Click Create.
