Creating a Windows MachineSet object on Nutanix

You can create a Windows MachineSet object to serve a specific purpose in your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on Nutanix. For example, you might create infrastructure Windows machine sets and related machines so that you can move supporting Windows workloads to the new Windows machines.


You installed the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

You are using a supported Windows Server as the operating system image.

You added a new DNS entry for the internal API server URL, api-int.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>, that points to the external API server URL, api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>. This can be a CNAME or an additional A record.
Machine API overview
The Machine API is a combination of primary resources that are based on the upstream Cluster API project and custom Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform resources.

For Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15 clusters, the Machine API performs all node host provisioning management actions after the cluster installation finishes. Because of this system, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15 offers an elastic, dynamic provisioning method on top of public or private cloud infrastructure.

The two primary resources are:


Machines
A fundamental unit that describes the host for a node. A machine has a providerSpec specification, which describes the types of compute nodes that are offered for different cloud platforms. For example, a machine type for a compute node might define a specific machine type and required metadata.
Machine sets
MachineSet resources are groups of compute machines. Compute machine sets are to compute machines as replica sets are to pods. If you need more compute machines or must scale them down, you change the replicas field on the MachineSet resource to meet your compute need.


The following custom resources add more capabilities to your cluster:


Machine autoscaler
The MachineAutoscaler resource automatically scales compute machines in a cloud. You can set the minimum and maximum scaling boundaries for nodes in a specified compute machine set, and the machine autoscaler maintains that range of nodes.
Cluster autoscaler
This resource is based on the upstream cluster autoscaler project. In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform implementation, it is integrated with the Machine API by extending the compute machine set API. You can use the cluster autoscaler to manage your cluster in the following ways:
Machine health check
The MachineHealthCheck resource detects when a machine is unhealthy, deletes it, and, on supported platforms, makes a new machine.


In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 3.11, you could not roll out a multi-zone architecture easily because the cluster did not manage machine provisioning. Beginning with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.1, this process is easier. Each compute machine set is scoped to a single zone, so the installation program sends out compute machine sets across availability zones on your behalf. And then because your compute is dynamic, and in the face of a zone failure, you always have a zone for when you must rebalance your machines. In global Azure regions that do not have multiple availability zones, you can use availability sets to ensure high availability. The autoscaler provides best-effort balancing over the life of a cluster.

Specify the infrastructure ID that is based on the cluster ID that you set when you provisioned the cluster. You can obtain the infrastructure ID by running the following command:

Specify the infrastructure ID, worker label, and zone.

Configure the compute machine set as a Windows machine.

Configure the Windows node as a compute machine.

Specifies the boot type that the compute machines use. For more information about boot types, see Understanding UEFI, Secure Boot, and TPM in the Virtualized Environment. Valid values are Legacy, SecureBoot, or UEFI. The default is Legacy.

Specifies a Nutanix Prism Element cluster configuration. In this example, the cluster type is uuid, so there is a uuid stanza.

Specifies the secret name for the cluster. Do not change this value.

Specifies the image to use. Use an image from an existing default compute machine set for the cluster.

Specifies the cloud provider platform type. Do not change this value.

Specifies the amount of memory for the cluster in Gi.

Specifies a subnet configuration. In this example, the subnet type is uuid, so there is a uuid stanza.

Specifies the size of the system disk in Gi.

Specifies the name of the secret in the user data YAML file that is in the openshift-machine-api namespace. Use the value that installation program populates in the default compute machine set.

Specifies the number of vCPU sockets.

Specifies the number of vCPUs per socket.
Creating a compute machine set
In addition to the compute machine sets created by the installation program, you can create your own to dynamically manage the machine compute resources for specific workloads of your choice.

Deploy an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

Log in to oc as a user with cluster-admin permission.


Create a new YAML file that contains the compute machine set custom resource (CR) sample and is named <file_name>.yaml.

Optional: If you are not sure which value to set for a specific field, you can check an existing compute machine set from your cluster.

Create a MachineSet CR by running the following command:
