Creating a Windows machine set on AWS

You can create a Windows MachineSet object to serve a specific purpose in your "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS). For example, you might create infrastructure Windows machine sets and related machines so that you can move supporting Windows workloads to the new Windows machines.


You installed the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

You are using a supported Windows Server as the operating system image.
Machine API overview
The Machine API is a combination of primary resources that are based on the upstream Cluster API project and custom "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" resources.

For "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" {product-version} clusters, the Machine API performs all node host provisioning management actions after the cluster installation finishes. Because of this system, "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" {product-version} offers an elastic, dynamic provisioning method on top of public or private cloud infrastructure.

The two primary resources are:


Machines
A fundamental unit that describes the host for a node. A machine has a providerSpec specification, which describes the types of compute nodes that are offered for different cloud platforms. For example, a machine type for a compute node might define a specific machine type and required metadata.
Machine sets
MachineSet resources are groups of compute machines. Compute machine sets are to compute machines as replica sets are to pods. If you need more compute machines or must scale them down, you change the replicas field on the MachineSet resource to meet your compute need.


The following custom resources add more capabilities to your cluster:


Machine autoscaler
The MachineAutoscaler resource automatically scales compute machines in a cloud. You can set the minimum and maximum scaling boundaries for nodes in a specified compute machine set, and the machine autoscaler maintains that range of nodes.
Cluster autoscaler
This resource is based on the upstream cluster autoscaler project. In the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" implementation, it is integrated with the Machine API by extending the compute machine set API. You can use the cluster autoscaler to manage your cluster in the following ways:
Machine health check
The MachineHealthCheck resource detects when a machine is unhealthy, deletes it, and, on supported platforms, makes a new machine.


In "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" version 3.11, you could not roll out a multi-zone architecture easily because the cluster did not manage machine provisioning. Beginning with "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" version 4.1, this process is easier. Each compute machine set is scoped to a single zone, so the installation program sends out compute machine sets across availability zones on your behalf. And then because your compute is dynamic, and in the face of a zone failure, you always have a zone for when you must rebalance your machines. In global Azure regions that do not have multiple availability zones, you can use availability sets to ensure high availability. The autoscaler provides best-effort balancing over the life of a cluster.
Sample YAML for a Windows MachineSet object on AWS
This sample YAML defines a Windows MachineSet object running on Amazon Web Services (AWS) that the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) can react upon.

Specify the infrastructure ID that is based on the cluster ID that you set when you provisioned the cluster. You can obtain the infrastructure ID by running the following command:

Specify the infrastructure ID, worker label, and zone.

Configure the compute machine set as a Windows machine.

Configure the Windows node as a compute machine.

Specify the AMI ID of a supported Windows image with a container runtime installed.

Specify the AWS zone, like us-east-1a.

Specify the AWS region, like us-east-1.

Created by the WMCO when it is configuring the first Windows machine. After that, the windows-user-data is available for all subsequent compute machine sets to consume.
Creating a compute machine set
In addition to the compute machine sets created by the installation program, you can create your own to dynamically manage the machine compute resources for specific workloads of your choice.

Deploy an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster.

Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

Log in to oc as a user with cluster-admin permission.


Create a new YAML file that contains the compute machine set custom resource (CR) sample and is named <file_name>.yaml.

Optional: If you are not sure which value to set for a specific field, you can check an existing compute machine set from your cluster.

Create a MachineSet CR by running the following command:
