Image Registry Operator in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

Image Registry on cloud platforms and OpenStack
The Image Registry Operator installs a single instance of the OpenShift image registry, and manages all registry configuration, including setting up registry storage.

Storage is only automatically configured when you install an installer-provisioned infrastructure cluster on AWS, Azure, GCP, IBM(R), or OpenStack.

When you install or upgrade an installer-provisioned infrastructure cluster on AWS, Azure, GCP, IBM(R), or OpenStack, the Image Registry Operator sets the spec.storage.managementState parameter to Managed. If the spec.storage.managementState parameter is set to Unmanaged, the Image Registry Operator takes no action related to storage.
After the control plane deploys, the Operator creates a default configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io resource instance based on configuration detected in the cluster.

If insufficient information is available to define a complete configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io resource, the incomplete resource is defined and the Operator updates the resource status with information about what is missing.

The Image Registry Operator runs in the openshift-image-registry namespace, and manages the registry instance in that location as well. All configuration and workload resources for the registry reside in that namespace.

The Image Registry Operator's behavior for managing the pruner is orthogonal to the managementState specified on the ClusterOperator object for the Image Registry Operator. If the Image Registry Operator is not in the Managed state, the image pruner can still be configured and managed by the Pruning custom resource.

However, the managementState of the Image Registry Operator alters the behavior of the deployed image pruner job:

Managed: the --prune-registry flag for the image pruner is set to true.

Removed: the --prune-registry flag for the image pruner is set to false, meaning it only prunes image metadata in etcd.
Image Registry on bare metal, Nutanix, and vSphere
Image registry removed during installation
On platforms that do not provide shareable object storage, the OpenShift Image Registry Operator bootstraps itself as Removed. This allows openshift-installer to complete installations on these platform types.

After installation, you must edit the Image Registry Operator configuration to switch the managementState from Removed to Managed.
Image Registry Operator distribution across availability zones
The default configuration of the Image Registry Operator spreads image registry pods across topology zones to prevent delayed recovery times in case of a complete zone failure where all pods are impacted.

The Image Registry Operator defaults to the following when deployed with a zone-related topology constraint:

  topologySpreadConstraints:
  - labelSelector:
      matchLabels:
        docker-registry: default
    maxSkew: 1
    topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
    whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule
  - labelSelector:
      matchLabels:
        docker-registry: default
    maxSkew: 1
    topologyKey: node-role.kubernetes.io/worker
    whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule
  - labelSelector:
      matchLabels:
        docker-registry: default
    maxSkew: 1
    topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
    whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule
The Image Registry Operator defaults to the following when deployed without a zone-related topology constraint, which applies to bare metal and vSphere instances:

 topologySpreadConstraints:
  - labelSelector:
      matchLabels:
        docker-registry: default
    maxSkew: 1
    topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
    whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule
  - labelSelector:
      matchLabels:
        docker-registry: default
    maxSkew: 1
    topologyKey: node-role.kubernetes.io/worker
    whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule
A cluster administrator can override the default topologySpreadConstraints by configuring the configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster spec file. In that case, only the constraints you provide apply.

Image Registry Operator configuration parameters
The configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io resource offers the following configuration parameters.
Enable the Image Registry default route with the Custom Resource Definition
In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, the Registry Operator controls the OpenShift image registry feature. The Operator is defined by the configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io Custom Resource Definition (CRD).

If you need to automatically enable the Image Registry default route, patch the Image Registry Operator CRD.

Patch the Image Registry Operator CRD:
Configuring additional trust stores for image registry access
The image.config.openshift.io/cluster custom resource can contain a reference to a config map that contains additional certificate authorities to be trusted during image registry access.

The certificate authorities (CA) must be PEM-encoded.


You can create a config map in the openshift-config namespace and use its name in AdditionalTrustedCA in the image.config.openshift.io custom resource to provide additional CAs that should be trusted when contacting external registries.

The config map key is the hostname of a registry with the port for which this CA is to be trusted, and the PEM certificate content is the value, for each additional registry CA to trust.

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-registry-ca
data:
  registry.example.com: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    ...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
  registry-with-port.example.com..5000: | 1
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    ...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
If the registry has the port, such as registry-with-port.example.com:5000, : should be replaced with &#8230;&#8203;


You can configure additional CAs with the following procedure.

To configure an additional CA:
Configuring storage credentials for the Image Registry Operator
In addition to the configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io and ConfigMap resources, storage credential configuration is provided to the Operator by a separate secret resource located within the openshift-image-registry namespace.

The image-registry-private-configuration-user secret provides credentials needed for storage access and management. It overrides the default credentials used by the Operator, if default credentials were found.

Create an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform secret that contains the required keys.
