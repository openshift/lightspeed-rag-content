Configuring the registry for GCP user-provisioned infrastructure

Configuring a secret for the Image Registry Operator
In addition to the configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io and ConfigMap resources, configuration is provided to the Operator by a separate secret resource located within the openshift-image-registry namespace.

The image-registry-private-configuration-user secret provides credentials needed for storage access and management. It overrides the default credentials used by the Operator, if default credentials were found.

For GCS on GCP storage, the secret is expected to contain one key whose value is the contents of a credentials file provided by GCP:

REGISTRY_STORAGE_GCS_KEYFILE


Create an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform secret that contains the required keys.
