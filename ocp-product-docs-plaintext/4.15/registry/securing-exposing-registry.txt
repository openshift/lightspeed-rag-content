Exposing the registry

By default, the OpenShift image registry is secured during cluster installation so that it serves traffic through TLS. Unlike previous versions of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, the registry is not exposed outside of the cluster at the time of installation.
Exposing a default registry manually
Instead of logging in to the default OpenShift image registry from within the cluster, you can gain external access to it by exposing it with a route. This external access enables you to log in to the registry from outside the cluster using the route address and to tag and push images to an existing project by using the route host.

The following prerequisites are automatically performed:

You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.


You can expose the route by using the defaultRoute parameter in the configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io resource.

To expose the registry using the defaultRoute:

Set defaultRoute to true:

Get the default registry route:

Get the certificate of the Ingress Operator:

Enable the cluster's default certificate to trust the route using the following commands:

Log in with podman using the default route:

You can expose the route by using DefaultRoute parameter in the configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io resource or by using custom routes.

To expose the registry using DefaultRoute:

Set DefaultRoute to True:

Log in with podman:


To expose the registry using custom routes:

Create a secret with your route's TLS keys:
