Installing Operators in your namespace

If a cluster administrator has delegated Operator installation permissions to your account, you can install and subscribe an Operator to your namespace in a self-service manner.
Prerequisites
A cluster administrator must add certain permissions to your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform user account to allow self-service Operator installation to a namespace. See Allowing non-cluster administrators to install Operators for details.
About Operator installation with OperatorHub
OperatorHub is a user interface for discovering Operators; it works in conjunction with Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), which installs and manages Operators on a cluster.

As a user with the proper permissions, you can install an Operator from OperatorHub by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console or CLI.

During installation, you must determine the following initial settings for the Operator:


Installation Mode
Choose a specific namespace in which to install the Operator.
Update Channel
If an Operator is available through multiple channels, you can choose which channel you want to subscribe to. For example, to deploy from the stable channel, if available, select it from the list.
Approval Strategy
You can choose automatic or manual updates.


Understanding OperatorHub
Installing from OperatorHub using the web console
You can install and subscribe to an Operator from OperatorHub by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

Access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster using an account with Operator installation permissions.


Navigate in the web console to the Operators → OperatorHub page.

Scroll or type a keyword into the Filter by keyword box to find the Operator you want. For example, type advanced to find the Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes Operator.

Select the Operator to display additional information.

Read the information about the Operator and click Install.

On the Install Operator page:

Click Install to make the Operator available to the selected namespaces on this Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

After the upgrade status of the subscription is Up to date, select Operators → Installed Operators to verify that the cluster service version (CSV) of the installed Operator eventually shows up. The Status should ultimately resolve to InstallSucceeded in the relevant namespace.
