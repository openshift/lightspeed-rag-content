Installing an Operator from a catalog in OLM 1.0 (Technology Preview)

Cluster administrators can add catalogs, or curated collections of Operators and Kubernetes extensions, to their clusters. Operator authors publish their products to these catalogs. When you add a catalog to your cluster, you have access to the versions, patches, and over-the-air updates of the Operators and extensions that are published to the catalog.

In the current Technology Preview release of Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) 1.0, you manage catalogs and Operators declaratively from the CLI using custom resources (CRs).

OLM 1.0 is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
Prerequisites

About catalogs in OLM 1.0
You can discover installable content by querying a catalog for Kubernetes extensions, such as Operators and controllers, by using the catalogd component. Catalogd is a Kubernetes extension that unpacks catalog content for on-cluster clients and is part of the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) 1.0 suite of microservices. Currently, catalogd unpacks catalog content that is packaged and distributed as container images.

If you try to install an Operator or extension that does not have unique name, the installation might fail or lead to an unpredictable result. This occurs for the following reasons:

If mulitple catalogs are installed on a cluster, OLM 1.0 does not include a mechanism to specify a catalog when you install an Operator or extension.

Dependency resolution in Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) 1.0 requires that all of the Operators and extensions that are available to install on a cluster use a unique name for their bundles and packages.
File-based catalogs
Red Hat-provided Operator catalogs in OLM 1.0
Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) 1.0 does not include Red Hat-provided Operator catalogs by default. If you want to add a Red Hat-provided catalog to your cluster, create a custom resource (CR) for the catalog and apply it to the cluster. The following custom resource (CR) examples show how to create a catalog resources for OLM 1.0.

If you want to use a catalog that is hosted on a secure registry, such as Red Hat-provided Operator catalogs from registry.redhat.io, you must have a pull secret scoped to the openshift-catalogd namespace. For more information, see "Creating a pull secret for catalogs hosted on a secure registry".
apiVersion: catalogd.operatorframework.io/v1alpha1
kind: Catalog
metadata:
  name: redhat-operators
spec:
  source:
    type: image
    image:
      ref: registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.15
      pullSecret: <pull_secret_name>
      pollInterval: <poll_interval_duration> 1
Specify the interval for polling the remote registry for newer image digests. The default value is 24h. Valid units include seconds (s), minutes (m), and hours (h). To disable polling, set a zero value, such as 0s.


apiVersion: catalogd.operatorframework.io/v1alpha1
kind: Catalog
metadata:
  name: certified-operators
spec:
  source:
    type: image
    image:
      ref: registry.redhat.io/redhat/certified-operator-index:v4.15
      pullSecret: <pull_secret_name>
      pollInterval: 24h
apiVersion: catalogd.operatorframework.io/v1alpha1
kind: Catalog
metadata:
  name: community-operators
spec:
  source:
    type: image
    image:
      ref: registry.redhat.io/redhat/community-operator-index:v4.15
      pullSecret: <pull_secret_name>
      pollInterval: 24h
The following command adds a catalog to your cluster:

$ oc apply -f <catalog_name>.yaml 1
Specifies the catalog CR, such as redhat-operators.yaml.

About Red Hat-provided Operator catalogs
Creating a pull secret for catalogs hosted on a secure registry
If you want to use a catalog that is hosted on a secure registry, such as Red Hat-provided Operator catalogs from registry.redhat.io, you must have a pull secret scoped to the openshift-catalogd namespace.

Currently, catalogd cannot read global pull secrets from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters. Catalogd can read references to secrets only in the namespace where it is deployed.
Login credentials for the secure registry

Docker or Podman installed on your workstation


If you already have a .dockercfg file with login credentials for the secure registry, create a pull secret by running the following command:

If you already have a $HOME/.docker/config.json file with login credentials for the secured registry, create a pull secret by running the following command:

If you do not have a Docker configuration file with login credentials for the secure registry, create a pull secret by running the following command:

Installing an Operator from a catalog
Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) 1.0 supports installing Operators and extensions scoped to the cluster. You can install an Operator or extension from a catalog by creating a custom resource (CR) and applying it to the cluster.

Currently, OLM 1.0 supports the installation Operators and extensions that meet the following criteria:

The Operator or extension must use the AllNamespaces install mode.

The Operator or extension must not use webhooks.


Operators and extensions that use webhooks or that target a single or specified set of namespaces cannot be installed.
You have added a catalog to your cluster.

You have downloaded a local copy of the catalog file.

You have installed the jq CLI tool.

Example custom resources (CRs) that specify a target version

Version comparison strings


Support for semantic versioning
Support for semantic versioning (semver) is enabled in OLM 1.0 by default. Operator and extension authors can use the semver standard to define compatible updates.

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) 1.0 can use an Operator or extension's version number to determine if an update can be resolved successfully.

Cluster administrators can define a range of acceptable versions to install and automtically update. For Operators and extensions that follow the semver standard, you can use comparison strings to define to specify a desired version range.

OLM 1.0 does not support automatic updates to the next major version. If you want to perform a major version update, you must verify and apply the update manually. For more information, see "Forcing an update or rollback".
Major version zero releases
The semver standard specifies that major version zero releases (O.y.z) are reserved for initial development. During the initial development stage, the API is not stable and breaking changes might be introduced in any published version. As a result, major version zero releases apply a special set of update conditions.

You cannot apply automatic updates when the major and minor versions are both zero, such as 0.0.*. For example, automatic updates with the version range of >=0.0.1 <0.1.0 are not allowed.

You cannot apply automatic updates from one minor version to another within a major version zero release. For example, OLM 1.0 does not automatically apply an update from 0.1.0 to 0.2.0.

You can apply automatic updates from patch versions, such as >=0.1.0 <0.2.0 or >=0.2.0 <0.3.0.


When an automatic update is blocked by OLM 1.0, you must manually verify and force the update by editing the Operator or extension's custom resource (CR).

Forcing an update or rollback
Support for version ranges
In Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) 1.0, you can specify a version range by using a comparison string in an Operator or extension's custom resource (CR). If you specify a version range in the CR, OLM 1.0 installs or updates to the latest version of the Operator that can be resolved within the version range.

The resolved version is the latest version of the Operator that satisfies the dependencies and constraints of the Operator and the environment.

An Operator update within the specified range is automatically installed if it is resolved successfully.

An update is not installed if it is outside of the specified range or if it cannot be resolved successfully.


For more information about dependency and constraint resolution in OLM 1.0, see "Dependency resolution in OLM 1.0".

Dependency resolution in OLM 1.0
Version comparison strings
You can define a version range by adding a comparison string to the spec.version field in an Operator or extension's custom resource (CR). A comparison string is a list of space- or comma-separated values and one or more comparison operators enclosed in double quotation marks ("). You can add another comparison string by including an OR, or double vertical bar (||), comparison operator between the strings.


You can specify a version range in an Operator or extension's CR by using a range comparison similar to the following example:

apiVersion: operators.operatorframework.io/v1alpha1
kind: Operator
metadata:
  name: pipelines-operator
spec:
  packageName: openshift-pipelines-operator-rh
  version: ">=1.11, <1.13"
You can use wildcard characters in all types of comparison strings. OLM 1.0 accepts x, X, and asterisks (*) as wildcard characters. When you use a wildcard character with the equal sign (=) comparison operator, you define a comparison at the patch or minor version level.


You can make patch release comparisons by using the tilde (~) comparison operator. Patch release comparisons specify a minor version up to the next major version.


You can use the caret (^) comparison operator to make a comparison for a major release. If you use a major release comparison before the first stable release is published, the minor versions define the API's level of stability. In the semantic versioning (SemVer) specification, the first stable release is published as the 1.0.0 version.
Example custom resources (CRs) that specify a target version
In Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) 1.0, cluster administrators can declaratively set the target version of an Operator or extension in the custom resource (CR).

You can define a target version by specifying any of the following fields:

Channel

Version number

Version range


If you specify a channel in the CR, OLM 1.0 installs the latest version of the Operator or extension that can be resolved within the specified channel. When updates are published to the specified channel, OLM 1.0 automatically updates to the latest release that can be resolved from the channel.

apiVersion: operators.operatorframework.io/v1alpha1
kind: Operator
metadata:
  name: pipelines-operator
spec:
  packageName: openshift-pipelines-operator-rh
  channel: latest 1
Installs the latest release that can be resolved from the specified channel. Updates to the channel are automatically installed.


If you specify the Operator or extension's target version in the CR, OLM 1.0 installs the specified version. When the target version is specified in the CR, OLM 1.0 does not change the target version when updates are published to the catalog.

If you want to update the version of the Operator that is installed on the cluster, you must manually edit the Operator's CR. Specifying an Operator's target version pins the Operator's version to the specified release.

apiVersion: operators.operatorframework.io/v1alpha1
kind: Operator
metadata:
  name: pipelines-operator
spec:
  packageName: openshift-pipelines-operator-rh
  version: 1.11.1 1
Specifies the target version. If you want to update the version of the Operator or extension that is installed, you must manually update this field the CR to the desired target version.


If you want to define a range of acceptable versions for an Operator or extension, you can specify a version range by using a comparison string. When you specify a version range, OLM 1.0 installs the latest version of an Operator or extension that can be resolved by the Operator Controller.

apiVersion: operators.operatorframework.io/v1alpha1
kind: Operator
metadata:
  name: pipelines-operator
spec:
  packageName: openshift-pipelines-operator-rh
  version: >1.11.1 1
Specifies that the desired version range is greater than version 1.11.1. For more information, see "Support for version ranges".


After you create or update a CR, apply the configuration file by running the following command:

$ oc apply -f <extension_name>.yaml
Forcing an update or rollback
OLM 1.0 does not support automatic updates to the next major version or rollbacks to an earlier version. If you want to perform a major version update or rollback, you must verify and force the update manually.

You must verify the consequences of forcing a manual update or rollback. Failure to verify a forced update or rollback might have catastrophic consequences such as data loss.
