Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) 1.0 comprises the following component projects:

Operator Controller:: Operator Controller is the central component of OLM 1.0 that extends Kubernetes with an API through which users can install and manage the lifecycle of Operators and extensions. It consumes information from each of the following components.
RukPak:: RukPak is a pluggable solution for packaging and distributing cloud-native content. It supports advanced strategies for installation, updates, and policy.

RukPak provides a content ecosystem for installing a variety of artifacts on a Kubernetes cluster. Artifact examples include Git repositories, Helm charts, and OLM bundles. RukPak can then manage, scale, and upgrade these artifacts in a safe way to enable powerful cluster extensions.
Catalogd:: Catalogd is a Kubernetes extension that unpacks file-based catalog (FBC) content packaged and shipped in container images for consumption by on-cluster clients. As a component of the OLM 1.0 microservices architecture, catalogd hosts metadata for Kubernetes extensions packaged by the authors of the extensions, and as a result helps users discover installable content.
