CCO-based workflow for OLM-managed Operators with Microsoft Entra Workload ID

When an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster running on Azure is in Workload Identity / Federated Identity mode, it means the cluster is utilizing features of Azure and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform to apply user-assigned managed identities or app registrations in Microsoft Entra Workload ID at an application level.

The Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) is a cluster Operator installed by default in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters running on cloud providers. Starting in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14.8, the CCO supports workflows for OLM-managed Operators with Workload ID.

For the purposes of Workload ID, the CCO provides the following functions:

Detects when it is running on an Workload ID-enabled cluster

Checks for the presence of fields in the CredentialsRequest object that provide the required information for granting Operators access to Azure resources


The CCO can semi-automate this process through an expanded use of CredentialsRequest objects, which can request the creation of Secrets that contain the information required for Workload ID workflows.

Subscriptions with automatic update approvals are not recommended because there might be permission changes to make prior to updating. Subscriptions with manual update approvals ensure that administrators have the opportunity to verify the permissions of the later version and take any necessary steps prior to update.
As an Operator author preparing an Operator for use alongside the updated CCO in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14 and later, you should instruct users and add code to handle the divergence from earlier CCO versions, in addition to handling Workload ID token authentication (if your Operator is not already enabled). The recommended method is to provide a CredentialsRequest object with correctly filled Workload ID-related fields and let the CCO create the Secret object for you.

If you plan to support Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters earlier than version 4.14, consider providing users with instructions on how to manually create a secret with the Workload ID-enabling information by using the CCO utility (ccoctl). Earlier CCO versions are unaware of Workload ID mode on the cluster and cannot create secrets for you.

Your code should check for secrets that never appear and warn users to follow the fallback instructions you have provided.
Authentication with Workload ID requires the following information:

azure_client_id

azure_tenant_id

azure_region

azure_subscription_id

azure_federated_token_file


The Install Operator page in the web console allows cluster administrators to provide this information at installation time. This information is then propagated to the Subscription object as environment variables on the Operator pod.

Enabling Operators to support CCO-based workflows with Microsoft Entra Workload ID
As an Operator author designing your project to run on Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), you can enable your Operator to authenticate against Microsoft Entra Workload ID-enabled Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters by customizing your project to support the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO).

With this method, the Operator is responsible for creating the CredentialsRequest object, which means the Operator requires RBAC permission to create these objects. Then, the Operator must be able to read the resulting Secret object.

By default, pods related to the Operator deployment mount a serviceAccountToken volume so that the service account token can be referenced in the resulting Secret object.
