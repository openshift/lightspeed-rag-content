Token authentication for Operators on cloud providers

Many cloud providers can enable authentication by using account tokens that provide short-term, limited-privilege security credentials.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform includes the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) to manage cloud provider credentials as custom resource definitions (CRDs). The CCO syncs on CredentialsRequest custom resources (CRs) to allow Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform components to request cloud provider credentials with any specific permissions required.

Previously, on clusters where the CCO is in manual mode, Operators managed by Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) often provided detailed instructions in the OperatorHub for how users could manually provision any required cloud credentials.

Starting in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14, the CCO can detect when it is running on clusters enabled to use short-term credentials on certain cloud providers. It can then semi-automate provisioning certain credentials, provided that the Operator author has enabled their Operator to support the updated CCO.
