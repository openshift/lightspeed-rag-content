Migrating package manifest projects to bundle format

Support for the legacy package manifest format for Operators is removed in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.8 and later. If you have an Operator project that was initially created using the package manifest format, you can use the Operator SDK to migrate the project to the bundle format. The bundle format is the preferred packaging format for Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) starting in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.6.
About packaging format migration
The Operator SDK pkgman-to-bundle command helps in migrating Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) package manifests to bundles. The command takes an input package manifest directory and generates bundles for each of the versions of manifests present in the input directory. You can also then build bundle images for each of the generated bundles.

For example, consider the following packagemanifests/ directory for a project in the package manifest format:

packagemanifests/
└── etcd
    ├── 0.0.1
    │   ├── etcdcluster.crd.yaml
    │   └── etcdoperator.clusterserviceversion.yaml
    ├── 0.0.2
    │   ├── etcdbackup.crd.yaml
    │   ├── etcdcluster.crd.yaml
    │   ├── etcdoperator.v0.0.2.clusterserviceversion.yaml
    │   └── etcdrestore.crd.yaml
    └── etcd.package.yaml
After running the migration, the following bundles are generated in the bundle/ directory:

bundle/
├── bundle-0.0.1
│   ├── bundle.Dockerfile
│   ├── manifests
│   │   ├── etcdcluster.crd.yaml
│   │   ├── etcdoperator.clusterserviceversion.yaml
│   ├── metadata
│   │   └── annotations.yaml
│   └── tests
│       └── scorecard
│           └── config.yaml
└── bundle-0.0.2
    ├── bundle.Dockerfile
    ├── manifests
    │   ├── etcdbackup.crd.yaml
    │   ├── etcdcluster.crd.yaml
    │   ├── etcdoperator.v0.0.2.clusterserviceversion.yaml
    │   ├── etcdrestore.crd.yaml
    ├── metadata
    │   └── annotations.yaml
    └── tests
        └── scorecard
            └── config.yaml
Based on this generated layout, bundle images for both of the bundles are also built with the following names:

quay.io/example/etcd:0.0.1

quay.io/example/etcd:0.0.2
