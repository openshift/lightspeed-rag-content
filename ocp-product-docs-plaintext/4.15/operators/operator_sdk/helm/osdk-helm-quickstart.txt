Getting started with Operator SDK for Helm-based Operators

The Operator SDK includes options for generating an Operator project that leverages existing Helm charts to deploy Kubernetes resources as a unified application, without having to write any Go code.

To demonstrate the basics of setting up and running an Helm-based Operator using tools and libraries provided by the Operator SDK, Operator developers can build an example Helm-based Operator for Nginx and deploy it to a cluster.
Prerequisites
Operator SDK CLI installed

OpenShift CLI (oc) 4.15+ installed

Logged into an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15 cluster with oc with an account that has cluster-admin permissions

To allow the cluster to pull the image, the repository where you push your image must be set as public, or you must configure an image pull secret
