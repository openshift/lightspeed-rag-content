Getting started with Operator SDK for Java-based Operators
Java-based Operator SDK is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.

To demonstrate the basics of setting up and running a Java-based Operator using tools and libraries provided by the Operator SDK, Operator developers can build an example Java-based Operator for Memcached, a distributed key-value store, and deploy it to a cluster.
Prerequisites
Operator SDK CLI installed

OpenShift CLI (oc) "4.15"+ installed

Java 11+

Maven 3.6.3+

Logged into an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" "4.15" cluster with oc with an account that has cluster-admin permissions

To allow the cluster to pull the image, the repository where you push your image must be set as public, or you must configure an image pull secret
