Updating projects for newer Operator SDK versions

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15 supports Operator SDK 1.31.0. If you already have the 1.28.0 CLI installed on your workstation, you can update the CLI to 1.31.0 by installing the latest version.

However, to ensure your existing Operator projects maintain compatibility with Operator SDK 1.31.0, update steps are required for the associated breaking changes introduced since 1.28.0. You must perform the update steps manually in any of your Operator projects that were previously created or maintained with 1.28.0.
