Getting started with Operator SDK for Ansible-based Operators

The Operator SDK includes options for generating an Operator project that leverages existing Ansible playbooks and modules to deploy Kubernetes resources as a unified application, without having to write any Go code.

To demonstrate the basics of setting up and running an Ansible-based Operator using tools and libraries provided by the Operator SDK, Operator developers can build an example Ansible-based Operator for Memcached, a distributed key-value store, and deploy it to a cluster.
Prerequisites
Operator SDK CLI installed

OpenShift CLI (oc) "4.15"+ installed

Ansible 2.15.0

Ansible Runner 2.3.3+

Ansible Runner HTTP Event Emitter plugin 1.0.0+

Python 3.9+

Python Kubernetes client

Logged into an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" "4.15" cluster with oc with an account that has cluster-admin permissions

To allow the cluster to pull the image, the repository where you push your image must be set as public, or you must configure an image pull secret
