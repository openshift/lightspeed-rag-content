Getting started with Operator SDK for Go-based Operators

To demonstrate the basics of setting up and running a Go-based Operator using tools and libraries provided by the Operator SDK, Operator developers can build an example Go-based Operator for Memcached, a distributed key-value store, and deploy it to a cluster.
Prerequisites
Operator SDK CLI installed

OpenShift CLI (oc) 4.15+ installed

Go 1.19+

Logged into an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15 cluster with oc with an account that has cluster-admin permissions

To allow the cluster to pull the image, the repository where you push your image must be set as public, or you must configure an image pull secret
