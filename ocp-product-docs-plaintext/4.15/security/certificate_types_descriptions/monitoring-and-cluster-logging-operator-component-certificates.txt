Monitoring and OpenShift Logging Operator component certificates

Expiration
Monitoring components secure their traffic with service CA certificates. These certificates are valid for 2 years and are replaced automatically on rotation of the service CA, which is every 13 months.

If the certificate lives in the openshift-monitoring or openshift-logging namespace, it is system managed and rotated automatically.
Management
These certificates are managed by the system and not the user.
