Bootstrap certificates

Purpose
The kubelet, in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 and later, uses the bootstrap certificate located in /etc/kubernetes/kubeconfig to initially bootstrap. This is followed by the bootstrap initialization process and authorization of the kubelet to create a CSR.

In that process, the kubelet generates a CSR while communicating over the bootstrap channel. The controller manager signs the CSR, resulting in a certificate that the kubelet manages.
Management
These certificates are managed by the system and not the user.
Expiration
This bootstrap certificate is valid for 10 years.

The kubelet-managed certificate is valid for one year and rotates automatically at around the 80 percent mark of that one year.

OpenShift Lifecycle Manager (OLM) does not update the bootstrap certificate.
Customization
You cannot customize the bootstrap certificates.
