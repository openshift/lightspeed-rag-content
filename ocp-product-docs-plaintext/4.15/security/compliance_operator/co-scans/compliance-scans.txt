Compliance Operator scans

The ScanSetting and ScanSettingBinding APIs are recommended to run compliance scans with the Compliance Operator. For more information on these API objects, run:

$ oc explain scansettings
or

$ oc explain scansettingbindings
Running compliance scans
You can run a scan using the Center for Internet Security (CIS) profiles. For convenience, the Compliance Operator creates a ScanSetting object with reasonable defaults on startup. This ScanSetting object is named default.

For all-in-one control plane and worker nodes, the compliance scan runs twice on the worker and control plane nodes. The compliance scan might generate inconsistent scan results. You can avoid inconsistent results by defining only a single role in the ScanSetting object.
Inspect the ScanSetting object by running:

Create a ScanSettingBinding object that binds to the default ScanSetting object and scans the cluster using the cis and cis-node profiles. For example:

Create the ScanSettingBinding object by running:

Follow the compliance scan progress by running:
Scheduling the result server pod on a worker node
The result server pod mounts the persistent volume (PV) that stores the raw Asset Reporting Format (ARF) scan results. The nodeSelector and tolerations attributes enable you to configure the location of the result server pod.

This is helpful for those environments where control plane nodes are not permitted to mount persistent volumes.

Create a ScanSetting custom resource (CR) for the Compliance Operator:


To verify that the ScanSetting object is created, run the following command:
ScanSetting Custom Resource
The ScanSetting Custom Resource now allows you to override the default CPU and memory limits of scanner pods through the scan limits attribute. The Compliance Operator will use defaults of 500Mi memory, 100m CPU for the scanner container, and 200Mi memory with 100m CPU for the api-resource-collector container. To set the memory limits of the Operator, modify the Subscription object if installed through OLM or the Operator deployment itself.

To increase the default CPU and memory limits of the Compliance Operator, see Increasing Compliance Operator resource limits.

Increasing the memory limit for the Compliance Operator or the scanner pods is needed if the default limits are not sufficient and the Operator or scanner pods are ended by the Out Of Memory (OOM) process.
Configuring the Hosted control planes management cluster
If you are hosting your own Hosted control plane or Hypershift environment and want to scan a Hosted Cluster from the management cluster, you will need to set the name and prefix namespace for the target Hosted Cluster. You can achieve this by creating a TailoredProfile.

This procedure only applies to users managing their own Hosted control planes environment.
Only ocp4-cis and ocp4-pci-dss profiles are supported in Hosted control planes management clusters.
The Compliance Operator is installed in the management cluster.


Obtain the name and namespace of the hosted cluster to be scanned by running the following command:

In the management cluster, create a TailoredProfile extending the scan Profile and define the name and namespace of the Hosted Cluster to be scanned:

Create the TailoredProfile:
Applying resource requests and limits
When the kubelet starts a container as part of a Pod, the kubelet passes that container's requests and limits for memory and CPU to the container runtime. In Linux, the container runtime configures the kernel cgroups that apply and enforce the limits you defined.

The CPU limit defines how much CPU time the container can use. During each scheduling interval, the Linux kernel checks to see if this limit is exceeded. If so, the kernel waits before allowing the cgroup to resume execution.

If several different containers (cgroups) want to run on a contended system, workloads with larger CPU requests are allocated more CPU time than workloads with small requests. The memory request is used during Pod scheduling. On a node that uses cgroups v2, the container runtime might use the memory request as a hint to set memory.min and memory.low values.

If a container attempts to allocate more memory than this limit, the Linux kernel out-of-memory subsystem activates and intervenes by stopping one of the processes in the container that tried to allocate memory. The memory limit for the Pod or container can also apply to pages in memory-backed volumes, such as an emptyDir.

The kubelet tracks tmpfs emptyDir volumes as container memory is used, rather than as local ephemeral storage. If a container exceeds its memory request and the node that it runs on becomes short of memory overall, the Pod's container might be evicted.

A container may not exceed its CPU limit for extended periods. Container run times do not stop Pods or containers for excessive CPU usage. To determine whether a container cannot be scheduled or is being killed due to resource limits, see Troubleshooting the Compliance Operator.
Scheduling Pods with container resource requests
When a Pod is created, the scheduler selects a Node for the Pod to run on. Each node has a maximum capacity for each resource type in the amount of CPU and memory it can provide for the Pods. The scheduler ensures that the sum of the resource requests of the scheduled containers is less than the capacity nodes for each resource type.

Although memory or CPU resource usage on nodes is very low, the scheduler might still refuse to place a Pod on a node if the capacity check fails to protect against a resource shortage on a node.

For each container, you can specify the following resource limits and request:

spec.containers[].resources.limits.cpu
spec.containers[].resources.limits.memory
spec.containers[].resources.limits.hugepages-<size>
spec.containers[].resources.requests.cpu
spec.containers[].resources.requests.memory
spec.containers[].resources.requests.hugepages-<size>
Although you can specify requests and limits for only individual containers, it is also useful to consider the overall resource requests and limits for a pod. For a particular resource, a container resource request or limit is the sum of the resource requests or limits of that type for each container in the pod.
