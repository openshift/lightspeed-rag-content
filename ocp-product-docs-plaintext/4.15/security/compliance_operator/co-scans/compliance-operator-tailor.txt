Tailoring the Compliance Operator

While the Compliance Operator comes with ready-to-use profiles, they must be modified to fit the organizations’ needs and requirements. The process of modifying a profile is called tailoring.

The Compliance Operator provides the TailoredProfile object to help tailor profiles.
Creating a new tailored profile
You can write a tailored profile from scratch by using the TailoredProfile object. Set an appropriate title and description and leave the extends field empty. Indicate to the Compliance Operator what type of scan this custom profile will generate:

Node scan: Scans the Operating System.

Platform scan: Scans the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" configuration.


Set the following annotation on the TailoredProfile object:


apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: TailoredProfile
metadata:
  name: new-profile
  annotations:
    compliance.openshift.io/product-type: Node 1
spec:
  extends: ocp4-cis-node 2
  description: My custom profile 3
  title: Custom profile 4
  enableRules:
    - name: ocp4-etcd-unique-ca
      rationale: We really need to enable this
  disableRules:
    - name: ocp4-file-groupowner-cni-conf
      rationale: This does not apply to the cluster
Set Node or Platform accordingly.

The extends field is optional.

Use the description field to describe the function of the new TailoredProfile object.

Give your TailoredProfile object a title with the title field.
Using tailored profiles to extend existing ProfileBundles
While the TailoredProfile CR enables the most common tailoring operations, the XCCDF standard allows even more flexibility in tailoring OpenSCAP profiles. In addition, if your organization has been using OpenScap previously, you may have an existing XCCDF tailoring file and can reuse it.

The ComplianceSuite object contains an optional TailoringConfigMap attribute that you can point to a custom tailoring file. The value of the TailoringConfigMap attribute is a name of a config map, which must contain a key called tailoring.xml and the value of this key is the tailoring contents.

Create a tailored profile named nist-moderate-modified:

Define the ScanSettingBinding object to bind the new nist-moderate-modified tailored profile to the default ScanSetting object.
