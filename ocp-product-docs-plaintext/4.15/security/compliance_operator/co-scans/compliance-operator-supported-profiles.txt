Supported compliance profiles
There are several profiles available as part of the Compliance Operator (CO) installation. While you can use the following profiles to assess gaps in a cluster, usage alone does not infer or guarantee compliance with a particular profile and is not an auditor.

In order to be compliant or certified under these various standards, you need to engage an authorized auditor such as a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA), Joint Authorization Board (JAB), or other industry recognized regulatory authority to assess your environment. You are required to work with an authorized auditor to achieve compliance with a standard.

The Compliance Operator might report incorrect results on managed platforms, such as OpenShift Dedicated, Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS, and Azure Red Hat OpenShift. For more information, see the Red Hat Knowledgebase Solution #6983418.

About extended compliance profiles
Some compliance profiles have controls that require following industry best practices, resulting in some profiles extending others. Combining the Center for Internet Security (CIS) best practices with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) security frameworks establishes a path to a secure and compliant environment.

For example, the NIST High-Impact and Moderate-Impact profiles extend the CIS profile to achieve compliance. As a result, extended compliance profiles eliminate the need to run both profiles in a single cluster.
