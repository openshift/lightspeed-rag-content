Understanding the Compliance Operator

The Compliance Operator lets Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform administrators describe the required compliance state of a cluster and provides them with an overview of gaps and ways to remediate them. The Compliance Operator assesses compliance of both the Kubernetes API resources of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, as well as the nodes running the cluster. The Compliance Operator uses OpenSCAP, a NIST-certified tool, to scan and enforce security policies provided by the content.

The Compliance Operator is available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) deployments only.

Compliance Operator profile types
There are two types of compliance profiles available: Platform and Node.


Platform
Platform scans target your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
Node
Node scans target the nodes of the cluster.


For compliance profiles that have Node and Platform applications, such as pci-dss compliance profiles, you must run both in your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform environment.
