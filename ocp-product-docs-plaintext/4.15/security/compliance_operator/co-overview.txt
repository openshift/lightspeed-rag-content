Compliance Operator overview
The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Compliance Operator assists users by automating the inspection of numerous technical implementations and compares those against certain aspects of industry standards, benchmarks, and baselines; the Compliance Operator is not an auditor. In order to be compliant or certified under these various standards, you need to engage an authorized auditor such as a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA), Joint Authorization Board (JAB), or other industry recognized regulatory authority to assess your environment.

The Compliance Operator makes recommendations based on generally available information and practices regarding such standards and may assist with remediations, but actual compliance is your responsibility. You are required to work with an authorized auditor to achieve compliance with a standard. For the latest updates, see the Compliance Operator release notes
