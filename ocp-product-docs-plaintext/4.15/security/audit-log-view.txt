Viewing audit logs

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform auditing provides a security-relevant chronological set of records documenting the sequence of activities that have affected the system by individual users, administrators, or other components of the system.
About the API audit log
Audit works at the API server level, logging all requests coming to the server. Each audit log contains the following information:


Example output for the Kubernetes API server:

Viewing the audit logs
You can view the logs for the OpenShift API server, Kubernetes API server, OpenShift OAuth API server, and OpenShift OAuth server for each control plane node.

To view the audit logs:

View the OpenShift API server audit logs:

Filtering audit logs
You can use jq or another JSON parsing tool to filter the API server audit logs.

The amount of information logged to the API server audit logs is controlled by the audit log policy that is set.
The following procedure provides examples of using jq to filter audit logs on control plane node node-1.example.com. See the jq Manual for detailed information on using jq.

You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

You have installed jq.


Filter OpenShift API server audit logs by user:

Filter OpenShift API server audit logs by user agent:

Filter Kubernetes API server audit logs by a certain API version and only output the user agent:

Filter OpenShift OAuth API server audit logs by excluding a verb:

Filter OpenShift OAuth server audit logs by events that identified a username and failed with an error:
Gathering audit logs
You can use the must-gather tool to collect the audit logs for debugging your cluster, which you can review or send to Red Hat Support.

Run the oc adm must-gather command with - /usr/bin/gather_audit_logs:

Create a compressed file from the must-gather directory that was just created in your working directory. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

Attach the compressed file to your support case on the the Customer Support page of the Red Hat Customer Portal.
