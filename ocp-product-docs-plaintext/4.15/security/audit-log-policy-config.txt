Configuring the audit log policy

You can control the amount of information that is logged to the API server audit logs by choosing the audit log policy profile to use.
About audit log policy profiles
Audit log profiles define how to log requests that come to the OpenShift API server, Kubernetes API server, OpenShift OAuth API server, and OpenShift OAuth server.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform provides the following predefined audit policy profiles:


Sensitive resources, such as Secret, Route, and OAuthClient objects, are only ever logged at the metadata level. OpenShift OAuth server events are only ever logged at the metadata level.
By default, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform uses the Default audit log profile. You can use another audit policy profile that also logs request bodies, but be aware of the increased resource usage (CPU, memory, and I/O).
Configuring the audit log policy
You can configure the audit log policy to use when logging requests that come to the API servers.

You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.


Edit the APIServer resource:

Update the spec.audit.profile field:

Save the file to apply the changes.


Verify that a new revision of the Kubernetes API server pods is rolled out. It can take several minutes for all nodes to update to the new revision.
Configuring the audit log policy with custom rules
You can configure an audit log policy that defines custom rules. You can specify multiple groups and define which profile to use for that group.

These custom rules take precedence over the top-level profile field. The custom rules are evaluated from top to bottom, and the first that matches is applied.

Custom rules are ignored if the top-level profile field is set to None.
You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.


Edit the APIServer resource:

Add the spec.audit.customRules field:

Save the file to apply the changes.


Verify that a new revision of the Kubernetes API server pods is rolled out. It can take several minutes for all nodes to update to the new revision.
Disabling audit logging
You can disable audit logging for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. When you disable audit logging, even OAuth access token requests and OAuth authorize token requests are not logged.

It is not recommended to disable audit logging by using the None profile unless you are fully aware of the risks of not logging data that can be beneficial when troubleshooting issues. If you disable audit logging and a support situation arises, you might need to enable audit logging and reproduce the issue in order to troubleshoot properly.
You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.


Edit the APIServer resource:

Set the spec.audit.profile field to None:
