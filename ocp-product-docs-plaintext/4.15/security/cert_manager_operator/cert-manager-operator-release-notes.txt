For more information, see Configuring certificates with an issuer.

With this release, the scope of the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift, which was previously limited to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on AMD64 architecture, has now been expanded to include support for managing certificates on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform running on IBM Z(R) (s390x), IBM Power(R) (ppc64le) and ARM64 architectures.

With this release, you can use DNS over HTTPS (DoH) for performing the self-checks during the ACME DNS-01 challenge verification. The DNS self-check method can be controlled by using the command line flags, --dns01-recursive-nameservers-only and --dns01-recursive-nameservers.
