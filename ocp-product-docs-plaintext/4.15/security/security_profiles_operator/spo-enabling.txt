# Installing the Security Profiles Operator

* You must have admin privileges.

1. In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, navigate to Operators -> OperatorHub.
2. Search for the Security Profiles Operator, then click Install.
3. Keep the default selection of Installation mode and namespace to ensure that the Operator will be installed to the openshift-security-profiles namespace.
4. Click Install.

To confirm that the installation is successful:

1. Navigate to the Operators -> Installed Operators page.
2. Check that the Security Profiles Operator is installed in the openshift-security-profiles namespace and its status is Succeeded.

If the Operator is not installed successfully:

1. Navigate to the Operators -> Installed Operators page and inspect the Status column for any errors or failures.
2. Navigate to the Workloads -> Pods page and check the logs in any pods in the openshift-security-profiles project that are reporting issues.

# Installing the Security Profiles Operator using the CLI

* You must have admin privileges.

1. Define a Namespace object:
Example namespace-object.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
    name: openshift-security-profiles
labels:
  openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"
```

2. Create the Namespace object:

```terminal
$ oc create -f namespace-object.yaml
```

3. Define an OperatorGroup object:
Example operator-group-object.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: security-profiles-operator
  namespace: openshift-security-profiles
```

4. Create the OperatorGroup object:

```terminal
$ oc create -f operator-group-object.yaml
```

5. Define a Subscription object:
Example subscription-object.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: security-profiles-operator-sub
  namespace: openshift-security-profiles
spec:
  channel: release-alpha-rhel-8
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
  name: security-profiles-operator
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
```

6. Create the Subscription object:

```terminal
$ oc create -f subscription-object.yaml
```



[NOTE]
----
If you are setting the global scheduler feature and enable defaultNodeSelector, you must create the namespace manually and update the annotations of the openshift-security-profiles namespace, or the namespace where the Security Profiles Operator was installed, with openshift.io/node-selector: “”. This removes the default node selector and prevents deployment failures.
----

1. Verify the installation succeeded by inspecting the following CSV file:

```terminal
$ oc get csv -n openshift-security-profiles
```

2. Verify that the Security Profiles Operator is operational by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get deploy -n openshift-security-profiles
```


# Configuring logging verbosity

The Security Profiles Operator supports the default logging verbosity of 0 and an enhanced verbosity of 1.

* To enable enhanced logging verbosity, patch the spod configuration and adjust the value by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-security-profiles patch spod \
    spod --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"verbosity":1}}'
```

Example output

```terminal
securityprofilesoperatordaemon.security-profiles-operator.x-k8s.io/spod patched
```
