Scanning pods for vulnerabilities

Using the Red Hat Quay Container Security Operator, you can access vulnerability scan results from the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" web console for container images used in active pods on the cluster. The Red Hat Quay Container Security Operator:

Watches containers associated with pods on all or specified namespaces

Queries the container registry where the containers came from for
vulnerability information, provided an image's registry is running image
scanning (such as
Quay.io or a
Red Hat Quay registry with Clair scanning)

Exposes vulnerabilities via the ImageManifestVuln object in the Kubernetes API


Using the instructions here, the Red Hat Quay Container Security Operator is installed in the openshift-operators namespace, so it is available to all namespaces on your "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster.
Installing the Red Hat Quay Container Security Operator
You can install the Red Hat Quay Container Security Operator from the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" web console Operator Hub, or by using the CLI.

You have installed the oc CLI.

You have administrator privileges to the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster.

You have containers that come from a Red Hat Quay or Quay.io registry running on your cluster.


You can install the Red Hat Quay Container Security Operator by using the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" web console:

Alternatively, you can install the Red Hat Quay Container Security Operator by using the CLI:
Using the Red Hat Quay Container Security Operator
The following procedure shows you how to use the Red Hat Quay Container Security Operator.

You have installed the Red Hat Quay Container Security Operator.


On the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" web console, navigate to Home -> Overview. Under the Status section, Quay Image Security provides the number of vulnerabilities found.

Click Quay Image Security to reveal the Quay Image Security breakdown, which details the severity of the vulnerabilities, whether the vulnerabilities can be fixed, and the total number of vulnerabilities. For example:

You can address detected vulnerabilities in one of two ways:

After you have learned what images are vulnerable, how to fix those vulnerabilities, and the namespaces that the images are being run in, you can improve security by performing the following actions:
Querying image vulnerabilities from the CLI
Using the oc command, you can display information about vulnerabilities detected by the Red Hat Quay Container Security Operator.

You have installed the Red Hat Quay Container Security Operator on your "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" instance.


Enter the following command to query for detected container image vulnerabilities:

To display details for a particular vulnerability, append the vulnerability name and its namespace to the oc describe command. The following example shows an active container whose image includes an RPM package with a vulnerability:
