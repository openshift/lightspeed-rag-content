Creating a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines on GCP

To create a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) cluster with multi-architecture compute machines, you must first create a single-architecture GCP installer-provisioned cluster with the multi-architecture installer binary. For more information on AWS installations, refer to Installing a cluster on GCP with customizations. You can then add ARM64 compute machines sets to your GCP cluster.

Secure booting is currently not supported on ARM64 machines for GCP
Verifying cluster compatibility
Before you can start adding compute nodes of different architectures to your cluster, you must verify that your cluster is multi-architecture compatible.

You installed the OpenShift CLI (oc)


You can check that your cluster uses the architecture payload by running the following command:


If you see the following output, then your cluster is using the multi-architecture payload:

If you see the following output, then your cluster is not using the multi-architecture payload:
Adding an ARM64 compute machine set to your GCP cluster
To configure a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines, you must create a GCP ARM64 compute machine set. This adds ARM64 compute nodes to your cluster.

You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

You used the installation program to create an AMD64 single-architecture AWS cluster with the multi-architecture installer binary.


Create and modify a compute machine set, this controls the ARM64 compute nodes in your cluster:


View the list of compute machine sets by entering the following command:

You can check that the nodes are ready and scheduable with the following command:
