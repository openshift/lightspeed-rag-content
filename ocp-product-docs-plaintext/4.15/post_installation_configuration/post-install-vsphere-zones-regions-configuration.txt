Multiple regions and zones configuration for a cluster on vSphere

As an administrator, you can specify multiple regions and zones for your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster that runs on a VMware vSphere instance. This configuration reduces the risk of a hardware failure or network outage causing your cluster to fail.

A failure domain configuration lists parameters that create a topology. The following list states some of these parameters:

computeCluster

datacenter

datastore

networks

resourcePool


After you define multiple regions and zones for your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, you can create or migrate nodes to another failure domain.

If you want to migrate pre-existing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster compute nodes to a failure domain, you must define a new compute machine set for the compute node. This new machine set can scale up a compute node according to the topology of the failure domain, and scale down the pre-existing compute node.

The cloud provider adds topology.kubernetes.io/zone and topology.kubernetes.io/region labels to any compute node provisioned by a machine set resource.

For more information, see Creating a compute machine set.
Specifying multiple regions and zones for your cluster on vSphere
You can configure the infrastructures.config.openshift.io configuration resource to specify multiple regions and zones for your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster that runs on a VMware vSphere instance.

Topology-aware features for the cloud controller manager and the vSphere Container Storage Interface (CSI) Operator Driver require information about the vSphere topology where you host your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. This topology information exists in the infrastructures.config.openshift.io configuration resource.

Before you specify regions and zones for your cluster, you must ensure that all datacenters and compute clusters contain tags, so that the cloud provider can add labels to your node. For example, if datacenter-1 represents region-a and compute-cluster-1 represents zone-1, the cloud provider adds an openshift-region category label with a value of region-a to datacenter-1.  Additionally, the cloud provider adds an openshift-zone category tag with a value of zone-1 to compute-cluster-1.

You can migrate control plane nodes with vMotion capabilities to a failure domain. After you add these nodes to a failure domain, the cloud provider adds topology.kubernetes.io/zone and topology.kubernetes.io/region labels to these nodes.
You created the openshift-region and openshift-zone tag categories on the vCenter server.

You ensured that each datacenter and compute cluster contains tags that represent the name of their associated region or zone, or both.

Optional: If you defined API and Ingress static IP addresses to the installation program, you must ensure that all regions and zones share a common layer 2 network. This configuration ensures that API and Ingress Virtual IP (VIP) addresses can interact with your cluster.


If you do not supply tags to all datacenters and compute clusters before you create a node or migrate a node, the cloud provider cannot add the topology.kubernetes.io/zone and topology.kubernetes.io/region labels to the node. This means that services cannot route traffic to your node.
Edit the infrastructures.config.openshift.io custom resource definition (CRD) of your cluster to specify multiple regions and zones in the failureDomains section of the resource by running the following command:

Save the resource file to apply the changes.


Parameters for the cluster-wide infrastructure CRD
Enabling a multiple layer 2 network for your cluster
You can configure your cluster to use a multiple layer 2 network configuration so that data transfer among nodes can span across multiple networks.

You configured network connectivity among machines so that cluster components can communicate with each other.


If you installed your cluster with installer-provisioned infrastructure, you must ensure that all control plane nodes share a common layer 2 network. Additionally, ensure compute nodes that are configured for Ingress pod scheduling share a common layer 2 network.

If you installed your cluster on infrastructure that you provided, which is defined as a user-provisioned infrastructure, complete the following actions to meet your needs:


Network connectivity requirements

Creating a compute machine set
Parameters for the cluster-wide infrastructure CRD
You must set values for specific parameters in the cluster-wide infrastructure, infrastructures.config.openshift.io, Custom Resource Definition (CRD) to define multiple regions and zones for your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster that runs on a VMware vSphere instance.

The following table lists mandatory parameters for defining multiple regions and zones for your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster:
