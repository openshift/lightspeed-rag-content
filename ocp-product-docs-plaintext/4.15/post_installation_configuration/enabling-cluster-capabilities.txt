# Enabling cluster capabilities


Cluster administrators can enable cluster capabilities that were disabled prior to installation.

[NOTE]
----
Cluster administrators cannot disable a cluster capability after it is enabled.
----

# Viewing the cluster capabilities

As a cluster administrator, you can view the capabilities by using the clusterversion resource status.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

* To view the status of the cluster capabilities, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get clusterversion version -o jsonpath='{.spec.capabilities}{"\n"}{.status.capabilities}{"\n"}'
```

Example output

```terminal
{"additionalEnabledCapabilities":["openshift-samples"],"baselineCapabilitySet":"None"}
{"enabledCapabilities":["openshift-samples"],"knownCapabilities":["CSISnapshot","Console","Insights","Storage","baremetal","marketplace","openshift-samples"]}
```


# Enabling the cluster capabilities by setting baseline capability set

As a cluster administrator, you can enable the capabilities by setting baselineCapabilitySet.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

* To set the baselineCapabilitySet, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc patch clusterversion version --type merge -p '{"spec":{"capabilities":{"baselineCapabilitySet":"vCurrent"}}}' 1
```

For baselineCapabilitySet you can specify vCurrent, v4.15, or None.

The following table describes the baselineCapabilitySet values.



# Enabling the cluster capabilities by setting additional enabled capabilities

As a cluster administrator, you can enable the cluster capabilities by setting additionalEnabledCapabilities.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. View the additional enabled capabilities by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get clusterversion version -o jsonpath='{.spec.capabilities.additionalEnabledCapabilities}{"\n"}'
```

Example output

```terminal
["openshift-samples"]
```

2. To set the additionalEnabledCapabilities, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc patch clusterversion/version --type merge -p '{"spec":{"capabilities":{"additionalEnabledCapabilities":["openshift-samples", "marketplace"]}}}'
```



[IMPORTANT]
----
It is not possible to disable a capability which is already enabled in a cluster. The cluster version Operator (CVO) continues to reconcile the capability which is already enabled in the cluster.
----

If you try to disable a capability, then CVO shows the divergent spec:


```terminal
$ oc get clusterversion version -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="ImplicitlyEnabledCapabilities")]}{"\n"}'
```



```terminal
{"lastTransitionTime":"2022-07-22T03:14:35Z","message":"The following capabilities could not be disabled: openshift-samples","reason":"CapabilitiesImplicitlyEnabled","status":"True","type":"ImplicitlyEnabledCapabilities"}
```



[NOTE]
----
During the cluster upgrades, it is possible that a given capability could be implicitly enabled. If a resource was already running on the cluster before the upgrade, then any capabilities that is part of the resource will be enabled. For example, during a cluster upgrade, a resource that is already running on the cluster has been changed to be part of the marketplace capability by the system. Even if a cluster administrator does not explicitly enabled the marketplace capability, it is implicitly enabled by the system.
