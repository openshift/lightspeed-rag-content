# Postinstallation machine configuration tasks


There are times when you need to make changes to the operating systems running on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform nodes. This can include changing settings for network time service, adding kernel arguments, or configuring journaling in a specific way.
Aside from a few specialized features, most changes to operating systems on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform nodes can be done by creating what are referred to as MachineConfig objects that are managed by the Machine Config Operator.
Tasks in this section describe how to use features of the Machine Config Operator to configure operating system features on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform nodes.

[IMPORTANT]
----
NetworkManager stores new network configurations to /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/ in a key file format.
Previously, NetworkManager stored new network configurations to /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ in the ifcfg format. Starting with RHEL 9.0, RHEL stores new network configurations at /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/ in a key file format. The connections configurations stored to /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ in the old format still work uninterrupted. Modifications in existing profiles continue updating the older files.

# About the Machine Config Operator

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15 integrates both
operating system and cluster management. Because the cluster manages its own
updates, including updates to Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) on cluster nodes,
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform provides an opinionated lifecycle management
experience that simplifies the orchestration of node upgrades.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform employs three daemon sets and controllers to
simplify node management. These daemon sets orchestrate operating system updates
and configuration changes to the hosts by using standard Kubernetes-style
constructs. They include:

* The machine-config-controller, which coordinates machine upgrades from the control
plane. It monitors all of the cluster nodes and orchestrates their configuration
updates.
* The machine-config-daemon daemon set, which runs on
each node in the cluster and updates a machine to configuration as defined by
machine config and as instructed by the MachineConfigController. When the node detects
a change, it drains off its pods, applies the update, and reboots. These changes
come in the form of Ignition configuration files that apply the specified
machine configuration and control kubelet configuration. The update itself is
delivered in a container. This process is key to the success of managing
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and RHCOS updates together.
* The machine-config-server daemon set, which provides the Ignition config files
to control plane nodes as they join the cluster.

The machine configuration is a subset of the Ignition configuration. The
machine-config-daemon reads the machine configuration to see if it needs to do
an OSTree update or if it must apply a series of systemd kubelet file changes,
configuration changes, or other changes to the operating system or Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
configuration.

When you perform node management operations, you create or modify a
KubeletConfig custom resource (CR).


[IMPORTANT]
----
When changes are made to a machine configuration, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) automatically reboots all corresponding nodes in order for the changes to take effect.
To prevent the nodes from automatically rebooting after machine configuration changes, before making the changes, you must pause the autoreboot process by setting the spec.paused field to true in the corresponding machine config pool. When paused, machine configuration changes are not applied until you set the spec.paused field to false and the nodes have rebooted into the new configuration.
The following modifications do not trigger a node reboot:
* When the MCO detects any of the following changes, it applies the update without draining or rebooting the node:
* Changes to the SSH key in the spec.config.passwd.users.sshAuthorizedKeys parameter of a machine config.
* Changes to the global pull secret or pull secret in the openshift-config namespace.
* Automatic rotation of the /etc/kubernetes/kubelet-ca.crt certificate authority (CA) by the Kubernetes API Server Operator.
* When the MCO detects changes to the /etc/containers/registries.conf file, such as adding or editing an ImageDigestMirrorSet, ImageTagMirrorSet, or ImageContentSourcePolicy object, it drains the corresponding nodes, applies the changes, and uncordons the nodes. The node drain does not happen for the following changes:
* The addition of a registry with the pull-from-mirror = "digest-only" parameter set for each mirror.
* The addition of a mirror with the pull-from-mirror = "digest-only" parameter set in a registry.
* The addition of items to the unqualified-search-registries list.
----

There might be situations where the configuration on a node does not fully match what the currently-applied machine config specifies. This state is called configuration drift. The Machine Config Daemon (MCD) regularly checks the nodes for configuration drift. If the MCD detects configuration drift, the MCO marks the node degraded until an administrator corrects the node configuration. A degraded node is online and operational, but, it cannot be updated.

## Understanding the Machine Config Operator node drain behavior

When you use a machine config to change a system feature, such as adding new config files, modifying systemd units or kernel arguments, or updating SSH keys, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) applies those changes and ensures that each node is in the desired configuration state.

After you make the changes, the MCO generates a new rendered machine config. In the majority of cases, when applying the new rendered machine config, the Operator performs the following steps on each affected node until all of the affected nodes have the updated configuration:

1. Cordon. The MCO marks the node as not schedulable for additional workloads.
2. Drain. The MCO terminates all running workloads on the node, causing the workloads to be rescheduled onto other nodes.
3. Apply. The MCO writes the new configuration to the nodes as needed.
4. Reboot. The MCO restarts the node.
5. Uncordon. The MCO marks the node as schedulable for workloads.

Throughout this process, the MCO maintains the required number of pods based on the MaxUnavailable value set in the machine config pool.


[NOTE]
----
There are conditions which can prevent the MCO from draining a node. If the MCO fails to drain a node, the Operator will be unable to reboot the node, preventing any changes made to the node through a machine config. For more information and mitigation steps, see the MCCDrainError runbook.
----

If the MCO drains pods on the master node, note the following conditions:

* In single-node OpenShift clusters, the MCO skips the drain operation.
* The MCO does not drain static pods in order to prevent interference with services, such as etcd.


[NOTE]
----
In certain cases the nodes are not drained. For more information, see "About the Machine Config Operator."
----

You can mitigate the disruption caused by drain and reboot cycles by disabling control plane reboots. For more information, see "Disabling the Machine Config Operator from automatically rebooting."

* Disabling Machine Config Operator from automatically rebooting.

## Understanding configuration drift detection

There might be situations when the on-disk state of a node differs from what is configured in the machine config. This is known as configuration drift. For example, a cluster admin might manually modify a file, a systemd unit file, or a file permission that was configured through a machine config. This causes configuration drift. Configuration drift can cause problems between nodes in a Machine Config Pool or when the machine configs are updated.

The Machine Config Operator (MCO) uses the Machine Config Daemon (MCD) to check nodes for configuration drift on a regular basis. If detected, the MCO sets the node and the machine config pool (MCP) to Degraded and reports the error. A degraded node is online and operational, but, it cannot be updated.

The MCD performs configuration drift detection upon each of the following conditions:

* When a node boots.
* After any of the files (Ignition files and systemd drop-in units) specified in the machine config are modified outside of the machine config.
* Before a new machine config is applied.

[NOTE]
----
If you apply a new machine config to the nodes, the MCD temporarily shuts down configuration drift detection. This shutdown is needed because the new machine config necessarily differs from the machine config on the nodes. After the new machine config is applied, the MCD restarts detecting configuration drift using the new machine config.
----

When performing configuration drift detection, the MCD validates that the file contents and permissions fully match what the currently-applied machine config specifies. Typically, the MCD detects configuration drift in less than a second after the detection is triggered.

If the MCD detects configuration drift, the MCD performs the following tasks:

* Emits an error to the console logs
* Emits a Kubernetes event
* Stops further detection on the node
* Sets the node and MCP to degraded

You can check if you have a degraded node by listing the MCPs:


```terminal
$ oc get mcp worker
```


If you have a degraded MCP, the DEGRADEDMACHINECOUNT field is non-zero, similar to the following output:


```terminal
NAME     CONFIG                                             UPDATED   UPDATING   DEGRADED   MACHINECOUNT   READYMACHINECOUNT   UPDATEDMACHINECOUNT   DEGRADEDMACHINECOUNT   AGE

```


You can determine if the problem is caused by configuration drift by examining the machine config pool:


```terminal
$ oc describe mcp worker
```



```terminal

This message shows that a node's /etc/mco-test-file file, which was added by the machine config, has changed outside of the machine config.
The state of the node is NodeDegraded.

Or, if you know which node is degraded, examine that node:

The error message indicating that configuration drift was detected between the node and the listed machine config. Here the error message indicates that the contents of the /etc/mco-test-file, which was added by the machine config, has changed outside of the machine config.
The state of the node is Degraded.

You can correct configuration drift and return the node to the Ready state by performing one of the following remediations:

* Ensure that the contents and file permissions of the files on the node match what is configured in the machine config. You can manually rewrite the file
contents or change the file permissions.
* Generate a force file on the degraded node. The force file causes the MCD to bypass the usual configuration drift detection and reapplies the current machine config.

[NOTE]
----
Generating a force file on a node causes that node to reboot.

## Checking machine config pool status

To see the status of the Machine Config Operator (MCO), its sub-components, and the resources it manages, use the following oc commands:

1. To see the number of MCO-managed nodes available on your cluster for each machine config pool (MCP), run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get machineconfigpool
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME      CONFIG                    UPDATED  UPDATING   DEGRADED  MACHINECOUNT  READYMACHINECOUNT  UPDATEDMACHINECOUNT DEGRADEDMACHINECOUNT  AGE
master    rendered-master-06c9c4…   True     False      False     3             3                  3                   0                     4h42m
worker    rendered-worker-f4b64…    False    True       False     3             2                  2                   0                     4h42m
```

where:
UPDATED:: The True status indicates that the MCO has applied the current machine config to the nodes in that MCP. The current machine config is specified in the STATUS field in the oc get mcp output. The False status indicates a node in the MCP is updating.
UPDATING:: The True status indicates that the MCO is applying the desired machine config, as specified in the MachineConfigPool custom resource, to at least one of the nodes in that MCP. The desired machine config is the new, edited machine config. Nodes that are updating might not be available for scheduling. The False status indicates that all nodes in the MCP are updated.
DEGRADED:: A True status indicates the MCO is blocked from applying the current or desired machine config to at least one of the nodes in that MCP, or the configuration is failing. Nodes that are degraded might not be available for scheduling. A False status indicates that all nodes in the MCP are ready.
MACHINECOUNT:: Indicates the total number of machines in that MCP.
READYMACHINECOUNT:: Indicates the total number of machines in that MCP that are ready for scheduling.
UPDATEDMACHINECOUNT:: Indicates the total number of machines in that MCP that have the current machine config.
DEGRADEDMACHINECOUNT:: Indicates the total number of machines in that MCP that are marked as degraded or unreconcilable.

In the previous output, there are three control plane (master) nodes and three worker nodes. The control plane MCP and the associated nodes are updated to the current machine config. The nodes in the worker MCP are being updated to the desired machine config. Two of the nodes in the worker MCP are updated and one is still updating, as indicated by the UPDATEDMACHINECOUNT being 2. There are no issues, as indicated by the DEGRADEDMACHINECOUNT being 0 and DEGRADED being False.

While the nodes in the MCP are updating, the machine config listed under CONFIG is the current machine config, which the MCP is being updated from. When the update is complete, the listed machine config is the desired machine config, which the MCP was updated to.

[NOTE]
----
If a node is being cordoned, that node is not included in the READYMACHINECOUNT, but is included in the MACHINECOUNT. Also, the MCP status is set to UPDATING. Because the node has the current machine config, it is counted in the UPDATEDMACHINECOUNT total:

```terminal
NAME      CONFIG                    UPDATED  UPDATING   DEGRADED  MACHINECOUNT  READYMACHINECOUNT  UPDATEDMACHINECOUNT DEGRADEDMACHINECOUNT  AGE
master    rendered-master-06c9c4…   True     False      False     3             3                  3                   0                     4h42m
worker    rendered-worker-c1b41a…   False    True       False     3             2                  3                   0                     4h42m
```

----
2. To check the status of the nodes in an MCP by examining the MachineConfigPool custom resource, run the following command:
:

```terminal
$ oc describe mcp worker
```

Example output

```terminal
...

  Unavailable Machine Count:  0
  Updated Machine Count:      3
Events:                       <none>
```


[NOTE]
----
If a node is being cordoned, the node is not included in the Ready Machine Count. It is included in the Unavailable Machine Count:

```terminal
...
  Degraded Machine Count:     0
  Machine Count:              3
  Observed Generation:        2

  Unavailable Machine Count:  1
  Updated Machine Count:      3
```

----
3. To see each existing MachineConfig object, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get machineconfigs
```

Example output

```terminal

```


Note that the MachineConfig objects listed as rendered are not meant to be changed or deleted.
4. To view the contents of a particular machine config (in this case, 01-master-kubelet), run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc describe machineconfigs 01-master-kubelet
```


The output from the command shows that this MachineConfig object contains both configuration files (cloud.conf and kubelet.conf) and a systemd service (Kubernetes Kubelet):
Example output

```terminal

```


If something goes wrong with a machine config that you apply, you can always back out that change. For example, if you had run oc create -f ./myconfig.yaml to apply a machine config, you could remove that machine config by running the following command:


```terminal
$ oc delete -f ./myconfig.yaml
```


If that was the only problem, the nodes in the affected pool should return to a non-degraded state. This actually causes the rendered configuration to roll back to its previously rendered state.

If you add your own machine configs to your cluster, you can use the commands shown in the previous example to check their status and the related status of the pool to which they are applied.

## Checking machine config node status

During updates you might want to monitor the progress of individual nodes in case issues arise and you need to troubleshoot a node.

To see the status of the Machine Config Operator (MCO) updates to your cluster, use the following oc commands:

1. Get a summary of update statuses for all nodes in all machine config pools by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get machineconfignodes
```

Example output

```


where:
UPDATED:: The True status indicates that the MCO has applied the current machine config to that particular node. The False status indicates that the node is currently updating. The Unknown status means the operation is processing.
UPDATEPREPARED:: The False status indicates that the MCO has not started reconciling the new machine configs to be distributed. The True status indicates that the MCO has completed this phase of the update. The Unknown status means the operation is processing.
UPDATEEXECUTED:: The False status indicates that the MCO has not started cordoning and draining the node. It also indicates that the disk state and operating system have not started updating. The True status indicates that the MCO has completed this phase of the update. The Unknown status means the operation is processing.
UPDATEPOSTACTIONCOMPLETED:: The False status indicates that the MCO has not started rebooting the node or closing the daemon. The True status indicates that the MCO has completed reboot and updating the node status. The Unknown status indicates either that an error has occurred during the update process at this phase, or that the MCO is currently applying the update.
UPDATECOMPLETED:: The False status indicates that the MCO has not started uncordoning the node and updating the node state and metrics. The True status indicates that the MCO has finished updating the node state and available metrics.
RESUMED:: The False status indicates that the MCO has not started the config drift monitor. The True status indicates that the node has resumed operation. The Unknown status means the operation is processing.

[NOTE]
----
Within the primary phases previously described, you can have secondary phases which you can use to see the update progression in more detail. You can get more information that includes secondary phases of updates by using the -o wide option of the preceding command. This provides the additional UPDATECOMPATIBLE, UPDATEFILESANDOS, DRAINEDNODE, CORDONEDNODE, REBOOTNODE, RELOADEDCRIO and UNCORDONED columns. These secondary phases do not always occur and depend on the type of update you want to apply.
----
2. Check the update status of nodes in a specific machine config pool by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get machineconfignodes $(oc get machineconfignodes -o json | jq -r '.items[]|select(.spec.pool.name=="<pool_name>")|.metadata.name') 1
```

The name of the pool is the MachineConfigPool object name.
Example output

```text

```

3. Check the update status of an individual node by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc describe machineconfignode/<node_name> 1
```

The name of the node is the MachineConfigNode object name.

The desired configuration specified in the spec.configversion.desired field updates immediately when a new configuration is detected on the node.
The desired configuration specified in the status.configversion.desired field updates only when the new configuration is validated by the Machine Config Daemon (MCD). The MCD performs validation by checking the current phase of the update. If the update successfully passes the UPDATEPREPARED phase, then the status adds the new configuration.

## Viewing and interacting with certificates

The following certificates are handled in the cluster by the Machine Config Controller (MCC) and can be found in the ControllerConfig resource:

* /etc/kubernetes/kubelet-ca.crt
* /etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/configmaps/cloud-config/ca-bundle.pem
* /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/openshift-config-user-ca-bundle.crt

The MCC also handles the image registry certificates and its associated user bundle certificate.

You can get information about the listed certificates, including the underyling bundle the certificate comes from, and the signing and subject data.

* This procedure contains optional steps that require that the python-yq RPM package is installed.

* Get detailed certificate information by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get controllerconfig/machine-config-controller -o yaml | yq -y '.status.controllerCertificates'
```

Example output

```yaml
- bundleFile: KubeAPIServerServingCAData
  notAfter: '2034-10-23T13:13:02Z'
  notBefore: '2024-10-25T13:13:02Z'
  signer: CN=admin-kubeconfig-signer,OU=openshift
  subject: CN=admin-kubeconfig-signer,OU=openshift

```

* Get a simpler version of the information found in the ControllerConfig resource by checking the machine config pool status using the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get mcp master -o yaml | yq -y '.status.certExpirys'
```

Example output

```yaml

This method is meant for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform applications that already consume machine config pool information.
* Check which image registry certificates are on the nodes:
1. Log in to a node:

```terminal
$ oc debug node/<node_name>
```

2. Set /host as the root directory within the debug shell:

```terminal
sh-5.1# chroot /host
```

3. Look at the contents of the /etc/docker/cert.d directory:

```terminal
sh-5.1# ls /etc/docker/certs.d
```

Example output

```terminal
image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc.cluster.local:5000
image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000
```


# Using MachineConfig objects to configure nodes

You can use the tasks in this section to create MachineConfig objects that modify files, systemd unit files, and other operating system features running on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform nodes. For more ideas on working with machine configs, see content related to updating SSH authorized keys, verifying image signatures, enabling SCTP, and configuring iSCSI initiatornames for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform supports Ignition specification version 3.2. All new machine configs you create going forward should be based on Ignition specification version 3.2. If you are upgrading your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, any existing Ignition specification version 2.x machine configs will be translated automatically to specification version 3.2.

There might be situations where the configuration on a node does not fully match what the currently-applied machine config specifies. This state is called configuration drift. The Machine Config Daemon (MCD) regularly checks the nodes for configuration drift. If the MCD detects configuration drift, the MCO marks the node degraded until an administrator corrects the node configuration. A degraded node is online and operational, but, it cannot be updated. For more information on configuration drift, see Understanding configuration drift detection.


[TIP]
----
Use the following "Configuring chrony time service" procedure as a model for how to go about adding other configuration files to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform nodes.
----

## Configuring chrony time service

You
can
set the time server and related settings used by the chrony time service (chronyd)
by modifying the contents of the chrony.conf file and passing those contents
to your nodes as a machine config.

1. Create a Butane config including the contents of the chrony.conf file. For example, to configure chrony on worker nodes, create a 99-worker-chrony.bu file.

[NOTE]
----
See "Creating machine configs with Butane" for information about Butane.
----

```yaml
variant: openshift
version: 4.15.0
metadata:
  name: 99-worker-chrony 1
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker 1
storage:
  files:
  - path: /etc/chrony.conf
    mode: 0644 2
    overwrite: true
    contents:
      inline: |
        pool 0.rhel.pool.ntp.org iburst 3
        driftfile /var/lib/chrony/drift
        makestep 1.0 3
        rtcsync
        logdir /var/log/chrony
```

On control plane nodes, substitute master for worker in both of these locations.
Specify an octal value mode for the mode field in the machine config file. After creating the file and applying the changes, the mode is converted to a decimal value. You can check the YAML file with the command oc get mc <mc-name> -o yaml.
Specify any valid, reachable time source, such as the one provided by your DHCP server.
Alternately, you can specify any of the following NTP servers: 1.rhel.pool.ntp.org, 2.rhel.pool.ntp.org, or 3.rhel.pool.ntp.org.
2. Use Butane to generate a MachineConfig object file, 99-worker-chrony.yaml, containing the configuration to be delivered to the nodes:

```terminal
$ butane 99-worker-chrony.bu -o 99-worker-chrony.yaml
```

3. Apply the configurations in one of two ways:
* If the cluster is not running yet, after you generate manifest files, add the MachineConfig object file to the <installation_directory>/openshift directory, and then continue to create the cluster.
* If the cluster is already running, apply the file:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f ./99-worker-chrony.yaml
```


* Creating machine configs with Butane

## Disabling the chrony time service

You can disable the chrony time service (chronyd) for nodes with a specific role by using a MachineConfig custom resource (CR).

* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

1. Create the MachineConfig CR that disables chronyd for the specified node role.
1. Save the following YAML in the disable-chronyd.yaml file:

```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: <node_role> 1
  name: disable-chronyd
spec:
  config:
    ignition:
      version: 3.2.0
    systemd:
      units:
        - contents: |
            [Unit]
            Description=NTP client/server
            Documentation=man:chronyd(8) man:chrony.conf(5)
            After=ntpdate.service sntp.service ntpd.service
            Conflicts=ntpd.service systemd-timesyncd.service
            ConditionCapability=CAP_SYS_TIME
            [Service]
            Type=forking
            PIDFile=/run/chrony/chronyd.pid
            EnvironmentFile=-/etc/sysconfig/chronyd
            ExecStart=/usr/sbin/chronyd $OPTIONS
            ExecStartPost=/usr/libexec/chrony-helper update-daemon
            PrivateTmp=yes
            ProtectHome=yes
            ProtectSystem=full
            [Install]
            WantedBy=multi-user.target
          enabled: false
          name: "chronyd.service"
```

Node role where you want to disable chronyd, for example, master.
2. Create the MachineConfig CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f disable-chronyd.yaml
```


## Adding kernel arguments to nodes

In some special cases, you might want to add kernel arguments to a set of nodes in your cluster. This should only be done with caution and clear understanding of the implications of the arguments you set.


[WARNING]
----
Improper use of kernel arguments can result in your systems becoming unbootable.
----

Examples of kernel arguments you could set include:

* nosmt: Disables symmetric multithreading (SMT) in the kernel. Multithreading allows multiple logical threads for each CPU. You could consider nosmt in multi-tenant environments to reduce risks from potential cross-thread attacks. By disabling SMT, you essentially choose security over performance.
* systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy: Enables Linux control group version 2 (cgroup v2). cgroup v2 is the next version of the kernel control group and offers multiple improvements.
* enforcing=0: Configures Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux) to run in permissive mode. In permissive mode, the system acts as if SELinux is enforcing the loaded security policy, including labeling objects and emitting access denial entries in the logs, but it does not actually deny any operations. While not supported for production systems, permissive mode can be helpful for debugging.

[WARNING]
----
Disabling SELinux on RHCOS in production is not supported.
Once SELinux has been disabled on a node, it must be re-provisioned before re-inclusion in a production cluster.
----

See Kernel.org kernel parameters for a list and descriptions of kernel arguments.

In the following procedure, you create a MachineConfig object that identifies:

* A set of machines to which you want to add the kernel argument. In this case, machines with a worker role.
* Kernel arguments that are appended to the end of the existing kernel arguments.
* A label that indicates where in the list of machine configs the change is applied.

* Have administrative privilege to a working Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

1. List existing MachineConfig objects for your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster to determine how to
label your machine config:

```terminal
$ oc get MachineConfig
```

Example output

```terminal

```

2. Create a MachineConfig object file that identifies the kernel argument (for example, 05-worker-kernelarg-selinuxpermissive.yaml)

```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker1
  name: 05-worker-kernelarg-selinuxpermissive2
spec:
  kernelArguments:
    - enforcing=03
```

Applies the new kernel argument only to worker nodes.
Named to identify where it fits among the machine configs (05) and what it does (adds
a kernel argument to configure SELinux permissive mode).
Identifies the exact kernel argument as enforcing=0.
3. Create the new machine config:

```terminal
$ oc create -f 05-worker-kernelarg-selinuxpermissive.yaml
```

4. Check the machine configs to see that the new one was added:

```terminal
$ oc get MachineConfig
```

Example output

```terminal

```

5. Check the nodes:

```terminal
$ oc get nodes
```

Example output

```terminal

ip-10-0-136-243.ec2.internal   Ready                      master   34m   v1.28.5
ip-10-0-141-105.ec2.internal   Ready,SchedulingDisabled   worker   28m   v1.28.5
ip-10-0-142-249.ec2.internal   Ready                      master   34m   v1.28.5
ip-10-0-153-11.ec2.internal    Ready                      worker   28m   v1.28.5
ip-10-0-153-150.ec2.internal   Ready                      master   34m   v1.28.5
```


You can see that scheduling on each worker node is disabled as the change is being applied.
6. Check that the kernel argument worked by going to one of the worker nodes and listing
the kernel command line arguments (in /proc/cmdline on the host):

```terminal
$ oc debug node/ip-10-0-141-105.ec2.internal
```

Example output

```terminal
Starting pod/ip-10-0-141-105ec2internal-debug ...
To use host binaries, run `chroot /host`

sh-4.2# cat /host/proc/cmdline
BOOT_IMAGE=/ostree/rhcos-... console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8
rootflags=defaults,prjquota rw root=UUID=fd0... ostree=/ostree/boot.0/rhcos/16...
coreos.oem.id=qemu coreos.oem.id=ec2 ignition.platform.id=ec2 enforcing=0

sh-4.2# exit
```


You should see the enforcing=0 argument added to the other kernel arguments.

## Enabling multipathing with kernel arguments on RHCOS

Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) supports multipathing on the primary disk, allowing stronger resilience to hardware failure to achieve higher host availability. Postinstallation support is available by activating multipathing via the machine config.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Enabling multipathing during installation is supported and recommended for nodes provisioned in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.8 or higher. In setups where any I/O to non-optimized paths results in I/O system errors, you must enable multipathing at installation time. For more information about enabling multipathing during installation time, see "Enabling multipathing with kernel arguments on RHCOS" in the Installing on bare metal documentation.
----


[IMPORTANT]
----
On IBM Z(R) and IBM(R) LinuxONE, you can enable multipathing only if you configured your cluster for it during installation. For more information, see "Installing RHCOS and starting the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform bootstrap process" in Installing a cluster with z/VM on IBM Z(R) and IBM(R) LinuxONE.
----


[IMPORTANT]
----
When a Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15 cluster is installed or configured as a post-installation activity on a single VIOS host with "vSCSI" storage on IBM Power(R) with multipath configured, the CoreOS nodes with multipath enabled fail to boot. This behavior is expected, as only one path is available to the Node.
----

* You have a running Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster that uses version 4.7 or later.
* You are logged in to the cluster as a user with administrative privileges.
* You have confirmed that the disk is enabled for multipathing. Multipathing is only supported on hosts that are connected to a SAN via an HBA adapter.

1. To enable multipathing postinstallation on control plane nodes:
* Create a machine config file, such as 99-master-kargs-mpath.yaml, that instructs the cluster to add the master label and that identifies the multipath kernel argument, for example:

```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: "master"
  name: 99-master-kargs-mpath
spec:
  kernelArguments:
    - 'rd.multipath=default'
    - 'root=/dev/disk/by-label/dm-mpath-root'
```

2. To enable multipathing postinstallation on worker nodes:
* Create a machine config file, such as 99-worker-kargs-mpath.yaml, that instructs the cluster to add the worker label and that identifies the multipath kernel argument, for example:

```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: "worker"
  name: 99-worker-kargs-mpath
spec:
  kernelArguments:
    - 'rd.multipath=default'
    - 'root=/dev/disk/by-label/dm-mpath-root'
```

3. Create the new machine config by using either the master or worker YAML file you previously created:

```terminal
$ oc create -f ./99-worker-kargs-mpath.yaml
```

4. Check the machine configs to see that the new one was added:

```terminal
$ oc get MachineConfig
```

Example output

```terminal

```

5. Check the nodes:

```terminal
$ oc get nodes
```

Example output

```terminal

ip-10-0-136-243.ec2.internal   Ready                      master   34m   v1.28.5
ip-10-0-141-105.ec2.internal   Ready,SchedulingDisabled   worker   28m   v1.28.5
ip-10-0-142-249.ec2.internal   Ready                      master   34m   v1.28.5
ip-10-0-153-11.ec2.internal    Ready                      worker   28m   v1.28.5
ip-10-0-153-150.ec2.internal   Ready                      master   34m   v1.28.5
```


You can see that scheduling on each worker node is disabled as the change is being applied.
6. Check that the kernel argument worked by going to one of the worker nodes and listing
the kernel command line arguments (in /proc/cmdline on the host):

```terminal
$ oc debug node/ip-10-0-141-105.ec2.internal
```

Example output

```terminal
Starting pod/ip-10-0-141-105ec2internal-debug ...
To use host binaries, run `chroot /host`

sh-4.2# cat /host/proc/cmdline
...
rd.multipath=default root=/dev/disk/by-label/dm-mpath-root
...

sh-4.2# exit
```


You should see the added kernel arguments.

* See Enabling multipathing with kernel arguments on RHCOS for more information about enabling multipathing during installation time.

## Adding a real-time kernel to nodes

Some Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform workloads require a high degree of determinism.While Linux is not a real-time operating system, the Linux real-time
kernel includes a preemptive scheduler that provides the operating system with real-time characteristics.

If your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform workloads require these real-time characteristics, you can switch your machines to the Linux real-time kernel. For Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, 4.15 you can make this switch using a MachineConfig object. Although making the change is as simple as changing a machine config kernelType setting to realtime, there are a few other considerations before making the change:

* Currently, real-time kernel is supported only on worker nodes, and only for radio access network (RAN) use.
* The following procedure is fully supported with bare metal installations that use systems that are certified for Red Hat Enterprise Linux for Real Time 8.
* Real-time support in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is limited to specific subscriptions.
* The following procedure is also supported for use with Google Cloud Platform.

* Have a running Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster (version 4.4 or later).
* Log in to the cluster as a user with administrative privileges.

1. Create a machine config for the real-time kernel: Create a YAML file (for example, 99-worker-realtime.yaml) that contains a MachineConfig
object for the realtime kernel type. This example tells the cluster to use a real-time kernel for all worker nodes:

```terminal
$ cat << EOF > 99-worker-realtime.yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: "worker"
  name: 99-worker-realtime
spec:
  kernelType: realtime
EOF
```

2. Add the machine config to the cluster. Type the following to add the machine config to the cluster:

```terminal
$ oc create -f 99-worker-realtime.yaml
```

3. Check the real-time kernel: Once each impacted node reboots, log in to the cluster and run the following commands to make sure that the real-time kernel has replaced the regular kernel for the set of nodes you configured:

```terminal
$ oc get nodes
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                                        STATUS  ROLES    AGE   VERSION
ip-10-0-143-147.us-east-2.compute.internal  Ready   worker   103m  v1.28.5
ip-10-0-146-92.us-east-2.compute.internal   Ready   worker   101m  v1.28.5
ip-10-0-169-2.us-east-2.compute.internal    Ready   worker   102m  v1.28.5
```


```terminal
$ oc debug node/ip-10-0-143-147.us-east-2.compute.internal
```

Example output

```terminal
Starting pod/ip-10-0-143-147us-east-2computeinternal-debug ...
To use host binaries, run `chroot /host`

sh-4.4# uname -a
Linux <worker_node> 4.18.0-147.3.1.rt24.96.el8_1.x86_64 #1 SMP PREEMPT RT
        Wed Nov 27 18:29:55 UTC 2019 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```


The kernel name contains rt and text “PREEMPT RT” indicates that this is a real-time kernel.
4. To go back to the regular kernel, delete the MachineConfig object:

```terminal
$ oc delete -f 99-worker-realtime.yaml
```


## Configuring journald settings

If you need to configure settings for the journald service on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform nodes, you can do that by modifying the appropriate configuration file and passing the file to the appropriate pool of nodes as a machine config.

This procedure describes how to modify journald rate limiting settings in the /etc/systemd/journald.conf file and apply them to worker nodes. See the journald.conf man page for information on how to use that file.

* Have a running Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* Log in to the cluster as a user with administrative privileges.

1. Create a Butane config file, 40-worker-custom-journald.bu, that includes an /etc/systemd/journald.conf file with the required settings.

[NOTE]
----
See "Creating machine configs with Butane" for information about Butane.
----

```yaml
variant: openshift
version: 4.15.0
metadata:
  name: 40-worker-custom-journald
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
storage:
  files:
  - path: /etc/systemd/journald.conf
    mode: 0644
    overwrite: true
    contents:
      inline: |
        # Disable rate limiting
        RateLimitInterval=1s
        RateLimitBurst=10000
        Storage=volatile
        Compress=no
        MaxRetentionSec=30s
```

2. Use Butane to generate a MachineConfig object file, 40-worker-custom-journald.yaml, containing the configuration to be delivered to the worker nodes:

```terminal
$ butane 40-worker-custom-journald.bu -o 40-worker-custom-journald.yaml
```

3. Apply the machine config to the pool:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f 40-worker-custom-journald.yaml
```

4. Check that the new machine config is applied and that the nodes are not in a degraded state. It might take a few minutes. The worker pool will show the updates in progress, as each node successfully has the new machine config applied:

```terminal
$ oc get machineconfigpool
NAME   CONFIG             UPDATED UPDATING DEGRADED MACHINECOUNT READYMACHINECOUNT UPDATEDMACHINECOUNT DEGRADEDMACHINECOUNT AGE
master rendered-master-35 True    False    False    3            3                 3                   0                    34m
worker rendered-worker-d8 False   True     False    3            1                 1                   0                    34m
```

5. To check that the change was applied, you can log in to a worker node:

```terminal
$ oc get node | grep worker
ip-10-0-0-1.us-east-2.compute.internal   Ready    worker   39m   v0.0.0-master+$Format:%h$
$ oc debug node/ip-10-0-0-1.us-east-2.compute.internal
Starting pod/ip-10-0-141-142us-east-2computeinternal-debug ...
...
sh-4.2# chroot /host
sh-4.4# cat /etc/systemd/journald.conf
# Disable rate limiting
RateLimitInterval=1s
RateLimitBurst=10000
Storage=volatile
Compress=no
MaxRetentionSec=30s
sh-4.4# exit
```

## Adding extensions to RHCOS

RHCOS is a minimal container-oriented RHEL operating system, designed to provide a common set of capabilities to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters across all platforms. While adding software packages to RHCOS systems is generally discouraged, the MCO provides an extensions feature you can use to add a minimal set of features to RHCOS nodes.

Currently, the following extensions are available:

* usbguard: Adding the usbguard extension protects RHCOS systems from attacks from intrusive USB devices. See USBGuard for details.
* kerberos: Adding the kerberos extension provides a mechanism that allows both users and machines to identify themselves to the network to receive defined, limited access to the areas and services that an administrator has configured. See Using Kerberos for details, including how to set up a Kerberos client and mount a Kerberized NFS share.

The following procedure describes how to use a machine config to add one or more extensions to your RHCOS nodes.

* Have a running Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster (version 4.6 or later).
* Log in to the cluster as a user with administrative privileges.

1. Create a machine config for extensions: Create a YAML file (for example, 80-extensions.yaml) that contains a MachineConfig extensions object. This example tells the cluster to add the usbguard extension.

```terminal
$ cat << EOF > 80-extensions.yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
  name: 80-worker-extensions
spec:
  config:
    ignition:
      version: 3.2.0
  extensions:
    - usbguard
EOF
```

2. Add the machine config to the cluster. Type the following to add the machine config to the cluster:

```terminal
$ oc create -f 80-extensions.yaml
```


This sets all worker nodes to have rpm packages for usbguard installed.
3. Check that the extensions were applied:

```terminal
$ oc get machineconfig 80-worker-extensions
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                 GENERATEDBYCONTROLLER IGNITIONVERSION AGE
80-worker-extensions                       3.2.0           57s
```

4. Check that the new machine config is now applied and that the nodes are not in a degraded state. It may take a few minutes. The worker pool will show the updates in progress, as each machine successfully has the new machine config applied:

```terminal
$ oc get machineconfigpool
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME   CONFIG             UPDATED UPDATING DEGRADED MACHINECOUNT READYMACHINECOUNT UPDATEDMACHINECOUNT DEGRADEDMACHINECOUNT AGE
master rendered-master-35 True    False    False    3            3                 3                   0                    34m
worker rendered-worker-d8 False   True     False    3            1                 1                   0                    34m
```

5. Check the extensions. To check that the extension was applied, run:

```terminal
$ oc get node | grep worker
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                                        STATUS  ROLES    AGE   VERSION
ip-10-0-169-2.us-east-2.compute.internal    Ready   worker   102m  v1.28.5
```


```terminal
$ oc debug node/ip-10-0-169-2.us-east-2.compute.internal
```

Example output

```terminal
...
To use host binaries, run `chroot /host`
sh-4.4# chroot /host
sh-4.4# rpm -q usbguard
usbguard-0.7.4-4.el8.x86_64.rpm
```


## Loading custom firmware blobs in the machine config manifest

Because the default location for firmware blobs in /usr/lib is read-only, you can locate a custom firmware blob by updating the search path. This enables you to load local firmware blobs in the machine config manifest when the blobs are not managed by RHCOS.

1. Create a Butane config file, 98-worker-firmware-blob.bu, that updates the search path so that it is root-owned and writable to local storage. The following example places the custom blob file from your local workstation onto nodes under /var/lib/firmware.

[NOTE]
----
See "Creating machine configs with Butane" for information about Butane.
----
Butane config file for custom firmware blob

```yaml
variant: openshift
version: 4.15.0
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
  name: 98-worker-firmware-blob
storage:
  files:
  - path: /var/lib/firmware/<package_name> 1
    contents:
      local: <package_name> 2
    mode: 0644 3
openshift:
  kernel_arguments:
    - 'firmware_class.path=/var/lib/firmware' 4
```

Sets the path on the node where the firmware package is copied to.
Specifies a file with contents that are read from a local file directory on the system running Butane. The path of the local file is relative to a files-dir directory, which must be specified by using the --files-dir option with Butane in the following step.
Sets the permissions for the file on the RHCOS node. It is recommended to set 0644 permissions.
The firmware_class.path parameter customizes the kernel search path of where to look for the custom firmware blob that was copied from your local workstation onto the root file system of the node. This example uses /var/lib/firmware as the customized path.
2. Run Butane to generate a MachineConfig object file that uses a copy of the firmware blob on your local workstation named 98-worker-firmware-blob.yaml. The firmware blob contains the configuration to be delivered to the nodes. The following example uses the --files-dir option to specify the directory on your workstation where the local file or files are located:

```terminal
$ butane 98-worker-firmware-blob.bu -o 98-worker-firmware-blob.yaml --files-dir <directory_including_package_name>
```

3. Apply the configurations to the nodes in one of two ways:
* If the cluster is not running yet, after you generate manifest files, add the MachineConfig object file to the <installation_directory>/openshift directory, and then continue to create the cluster.
* If the cluster is already running, apply the file:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f 98-worker-firmware-blob.yaml
```


A MachineConfig object YAML file is created for you to finish configuring your machines.
4. Save the Butane config in case you need to update the MachineConfig object in the future.

## Changing the core user password for node access

By default, Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) creates a user named core on the nodes in your cluster. You can use the core user to access the node through a cloud provider serial console or a bare metal baseboard controller manager (BMC). This can be helpful, for example, if a node is down and you cannot access that node by using SSH or the oc debug node command. However, by default, there is no password for this user, so you cannot log in without creating one.

You can create a password for the core user by using a machine config. The Machine Config Operator (MCO) assigns the password and injects the password into the /etc/shadow file, allowing you to log in with the core user. The MCO does not examine the password hash. As such, the MCO cannot report if there is a problem with the password.


[NOTE]
----
* The password works only through a cloud provider serial console or a BMC. It does not work with SSH.
* If you have a machine config that includes an /etc/shadow file or a systemd unit that sets a password, it takes precedence over the password hash.
----

You can change the password, if needed, by editing the machine config you used to create the password. Also, you can remove the password by deleting the machine config. Deleting the machine config does not remove the user account.

1. Using a tool that is supported by your operating system, create a hashed password. For example, create a hashed password using mkpasswd by running the following command:

```terminal
$ mkpasswd -m SHA-512 testpass
```

Example output

```terminal
$ $6$CBZwA6s6AVFOtiZe$aUKDWpthhJEyR3nnhM02NM1sKCpHn9XN.NPrJNQ3HYewioaorpwL3mKGLxvW0AOb4pJxqoqP4nFX77y0p00.8.
```

2. Create a machine config file that contains the core username and the hashed password:

```terminal
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
  name: set-core-user-password
spec:
  config:
    ignition:
      version: 3.2.0
    passwd:
      users:
      - name: core 1
        passwordHash: <password> 2
```

This must be core.
The hashed password to use with the core account.
3. Create the machine config by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f <file-name>.yaml
```


The nodes do not reboot and should become available in a few moments. You can use the oc get mcp to watch for the machine config pools to be updated, as shown in the following example:

```
NAME     CONFIG                                             UPDATED   UPDATING   DEGRADED   MACHINECOUNT   READYMACHINECOUNT   UPDATEDMACHINECOUNT   DEGRADEDMACHINECOUNT   AGE
master   rendered-master-d686a3ffc8fdec47280afec446fce8dd   True      False      False      3              3                   3                     0                      64m
worker   rendered-worker-4605605a5b1f9de1d061e9d350f251e5   False     True       False      3              0                   0                     0                      64m
```


1. After the nodes return to the UPDATED=True state, start a debug session for a node by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc debug node/<node_name>
```

2. Set /host as the root directory within the debug shell by running the following command:

```terminal
sh-4.4# chroot /host
```

3. Check the contents of the /etc/shadow file:
Example output

```terminal
...
core:$6$2sE/010goDuRSxxv$o18K52wor.wIwZp:19418:0:99999:7:::
...
```


The hashed password is assigned to the core user.

# Configuring MCO-related custom resources

Besides managing MachineConfig objects, the MCO manages two custom resources (CRs): KubeletConfig and ContainerRuntimeConfig. Those CRs let you change node-level settings impacting how the Kubelet and CRI-O container runtime services behave.

## Creating a KubeletConfig CRD to edit kubelet parameters

The kubelet configuration is currently serialized as an Ignition configuration, so it can be directly edited. However, there is also a new kubelet-config-controller added to the Machine Config Controller (MCC). This lets you use a KubeletConfig custom resource (CR) to edit the kubelet parameters.


[NOTE]
----
As the fields in the kubeletConfig object are passed directly to the kubelet from upstream Kubernetes, the kubelet validates those values directly. Invalid values in the kubeletConfig object might cause cluster nodes to become unavailable. For valid values, see the Kubernetes documentation.
----

Consider the following guidance:

* Edit an existing KubeletConfig CR to modify existing settings or add new settings, instead of creating a CR for each change. It is recommended that you create a CR only to modify a different machine config pool, or for changes that are intended to be temporary, so that you can revert the changes.
* Create one KubeletConfig CR for each machine config pool with all the config changes you want for that pool.
* As needed, create multiple KubeletConfig CRs with a limit of 10 per cluster. For the first KubeletConfig CR, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) creates a machine config appended with kubelet. With each subsequent CR, the controller creates another kubelet machine config with a numeric suffix. For example, if you have a kubelet machine config with a -2 suffix, the next kubelet machine config is appended with -3.


[NOTE]
----
If you are applying a kubelet or container runtime config to a custom machine config pool, the custom role in the machineConfigSelector must match the name of the custom machine config pool.
For example, because the following custom machine config pool is named infra, the custom role must also be infra:

```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfigPool
metadata:
  name: infra
spec:
  machineConfigSelector:
    matchExpressions:
      - {key: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role, operator: In, values: [worker,infra]}
# ...
```

----

If you want to delete the machine configs, delete them in reverse order to avoid exceeding the limit. For example, you delete the kubelet-3 machine config before deleting the kubelet-2 machine config.


[NOTE]
----
If you have a machine config with a kubelet-9 suffix, and you create another KubeletConfig CR, a new machine config is not created, even if there are fewer than 10 kubelet machine configs.
----


```terminal
$ oc get kubeletconfig
```



```terminal
NAME                AGE
set-max-pods        15m
```



```terminal
$ oc get mc | grep kubelet
```



```terminal
...
99-worker-generated-kubelet-1                  b5c5119de007945b6fe6fb215db3b8e2ceb12511   3.2.0             26m
...
```


The following procedure is an example to show how to configure the maximum number of pods per node on the worker nodes.

1. Obtain the label associated with the static MachineConfigPool CR for the type of node you want to configure.
Perform one of the following steps:
1. View the machine config pool:

```terminal
$ oc describe machineconfigpool <name>
```


For example:

```terminal
$ oc describe machineconfigpool worker
```

Example output

```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfigPool
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: 2019-02-08T14:52:39Z
  generation: 1
  labels:
    custom-kubelet: set-max-pods 1
```

If a label has been added it appears under labels.
2. If the label is not present, add a key/value pair:

```terminal
$ oc label machineconfigpool worker custom-kubelet=set-max-pods
```


1. View the available machine configuration objects that you can select:

```terminal
$ oc get machineconfig
```


By default, the two kubelet-related configs are 01-master-kubelet and 01-worker-kubelet.
2. Check the current value for the maximum pods per node:

```terminal
$ oc describe node <node_name>
```


For example:

```terminal
$ oc describe node ci-ln-5grqprb-f76d1-ncnqq-worker-a-mdv94
```


Look for value: pods: <value> in the Allocatable stanza:
Example output

```terminal
Allocatable:
 attachable-volumes-aws-ebs:  25
 cpu:                         3500m
 hugepages-1Gi:               0
 hugepages-2Mi:               0
 memory:                      15341844Ki
 pods:                        250
```

3. Set the maximum pods per node on the worker nodes by creating a custom resource file that contains the kubelet configuration:

[IMPORTANT]
----
Kubelet configurations that target a specific machine config pool also affect any dependent pools. For example, creating a kubelet configuration for the pool containing worker nodes will also apply to any subset pools, including the pool containing infrastructure nodes. To avoid this, you must create a new machine config pool with a selection expression that only includes worker nodes, and have your kubelet configuration target this new pool.
----

```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: KubeletConfig
metadata:
  name: set-max-pods
spec:
  machineConfigPoolSelector:
    matchLabels:
      custom-kubelet: set-max-pods 1
  kubeletConfig:
    maxPods: 500 2
```

Enter the label from the machine config pool.
Add the kubelet configuration. In this example, use maxPods to set the maximum pods per node.

[NOTE]
----
The rate at which the kubelet talks to the API server depends on queries per second (QPS) and burst values. The default values, 50 for kubeAPIQPS and 100 for kubeAPIBurst, are sufficient if there are limited pods running on each node. It is recommended to update the kubelet QPS and burst rates if there are enough CPU and memory resources on the node.

```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: KubeletConfig
metadata:
  name: set-max-pods
spec:
  machineConfigPoolSelector:
    matchLabels:
      custom-kubelet: set-max-pods
  kubeletConfig:
    maxPods: <pod_count>
    kubeAPIBurst: <burst_rate>
    kubeAPIQPS: <QPS>
```

----
1. Update the machine config pool for workers with the label:

```terminal
$ oc label machineconfigpool worker custom-kubelet=set-max-pods
```

2. Create the KubeletConfig object:

```terminal
$ oc create -f change-maxPods-cr.yaml
```

3. Verify that the KubeletConfig object is created:

```terminal
$ oc get kubeletconfig
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                AGE
set-max-pods        15m
```


Depending on the number of worker nodes in the cluster, wait for the worker nodes to be rebooted one by one. For a cluster with 3 worker nodes, this could take about 10 to 15 minutes.
4. Verify that the changes are applied to the node:
1. Check on a worker node that the maxPods value changed:

```terminal
$ oc describe node <node_name>
```

2. Locate the Allocatable stanza:

```terminal
 ...
Allocatable:
  attachable-volumes-gce-pd:  127
  cpu:                        3500m
  ephemeral-storage:          123201474766
  hugepages-1Gi:              0
  hugepages-2Mi:              0
  memory:                     14225400Ki
  pods:                       500 1
 ...
```

In this example, the pods parameter should report the value you set in the KubeletConfig object.
5. Verify the change in the KubeletConfig object:

```terminal
$ oc get kubeletconfigs set-max-pods -o yaml
```


This should show a status of True and type:Success, as shown in the following example:

```yaml
spec:
  kubeletConfig:
    maxPods: 500
  machineConfigPoolSelector:
    matchLabels:
      custom-kubelet: set-max-pods
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2021-06-30T17:04:07Z"
    message: Success
    status: "True"
    type: Success
```


## Creating a ContainerRuntimeConfig CR to edit CRI-O parameters

You can change some of the settings associated with the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CRI-O runtime for the nodes associated with a specific machine config pool (MCP). Using a ContainerRuntimeConfig custom resource (CR), you set the configuration values and add a label to match the MCP. The MCO then rebuilds the crio.conf and storage.conf configuration files on the associated nodes with the updated values.


[NOTE]
----
To revert the changes implemented by using a ContainerRuntimeConfig CR, you must delete the CR. Removing the label from the machine config pool does not revert the changes.
----

You can modify the following settings by using a ContainerRuntimeConfig CR:

* PIDs limit: Setting the PIDs limit in the ContainerRuntimeConfig is expected to be deprecated. If PIDs limits are required, it is recommended to use the podPidsLimit field in the KubeletConfig CR instead. The default podPidsLimit value is 4096 and the default pids_limit value is 0. If podPidsLimit is lower than pids_limit then the effective container PIDs limit is defined by the value set in podPidsLimit.

[NOTE]
----
The CRI-O flag is applied on the cgroup of the container, while the Kubelet flag is set on the cgroup of the pod. Please adjust the PIDs limit accordingly.
----
* Log level: The logLevel parameter sets the CRI-O log_level parameter, which is the level of verbosity for log messages. The default is info (log_level = info). Other options include fatal, panic, error, warn, debug, and trace.
* Overlay size: The overlaySize parameter sets the CRI-O Overlay storage driver size parameter, which is the maximum size of a container image.
* Maximum log size: Setting the maximum log size in the ContainerRuntimeConfig is expected to be deprecated. If a maximum log size is required, it is recommended to use the containerLogMaxSize field in the KubeletConfig CR instead.
* Container runtime: The defaultRuntime parameter sets the container runtime to either runc or crun. The default is runc.

You should have one ContainerRuntimeConfig CR for each machine config pool with all the config changes you want for that pool. If you are applying the same content to all the pools, you only need one ContainerRuntimeConfig CR for all the pools.

You should edit an existing ContainerRuntimeConfig CR to modify existing settings or add new settings instead of creating a new CR for each change. It is recommended to create a new ContainerRuntimeConfig CR only to modify a different machine config pool, or for changes that are intended to be temporary so that you can revert the changes.

You can create multiple ContainerRuntimeConfig CRs, as needed, with a limit of 10 per cluster. For the first ContainerRuntimeConfig CR, the MCO creates a machine config appended with containerruntime. With each subsequent CR, the controller creates a new containerruntime machine config with a numeric suffix. For example, if you have a containerruntime machine config with a -2 suffix, the next containerruntime machine config is appended with -3.

If you want to delete the machine configs, you should delete them in reverse order to avoid exceeding the limit. For example, you should delete the containerruntime-3 machine config before deleting the containerruntime-2 machine config.


[NOTE]
----
If you have a machine config with a containerruntime-9 suffix, and you create another ContainerRuntimeConfig CR, a new machine config is not created, even if there are fewer than 10 containerruntime machine configs.

...
```


The following example sets the log_level field to debug and sets the overlay size to 8 GB:


```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: ContainerRuntimeConfig
metadata:
 name: overlay-size
spec:
 machineConfigPoolSelector:
   matchLabels:
     pools.operator.machineconfiguration.openshift.io/worker: '' 1
 containerRuntimeConfig:
   logLevel: debug 2
   overlaySize: 8G 3
   defaultRuntime: "crun" 4
```


Specifies the machine config pool label. For a container runtime config, the role must match the name of the associated machine config pool.
Optional: Specifies the level of verbosity for log messages.
Optional: Specifies the maximum size of a container image.
Optional: Specifies the container runtime to deploy to new containers. The default value is runc.

To change CRI-O settings using the ContainerRuntimeConfig CR:

1. Create a YAML file for the ContainerRuntimeConfig CR:

```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: ContainerRuntimeConfig
metadata:
 name: overlay-size
spec:
 machineConfigPoolSelector:
   matchLabels:
     pools.operator.machineconfiguration.openshift.io/worker: '' 1
 containerRuntimeConfig: 2
   logLevel: debug
   overlaySize: 8G
```

Specify a label for the machine config pool that you want you want to modify.
Set the parameters as needed.
2. Create the ContainerRuntimeConfig CR:

```terminal
$ oc create -f <file_name>.yaml
```

3. Verify that the CR is created:

```terminal
$ oc get ContainerRuntimeConfig
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME           AGE
overlay-size   3m19s
```

4. Check that a new containerruntime machine config is created:

```terminal
$ oc get machineconfigs | grep containerrun
```

Example output

```terminal
99-worker-generated-containerruntime   2c9371fbb673b97a6fe8b1c52691999ed3a1bfc2  3.2.0  31s
```

5. Monitor the machine config pool until all are shown as ready:

```terminal
$ oc get mcp worker
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME    CONFIG               UPDATED  UPDATING  DEGRADED  MACHINECOUNT  READYMACHINECOUNT  UPDATEDMACHINECOUNT  DEGRADEDMACHINECOUNT  AGE
worker  rendered-worker-169  False    True      False     3             1                  1                    0                     9h
```

6. Verify that the settings were applied in CRI-O:
1. Open an oc debug session to a node in the machine config pool and run chroot /host.

```terminal
$ oc debug node/<node_name>
```


```terminal
sh-4.4# chroot /host
```

2. Verify the changes in the crio.conf file:

```terminal
sh-4.4# crio config | grep 'log_level'
```

Example output

```terminal
log_level = "debug"
```

3. Verify the changes in the `storage.conf`file:

```terminal
sh-4.4# head -n 7 /etc/containers/storage.conf
```

Example output

```
[storage]
  driver = "overlay"
  runroot = "/var/run/containers/storage"
  graphroot = "/var/lib/containers/storage"
  [storage.options]
    additionalimagestores = []
    size = "8G"
```


## Setting the default maximum container root partition size for Overlay with CRI-O

The root partition of each container shows all of the available disk space of the underlying host. Follow this guidance to set a maximum partition size for the root disk of all containers.

To configure the maximum Overlay size, as well as other CRI-O options like the log level, you can create the following ContainerRuntimeConfig custom resource definition (CRD):


```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: ContainerRuntimeConfig
metadata:
 name: overlay-size
spec:
 machineConfigPoolSelector:
   matchLabels:
     custom-crio: overlay-size
 containerRuntimeConfig:
   logLevel: debug
   overlaySize: 8G
```


1. Create the configuration object:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f overlaysize.yml
```

2. To apply the new CRI-O configuration to your worker nodes, edit the worker machine config pool:

```terminal
$ oc edit machineconfigpool worker
```

3. Add the custom-crio label based on the matchLabels name you set in the ContainerRuntimeConfig CRD:

```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfigPool
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2020-07-09T15:46:34Z"
  generation: 3
  labels:
    custom-crio: overlay-size
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/mco-built-in: ""
```

4. Save the changes, then view the machine configs:

```terminal
$ oc get machineconfigs
```


New 99-worker-generated-containerruntime and rendered-worker-xyz objects are created:
Example output

```terminal
99-worker-generated-containerruntime  4173030d89fbf4a7a0976d1665491a4d9a6e54f1   3.2.0             7m42s
rendered-worker-xyz                   4173030d89fbf4a7a0976d1665491a4d9a6e54f1   3.2.0             7m36s
```

5. After those objects are created, monitor the machine config pool for the changes to be applied:

```terminal
$ oc get mcp worker
```


The worker nodes show UPDATING as True, as well as the number of machines, the number updated, and other details:
Example output

```terminal
NAME   CONFIG              UPDATED   UPDATING   DEGRADED  MACHINECOUNT  READYMACHINECOUNT  UPDATEDMACHINECOUNT   DEGRADEDMACHINECOUNT   AGE
worker rendered-worker-xyz False True False     3             2                   2                    0                      20h
```


When complete, the worker nodes transition back to UPDATING as False, and the UPDATEDMACHINECOUNT number matches the MACHINECOUNT:
Example output

```terminal
NAME   CONFIG              UPDATED   UPDATING   DEGRADED  MACHINECOUNT  READYMACHINECOUNT  UPDATEDMACHINECOUNT   DEGRADEDMACHINECOUNT   AGE
worker   rendered-worker-xyz   True      False      False      3         3            3             0           20h
```


Looking at a worker machine, you see that the new 8 GB max size configuration is applied to all of the workers:
Example output

```terminal
head -n 7 /etc/containers/storage.conf
[storage]
  driver = "overlay"
  runroot = "/var/run/containers/storage"
  graphroot = "/var/lib/containers/storage"
  [storage.options]
    additionalimagestores = []
    size = "8G"
```


Looking inside a container, you see that the root partition is now 8 GB:
Example output

```terminal
~ $ df -h
Filesystem                Size      Used Available Use% Mounted on
overlay                   8.0G      8.0K      8.0G   0% /
```


## Creating a drop-in file for the default capabilities of CRI-O

You can change some of the settings associated with the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CRI-O runtime for the nodes associated with a specific machine config pool (MCP). By using a controller custom resource (CR), you set the configuration values and add a label to match the MCP. The Machine Config Operator (MCO) then rebuilds the crio.conf and default.conf configuration files on the associated nodes with the updated values.

Earlier versions of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform included specific machine configs by default. If you updated to a later version of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, those machine configs were retained to ensure that clusters running on the same Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version have the same machine configs.

You can create multiple ContainerRuntimeConfig CRs, as needed, with a limit of 10 per cluster. For the first ContainerRuntimeConfig CR, the MCO creates a machine config appended with containerruntime. With each subsequent CR, the controller creates a containerruntime machine config with a numeric suffix. For example, if you have a containerruntime machine config with a -2 suffix, the next containerruntime machine config is appended with -3.

If you want to delete the machine configs, delete them in reverse order to avoid exceeding the limit. For example, delete the containerruntime-3 machine config before you delete the containerruntime-2 machine config.


[NOTE]
----
If you have a machine config with a containerruntime-9 suffix and you create another ContainerRuntimeConfig CR, a new machine config is not created, even if there are fewer than 10 containerruntime machine configs.
