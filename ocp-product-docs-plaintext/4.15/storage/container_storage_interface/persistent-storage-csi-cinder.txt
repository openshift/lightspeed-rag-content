OpenStack Cinder CSI Driver Operator

Overview
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is capable of provisioning persistent volumes (PVs) using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for OpenStack Cinder.

Familiarity with persistent storage and configuring CSI volumes is recommended when working with a Container Storage Interface (CSI) Operator and driver.

To create CSI-provisioned PVs that mount to OpenStack Cinder storage assets, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installs the OpenStack Cinder CSI Driver Operator and the OpenStack Cinder CSI driver in the openshift-cluster-csi-drivers namespace.

The OpenStack Cinder CSI Driver Operator provides a CSI storage class that you can use to create PVCs. You can disable this default storage class if desired (see Managing the default storage class).

The OpenStack Cinder CSI driver enables you to create and mount OpenStack Cinder PVs.


Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform provides automatic migration for the Cinder in-tree volume plugin to its equivalent CSI driver. For more information, see CSI automatic migration.
About CSI
Storage vendors have traditionally provided storage drivers as part of Kubernetes. With the implementation of the Container Storage Interface (CSI), third-party providers can instead deliver storage plugins using a standard interface without ever having to change the core Kubernetes code.

CSI Operators give Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform users storage options, such as volume snapshots, that are not possible with in-tree volume plugins.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform defaults to using the CSI plugin to provision Cinder storage.
Making OpenStack Cinder CSI the default storage class
The OpenStack Cinder CSI driver uses the cinder.csi.openstack.org parameter key to support dynamic provisioning.

To enable OpenStack Cinder CSI provisioning in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, it is recommended that you overwrite the default in-tree storage class with standard-csi. Alternatively, you can create the persistent volume claim (PVC) and specify the storage class as "standard-csi".

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, the default storage class references the in-tree Cinder driver. However, with CSI automatic migration enabled, volumes created using the default storage class actually use the CSI driver.

Use the following steps to apply the standard-csi storage class by overwriting the default in-tree storage class.

List the storage class:

Change the value of the annotation storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class to false for the default storage class, as shown in the following example:

Make another storage class the default by adding or modifying the annotation as storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class=true.

Verify that the PVC is now referencing the CSI storage class by default:

Optional: You can define a new PVC without having to specify the storage class:

Optional: After the new file has been configured, create it in your cluster:
