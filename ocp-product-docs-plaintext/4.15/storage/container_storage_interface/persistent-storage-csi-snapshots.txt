CSI volume snapshots

This document describes how to use volume snapshots with supported Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers to help protect against data loss in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. Familiarity with persistent volumes is suggested.
Overview of CSI volume snapshots
A snapshot represents the state of the storage volume in a cluster at a particular point in time. Volume snapshots can be used to provision a new volume.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform supports Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume snapshots by default. However, a specific CSI driver is required.

With CSI volume snapshots, a cluster administrator can:

Deploy a third-party CSI driver that supports snapshots.

Create a new persistent volume claim (PVC) from an existing volume snapshot.

Take a snapshot of an existing PVC.

Restore a snapshot as a different PVC.

Delete an existing volume snapshot.


With CSI volume snapshots, an app developer can:

Use volume snapshots as building blocks for developing application- or cluster-level storage backup solutions.

Rapidly rollback to a previous development version.

Use storage more efficiently by not having to make a full copy each time.


Be aware of the following when using volume snapshots:

Support is only available for CSI drivers. In-tree and FlexVolumes are not supported.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform only ships with select CSI drivers. For CSI drivers that are not provided by an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Driver Operator, it is recommended to use the CSI drivers provided by
community or storage vendors. Follow the installation instructions furnished by the CSI driver provider.

CSI drivers may or may not have implemented the volume snapshot functionality. CSI drivers that have provided support for volume snapshots will likely use the csi-external-snapshotter sidecar. See documentation provided by the CSI driver for details.
CSI snapshot controller and sidecar
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform provides a snapshot controller that is deployed into the control plane. In addition, your CSI driver vendor provides the CSI snapshot sidecar as a helper container that is installed during the CSI driver installation.

The CSI snapshot controller and sidecar provide volume snapshotting through the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform API. These external components run in the cluster.

The external controller is deployed by the CSI Snapshot Controller Operator.

External controller
The CSI snapshot controller binds VolumeSnapshot and VolumeSnapshotContent objects. The controller manages dynamic provisioning by creating and deleting VolumeSnapshotContent objects.
External sidecar
Your CSI driver vendor provides the csi-external-snapshotter sidecar. This is a separate helper container that is deployed with the CSI driver. The sidecar manages snapshots by triggering CreateSnapshot and DeleteSnapshot operations. Follow the installation instructions provided by your vendor.
About the CSI Snapshot Controller Operator
The CSI Snapshot Controller Operator runs in the openshift-cluster-storage-operator namespace. It is installed by the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) in all clusters by default.

The CSI Snapshot Controller Operator installs the CSI snapshot controller, which runs in the openshift-cluster-storage-operator namespace.

Volume snapshot CRDs
During Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation, the CSI Snapshot Controller Operator creates the following snapshot custom resource definitions (CRDs) in the snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1 API group:


VolumeSnapshotContent
A snapshot taken of a volume in the cluster that has been provisioned by a cluster administrator.
VolumeSnapshot
Similar to the PersistentVolumeClaim object, the VolumeSnapshot CRD defines a developer request for a snapshot. The CSI Snapshot Controller Operator runs the CSI snapshot controller, which handles the binding of a VolumeSnapshot CRD with an appropriate VolumeSnapshotContent CRD. The binding is a one-to-one mapping.
VolumeSnapshotClass
Allows a cluster administrator to specify different attributes belonging to a VolumeSnapshot object. These attributes may differ among snapshots taken of the same volume on the storage system, in which case they would not be expressed by using the same storage class of a persistent volume claim.
Volume snapshot provisioning
There are two ways to provision snapshots: dynamically and manually.

Dynamic provisioning
Instead of using a preexisting snapshot, you can request that a snapshot be taken dynamically from a persistent volume claim. Parameters are specified using a VolumeSnapshotClass CRD.
Manual provisioning
As a cluster administrator, you can manually pre-provision a number of VolumeSnapshotContent objects. These carry the real volume snapshot details available to cluster users.
Creating a volume snapshot
When you create a VolumeSnapshot object, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform creates a volume snapshot.

Logged in to a running Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

A PVC created using a CSI driver that supports VolumeSnapshot objects.

A storage class to provision the storage back end.

No pods are using the persistent volume claim (PVC) that you want to take a snapshot of.


To dynamically create a volume snapshot:

Create a file with the VolumeSnapshotClass object described by the following YAML:

Create the object you saved in the previous step by entering the following command:

Create a VolumeSnapshot object:

Create the object you saved in the previous step by entering the following command:


To manually provision a snapshot:

Provide a value for the volumeSnapshotContentName parameter as the source for the snapshot, in addition to defining volume snapshot class as shown above.

Create the object you saved in the previous step by entering the following command:


After the snapshot has been created in the cluster, additional details about the snapshot are available.

To display details about the volume snapshot that was created, enter the following command:

To verify that the volume snapshot was created, enter the following command:

To verify that the snapshot is ready, confirm that the VolumeSnapshot object has readyToUse: true.
Deleting a volume snapshot
You can configure how Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform deletes volume snapshots.

Specify the deletion policy that you require in the VolumeSnapshotClass object, as shown in the following example:

Delete the volume snapshot by entering the following command:

If the deletion policy is set to Retain, delete the volume snapshot content by entering the following command:

Optional: If the VolumeSnapshot object is not successfully deleted, enter the following command to remove any finalizers for the leftover resource so that the delete operation can continue:
Restoring a volume snapshot
The VolumeSnapshot CRD content can be used to restore the existing volume to a previous state.

After your VolumeSnapshot CRD is bound and the readyToUse value is set to true, you can use that resource to provision a new volume that is pre-populated with data from the snapshot.

A persistent volume claim (PVC) created using a Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver that supports volume snapshots.

A storage class to provision the storage back end.

A volume snapshot has been created and is ready to use.


Specify a VolumeSnapshot data source on a PVC as shown in the following:

Create a PVC by entering the following command:

Verify that the restored PVC has been created by entering the following command:
