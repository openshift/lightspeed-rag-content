AliCloud Disk CSI Driver Operator

Overview
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is capable of provisioning persistent volumes (PVs) using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for Alibaba AliCloud Disk Storage.

Familiarity with persistent storage and configuring CSI volumes is recommended when working with a CSI Operator and driver.

To create CSI-provisioned PVs that mount to AliCloud Disk storage assets, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installs the AliCloud Disk CSI Driver Operator and the AliCloud Disk CSI driver, by default, in the openshift-cluster-csi-drivers namespace.

The AliCloud Disk CSI Driver Operator provides a storage class (alicloud-disk) that you can use to create persistent volume claims (PVCs). The AliCloud Disk CSI Driver Operator supports dynamic volume provisioning by allowing storage volumes to be created on demand, eliminating the need for cluster administrators to pre-provision storage. You can disable this default storage class if desired (see Managing the default storage class).

The AliCloud Disk CSI driver enables you to create and mount AliCloud Disk PVs.
About CSI
Storage vendors have traditionally provided storage drivers as part of Kubernetes. With the implementation of the Container Storage Interface (CSI), third-party providers can instead deliver storage plugins using a standard interface without ever having to change the core Kubernetes code.

CSI Operators give Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform users storage options, such as volume snapshots, that are not possible with in-tree volume plugins.
