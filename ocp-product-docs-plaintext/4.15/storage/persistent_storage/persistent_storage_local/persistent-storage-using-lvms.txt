Persistent storage using Logical Volume Manager Storage

Logical Volume Manager Storage uses the TopoLVM CSI driver to dynamically provision local storage on the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" clusters.

LVM Storage creates thin-provisioned volumes using Logical Volume Manager and provides dynamic provisioning of block storage on a limited resources cluster.

You can create volume groups, persistent volume claims (PVCs), volume snapshots, and volume clones by using LVM Storage.
Logical Volume Manager Storage installation
You can install Logical Volume Manager (LVM) Storage on an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster and configure it to dynamically provision storage for your workloads.

You can install LVM Storage by using the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" CLI (oc), "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" web console, or Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM).

When using LVM Storage on multi-node clusters, LVM Storage only supports provisioning local storage. LVM Storage does not support storage data replication mechanisms across nodes. You must ensure storage data replication through active or passive replication mechanisms to avoid a single point of failure.
Prerequisites to install LVM Storage
The prerequisites to install LVM Storage are as follows:

Ensure that you have a minimum of 10 milliCPU and 100 MiB of RAM.

Ensure that every managed cluster has dedicated disks that are used to provision storage. LVM Storage uses only those disks that are empty and do not contain file system signatures. To ensure that the disks are empty and do not contain file system signatures, wipe the disks before using them.

Before installing LVM Storage in a private CI environment where you can reuse the storage devices that you configured in the previous LVM Storage installation, ensure that you have wiped the disks that are not in use. If you do not wipe the disks before installing LVM Storage, you cannot reuse the disks without manual intervention.

If you want to install LVM Storage by using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM), ensure that you have installed RHACM on an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster. See the "Installing LVM Storage using RHACM" section.

About the LVMCluster custom resource
Limitations to configure the size of the devices used in LVM Storage
The limitations to configure the size of the devices that you can use to provision storage using LVM Storage are as follows:

The total storage size that you can provision is limited by the size of the underlying Logical Volume Manager (LVM) thin pool and the over-provisioning factor.

The size of the logical volume depends on the size of the Physical Extent (PE) and the Logical Extent (LE).



Theoretical size.

Tested size.
About the LVMCluster custom resource
You can configure the LVMCluster CR to perform the following actions:

Create LVM volume groups that you can use to provision persistent volume claims (PVCs).

The LVMCluster CR fields are described in the following table:


Reusing a volume group from the previous LVM Storage installation

About adding devices to a volume group

Adding worker nodes to single-node OpenShift clusters


About adding devices to a volume group
The deviceSelector field in the LVMCluster CR contains the configuration to specify the paths to the devices that you want to add to the LVM volume group.

You can specify the device paths in the deviceSelector.paths field, the deviceSelector.optionalPaths field, or both. If you do not specify the device paths in both the deviceSelector.paths field and the deviceSelector.optionalPaths field, LVM Storage adds the supported unused devices to the LVM volume group.

The devices that you want to add to the volume group must be supported by LVM Storage. For information about unsupported devices, see "Devices not supported by LVM Storage" in the "Additional resources" section.

If you do not add the deviceSelector field in the LVMCluster CR, LVM Storage automatically adds the new devices when the devices are available.

LVM Storage adds the devices to the LVM volume group only if the following conditions are met:

The device path exists.

The device is supported by LVM Storage.


You can also add the path to the RAID arrays to integrate the RAID arrays with LVM Storage. For more information, see "Integrating RAID arrays with LVM Storage" in the "Additional resources" section.

After a device is added to the LVM volume group, it cannot be removed.
Devices not supported by LVM Storage

Integrating software RAID arrays with LVM Storage
Devices not supported by LVM Storage
When you are adding the device paths in the deviceSelector field of the LVMCluster custom resource (CR), ensure that the devices are supported by LVM Storage. If you add paths to the unsupported devices, LVM Storage excludes the devices to avoid complexity in managing logical volumes.

If you do not specify any device path in the deviceSelector field, LVM Storage adds only the unused devices that it supports.

To get information about the devices, run the following command:

$ lsblk --paths --json -o \
NAME,ROTA,TYPE,SIZE,MODEL,VENDOR,RO,STATE,KNAME,SERIAL,PARTLABEL,FSTYPE
LVM Storage does not support the following devices:


Read-only devices
Devices with the ro parameter set to true.
Suspended devices
Devices with the state parameter set to suspended.
ROM devices
Devices with the type parameter set to rom.
LVM partition devices
Devices with the type parameter set to lvm.
Devices with invalid partition labels
Devices with the partlabel parameter set to bios, boot, or reserved.
Devices with an invalid filesystem
Devices with the fstype parameter set to any value other than null or LVM2_member.
Devices that are part of another volume group
To get the information about the volume groups of the device, run the following command:
Devices with bind mounts
To get the mount points of a device, run the following command:
Devices that contain children devices


It is recommended to wipe the device before using it in LVM Storage to prevent unexpected behavior.

Ways to create an LVMCluster custom resource
You can create an LVMCluster custom resource (CR) by using the OpenShift CLI (oc) or the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" web console. If you have installed LVM Storage by using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM), you can also create an LVMCluster CR by using RHACM.

Upon creating the LVMCluster CR, LVM Storage creates the following system-managed CRs:

A storageClass and volumeSnapshotClass for each device class.

LVMVolumeGroup: This CR is a specific type of persistent volume (PV) that is backed by an LVM volume group. It tracks the individual volume groups across multiple nodes.

LVMVolumeGroupNodeStatus: This CR tracks the status of the volume groups on a node.


Reusing a volume group from the previous LVM Storage installation
You can reuse an existing volume group (VG) from the previous LVM Storage installation instead of creating a new VG.

You can only reuse a VG but not the logical volume associated with the VG.

You can perform this procedure only while creating an LVMCluster custom resource (CR).
The VG that you want to reuse must not be corrupted.

The VG that you want to reuse must have the lvms tag. For more information on adding tags to LVM objects, see Grouping LVM objects with tags.


Open the LVMCluster CR YAML file.

Configure the LVMCluster CR parameters as described in the following example:

Save the LVMCluster CR YAML file.


To view the devices that are part a volume group, run the following command:

$ pvs -S vgname=<vg_name> 1
Replace <vg_name> with the name of the volume group.
Integrating software RAID arrays with LVM Storage
You can create the Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) array by using the mdadm utility, and integrate the RAID array with LVM Storage. Logical Volume Manager (LVM) does not support creating a software RAID.

You can integrate the RAID array with LVM Storage while creating the LVMCluster custom resource (CR). If you have already created an LVMCluster CR, you can edit the existing LVMCluster CR to add the RAID array.

You created a software RAID during the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation.

You have installed LVM Storage.


Open the LVMCluster CR YAML file. If you have already created the LVMCluster CR, edit the existing LVMCluster CR by running the following command:

Add the path to the RAID array in the deviceSelector field of the LVMCluster CR YAML file.

Save the LVMCluster CR YAML file.


If you do not add the path to the RAID array in the deviceSelector field, LVM Storage does not recognize the RAID array.
Creating an LVMCluster CR by using the CLI

Ways to scale up the storage of clusters
"Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" supports additional worker nodes for clusters on bare metal user-provisioned infrastructure. You can scale up the storage of clusters either by adding new worker nodes with available storage or by adding new devices to the existing worker nodes.

Logical Volume Manager (LVM) Storage detects and uses additional worker nodes when the nodes become active.

To add a new device to the existing worker nodes on a cluster, you must add the path to the new device in the deviceSelector field of the LVMCluster custom resource (CR).

You can add the deviceSelector field in the LVMCluster CR only while creating the LVMCluster CR. If you have not added the deviceSelector field while creating the LVMCluster CR, you must delete the LVMCluster CR and create a new LVMCluster CR containing the deviceSelector field.
If you do not add the deviceSelector field in the LVMCluster CR, LVM Storage automatically adds the new devices when the devices are available.

LVM Storage adds only the supported devices. For information about unsupported devices, see "Devices not supported by LVM Storage" in the "Additional resources" section.
