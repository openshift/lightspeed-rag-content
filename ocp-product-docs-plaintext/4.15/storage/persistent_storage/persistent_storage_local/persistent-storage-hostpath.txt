Persistent storage using hostPath

A hostPath volume in an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster mounts a file or directory from the host node's filesystem into your pod. Most pods will not need a hostPath volume, but it does offer a quick option for testing should an application require it.

The cluster administrator must configure pods to run as privileged. This grants access to pods in the same node.
Overview
"Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" supports hostPath mounting for development and testing on a single-node cluster.

In a production cluster, you would not use hostPath. Instead, a cluster administrator would provision a network resource, such as a GCE Persistent Disk volume, an NFS share, or an Amazon EBS volume. Network resources support the use of storage classes to set up dynamic provisioning.

A hostPath volume must be provisioned statically.

Do not mount to the container root, /, or any path that is the same in the host and the container. This can corrupt your host system if the container is sufficiently privileged. It is safe to mount the host by using /host. The following example shows the / directory from the host being mounted into the container at /host.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test-host-mount
spec:
  containers:
  - image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi
    name: test-container
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'sleep 3600']
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /host
      name: host-slash
  volumes:
   - name: host-slash
     hostPath:
       path: /
       type: ''
Statically provisioning hostPath volumes
A pod that uses a hostPath volume must be referenced by manual (static) provisioning.

Define the persistent volume (PV). Create a file, pv.yaml, with the PersistentVolume object definition:

Create the PV from the file:

Define the persistent volume claim (PVC). Create a file, pvc.yaml, with the PersistentVolumeClaim object definition:

Create the PVC from the file:
Mounting the hostPath share in a privileged pod
After the persistent volume claim has been created, it can be used inside by an application. The following example demonstrates mounting this share inside of a pod.

A persistent volume claim exists that is mapped to the underlying hostPath share.


Create a privileged pod that mounts the existing persistent volume claim:
