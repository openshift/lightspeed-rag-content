Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation

Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation is a provider of agnostic persistent storage for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform supporting file, block, and object storage, either in-house or in hybrid clouds. As a Red Hat storage solution, Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation is completely integrated with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform for deployment, management, and monitoring.

Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation provides its own documentation library. The complete set of Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation documentation is available at https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_data_foundation.

OpenShift Data Foundation on top of Red Hat Hyperconverged Infrastructure (RHHI) for Virtualization, which uses hyperconverged nodes that host virtual machines installed with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, is not a supported configuration. For more information about supported platforms, see the Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation Supportability and Interoperability Guide.
