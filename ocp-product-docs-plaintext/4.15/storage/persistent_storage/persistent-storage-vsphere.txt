Persistent storage using VMware vSphere volumes

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform allows use of VMware vSphere's Virtual Machine Disk (VMDK) volumes. You can provision your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster with persistent storage using VMware vSphere. Some familiarity with Kubernetes and VMware vSphere is assumed.

VMware vSphere volumes can be provisioned dynamically. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform creates the disk in vSphere and attaches this disk to the correct image.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform provisions new volumes as independent persistent disks that can freely attach and detach the volume on any node in the cluster. Consequently, you cannot back up volumes that use snapshots, or restore volumes from snapshots. See Snapshot Limitations for more information.
The Kubernetes persistent volume framework allows administrators to provision a cluster with persistent storage and gives users a way to request those resources without having any knowledge of the underlying infrastructure.

Persistent volumes are not bound to a single project or namespace; they can be shared across the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. Persistent volume claims are specific to a project or namespace and can be requested by users.

For new installations, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.13 and later provides automatic migration for the vSphere in-tree volume plugin to its equivalent CSI driver. Updating to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15 and later also provides automatic migration. For more information about updating and migration, see CSI automatic migration.

CSI automatic migration should be seamless. Migration does not change how you use all existing API objects, such as persistent volumes, persistent volume claims, and storage classes.

Dynamically provisioning VMware vSphere volumes
Dynamically provisioning VMware vSphere volumes is the recommended method.
Prerequisites
An Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster installed on a VMware vSphere version that meets the requirements for the components that you use. See Installing a cluster on vSphere for information about vSphere version support.


You can use either of the following procedures to dynamically provision these volumes using the default storage class.

Dynamically provisioning VMware vSphere volumes using the UI
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installs a default storage class, named thin, that uses the thin disk format for provisioning volumes.

Storage must exist in the underlying infrastructure before it can be mounted as a volume in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.


In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform console, click Storage â†’ Persistent Volume Claims.

In the persistent volume claims overview, click Create Persistent Volume Claim.

Define the required options on the resulting page.

Click Create to create the persistent volume claim and generate a persistent volume.
Dynamically provisioning VMware vSphere volumes using the CLI
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installs a default StorageClass, named thin, that uses the thin disk format for provisioning volumes.

Storage must exist in the underlying infrastructure before it can be mounted as a volume in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.


You can define a VMware vSphere PersistentVolumeClaim by creating a file, pvc.yaml, with the following contents:

Enter the following command to create the PersistentVolumeClaim object from the file:
Statically provisioning VMware vSphere volumes
To statically provision VMware vSphere volumes you must create the virtual machine disks for reference by the persistent volume framework.

Storage must exist in the underlying infrastructure before it can be mounted as a volume in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.


Create the virtual machine disks. Virtual machine disks (VMDKs) must be created manually before statically provisioning VMware vSphere volumes. Use either of the following methods:

Create a persistent volume that references the VMDKs. Create a file, pv1.yaml, with the PersistentVolume object definition:

Create the PersistentVolume object from the file:

Create a persistent volume claim that maps to the persistent volume you created in the previous step.  Create a file, pvc1.yaml, with the PersistentVolumeClaim object definition:

Create the PersistentVolumeClaim object from the file:


Formatting VMware vSphere volumes
Before Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform mounts the volume and passes it to a container, it checks that the volume contains a file system that is specified by the fsType parameter value in the PersistentVolume (PV) definition. If the device is not formatted with the file system, all data from the device is erased, and the device is automatically formatted with the specified file system.

Because Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform formats them before the first use, you can use unformatted vSphere volumes as PVs.
