Enabling features using feature gates

As an administrator, you can use feature gates to enable features that are not part of the default set of features.
Understanding feature gates
You can use the FeatureGate custom resource (CR) to enable specific feature sets in your cluster. A feature set is a collection of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform features that are not enabled by default.

You can activate the following feature set by using the FeatureGate CR:

TechPreviewNoUpgrade. This feature set is a subset of the current Technology Preview features. This feature set allows you to enable these Technology Preview features on test clusters, where you can fully test them, while leaving the features disabled on production clusters.


For more information about the features activated by the TechPreviewNoUpgrade feature gate, see the following topics:

Shared Resources CSI Driver and Build CSI Volumes in OpenShift Builds

CSI inline ephemeral volumes

Swap memory on nodes

Managing the default storage class

Pod security admission enforcement.
Enabling feature sets at installation
You can enable feature sets for all nodes in the cluster by editing the install-config.yaml file before you deploy the cluster.

You have an install-config.yaml file.


Use the featureSet parameter to specify the name of the feature set you want to enable, such as TechPreviewNoUpgrade:

Save the file and reference it when using the installation program to deploy the cluster.


You can verify that the feature gates are enabled by looking at the kubelet.conf file on a node after the nodes return to the ready state.

From the Administrator perspective in the web console, navigate to Compute -> Nodes.

Select a node.

In the Node details page, click Terminal.

In the terminal window, change your root directory to /host:

Enabling feature sets using the web console
You can use the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console to enable feature sets for all of the nodes in a cluster by editing the FeatureGate custom resource (CR).

To enable feature sets:

In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, switch to the Administration -> Custom Resource Definitions page.

On the Custom Resource Definitions page, click FeatureGate.

On the Custom Resource Definition Details page, click the Instances tab.

Click the cluster feature gate, then click the YAML tab.

Edit the cluster instance to add specific feature sets:

Enabling feature sets using the CLI
You can use the OpenShift CLI (oc) to enable feature sets for all of the nodes in a cluster by editing the FeatureGate custom resource (CR).

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).


To enable feature sets:

Edit the FeatureGate CR named cluster:
