Estimating the number of pods your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform nodes can hold

As a cluster administrator, you can use the OpenShift Cluster Capacity Tool to view the number of pods that can be scheduled to increase the current resources before they become exhausted, and to ensure any future pods can be scheduled. This capacity comes from an individual node host in a cluster, and includes CPU, memory, disk space, and others.
Understanding the OpenShift Cluster Capacity Tool
The OpenShift Cluster Capacity Tool simulates a sequence of scheduling decisions to determine how many instances of an input pod can be scheduled on the cluster before it is exhausted of resources to provide a more accurate estimation.

The remaining allocatable capacity is a rough estimation, because it does not count all of the resources being distributed among nodes. It analyzes only the remaining resources and estimates the available capacity that is still consumable in terms of a number of instances of a pod with given requirements that can be scheduled in a cluster.

Also, pods might only have scheduling support on particular sets of nodes based on its selection and affinity criteria. As a result, the estimation of which remaining pods a cluster can schedule can be difficult.
You can run the OpenShift Cluster Capacity Tool as a stand-alone utility from the command line, or as a job in a pod inside an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. Running the tool as job inside of a pod enables you to run it multiple times without intervention.
Running the OpenShift Cluster Capacity Tool on the command line
You can run the OpenShift Cluster Capacity Tool from the command line to estimate the number of pods that can be scheduled onto your cluster.

You create a sample pod spec file, which the tool uses for estimating resource usage. The pod spec specifies its resource requirements as limits or requests. The cluster capacity tool takes the pod's resource requirements into account for its estimation analysis.

Run the OpenShift Cluster Capacity Tool, which is available as a container image from the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog.

Create a sample pod spec file:


To use the cluster capacity tool on the command line:

From the terminal, log in to the Red Hat Registry:

Pull the cluster capacity tool image:

Run the cluster capacity tool:
Running the OpenShift Cluster Capacity Tool as a job inside a pod
Running the OpenShift Cluster Capacity Tool as a job inside of a pod allows you to run the tool multiple times without needing user intervention. You run the OpenShift Cluster Capacity Tool as a job by using a ConfigMap object.

Download and install OpenShift Cluster Capacity Tool.

To run the cluster capacity tool:

Create the cluster role:

Create the service account:

Add the role to the service account:

Define and create the pod spec:

Created a config map object by running the following command:

Create the job using the below example of a job specification file:
