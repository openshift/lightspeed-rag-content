Placing pods on specific nodes using node selectors

A node selector specifies a map of key-value pairs. The rules are defined using custom labels on nodes and selectors specified in pods.

For the pod to be eligible to run on a node, the pod must have the indicated key-value pairs as the label on the node.

If you are using node affinity and node selectors in the same pod configuration, see the important considerations below.
Using node selectors to control pod placement
You can use node selectors on pods and labels on nodes to control where the pod is scheduled. With node selectors, "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" schedules the pods on nodes that contain matching labels.

You add labels to a node, a compute machine set, or a machine config. Adding the label to the compute machine set ensures that if the node or machine goes down, new nodes have the label. Labels added to a node or machine config do not persist if the node or machine goes down.

To add node selectors to an existing pod, add a node selector to the controlling object for that pod, such as a ReplicaSet object, DaemonSet object, StatefulSet object, Deployment object, or DeploymentConfig object. Any existing pods under that controlling object are recreated on a node with a matching label. If you are creating a new pod, you can add the node selector directly to the pod spec. If the pod does not have a controlling object, you must delete the pod, edit the pod spec, and recreate the pod.

You cannot add a node selector directly to an existing scheduled pod.
To add a node selector to existing pods, determine the controlling object for that pod. For example, the router-default-66d5cf9464-m2g75 pod is controlled by the router-default-66d5cf9464 replica set:

$ oc describe pod router-default-66d5cf9464-7pwkc
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
# ...
Name:               router-default-66d5cf9464-7pwkc
Namespace:          openshift-ingress
# ...
Controlled By:      ReplicaSet/router-default-66d5cf9464
# ...
The web console lists the controlling object under ownerReferences in the pod YAML:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: router-default-66d5cf9464-7pwkc
# ...
  ownerReferences:
    - apiVersion: apps/v1
      kind: ReplicaSet
      name: router-default-66d5cf9464
      uid: d81dd094-da26-11e9-a48a-128e7edf0312
      controller: true
      blockOwnerDeletion: true
# ...
Add labels to a node by using a compute machine set or editing the node directly:
