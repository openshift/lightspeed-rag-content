Run Once Duration Override Operator overview

You can use the Run Once Duration Override Operator to specify a maximum time limit that run-once pods can be active for.

The Run Once Duration Override Operator is not currently available for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15. The Operator is planned to be released in the near future.
About the Run Once Duration Override Operator
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform relies on run-once pods to perform tasks such as deploying a pod or performing a build. Run-once pods are pods that have a RestartPolicy of Never or OnFailure.

Cluster administrators can use the Run Once Duration Override Operator to force a limit on the time that those run-once pods can be active. After the time limit expires, the cluster will try to actively terminate those pods. The main reason to have such a limit is to prevent tasks such as builds to run for an excessive amount of time.

To apply the run-once duration override from the Run Once Duration Override Operator to run-once pods, you must enable it on each applicable namespace.

If both the run-once pod and the Run Once Duration Override Operator have their activeDeadlineSeconds value set, the lower of the two values is used.
