Overriding the active deadline for run-once pods

You can use the Run Once Duration Override Operator to specify a maximum time limit that run-once pods can be active for. By enabling the run-once duration override on a namespace, all future run-once pods created or updated in that namespace have their activeDeadlineSeconds field set to the value specified by the Run Once Duration Override Operator.

The Run Once Duration Override Operator is not currently available for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15. The Operator is planned to be released in the near future.
Installing the Run Once Duration Override Operator
You can use the web console to install the Run Once Duration Override Operator.

You have access to the cluster with cluster-admin privileges.

You have access to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.


Log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

Enabling the run-once duration override on a namespace
To apply the run-once duration override from the Run Once Duration Override Operator to run-once pods, you must enable it on each applicable namespace.

The Run Once Duration Override Operator is installed.


Log in to the OpenShift CLI.

Add the label to enable the run-once duration override to your namespace:


After you enable the run-once duration override on this namespace, future run-once pods that are created in this namespace will have their activeDeadlineSeconds field set to the override value from the Run Once Duration Override Operator. Existing pods in this namespace will also have their activeDeadlineSeconds value set when they are updated next.

Create a test run-once pod in the namespace that you enabled the run-once duration override on:

Verify that the pod has its activeDeadlineSeconds field set:
Updating the run-once active deadline override value
You can customize the override value that the Run Once Duration Override Operator applies to run-once pods. The predefined value is 3600 seconds, or 1 hour.

You have access to the cluster with cluster-admin privileges.

You have installed the Run Once Duration Override Operator.


Log in to the OpenShift CLI.

Edit the RunOnceDurationOverride resource:

Update the activeDeadlineSeconds field:

Save the file to apply the changes.


Any future run-once pods created in namespaces where the run-once duration override is enabled will have their activeDeadlineSeconds field set to this new value. Existing run-once pods in these namespaces will receive this new value when they are updated.
