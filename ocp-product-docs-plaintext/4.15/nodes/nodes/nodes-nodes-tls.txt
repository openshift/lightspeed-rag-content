Enabling TLS security profiles for the kubelet

You can use a TLS (Transport Layer Security) security profile to define which TLS ciphers are required by the kubelet when it is acting as an HTTP server. The kubelet uses its HTTP/GRPC server to communicate with the Kubernetes API server, which sends commands to pods, gathers logs, and run exec commands on pods through the kubelet.

A TLS security profile defines the TLS ciphers that the Kubernetes API server must use when connecting with the kubelet to protect communication between the kubelet and the Kubernetes API server.

By default, when the kubelet acts as a client with the Kubernetes API server, it automatically negotiates the TLS parameters with the API server.
Understanding TLS security profiles
You can use a TLS (Transport Layer Security) security profile to define which TLS ciphers are required by various Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform components. The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform TLS security profiles are based on Mozilla recommended configurations.

You can specify one of the following TLS security profiles for each component:


When using one of the predefined profile types, the effective profile configuration is subject to change between releases. For example, given a specification to use the Intermediate profile deployed on release X.Y.Z, an upgrade to release X.Y.Z+1 might cause a new profile configuration to be applied, resulting in a rollout.
Configuring the TLS security profile for the kubelet
To configure a TLS security profile for the kubelet when it is acting as an HTTP server, create a KubeletConfig custom resource (CR) to specify a predefined or custom TLS security profile for specific nodes. If a TLS security profile is not configured, the default TLS security profile is Intermediate.

apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: KubeletConfig
 ...
spec:
  tlsSecurityProfile:
    old: {}
    type: Old
  machineConfigPoolSelector:
    matchLabels:
      pools.operator.machineconfiguration.openshift.io/worker: ""
#...
You can see the ciphers and the minimum TLS version of the configured TLS security profile in the kubelet.conf file on a configured node.

You are logged in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform as a user with the cluster-admin role.


Create a KubeletConfig CR to configure the TLS security profile:

Create the KubeletConfig object:


To verify that the profile is set,  perform the following steps after the nodes are in the Ready state:

Start a debug session for a configured node:

Set /host as the root directory within the debug shell:
