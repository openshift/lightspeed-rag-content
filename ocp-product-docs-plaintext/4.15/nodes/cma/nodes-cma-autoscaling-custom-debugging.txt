Gathering debugging data

When opening a support case, it is helpful to provide debugging information about your cluster to Red Hat Support.

To help troubleshoot your issue, provide the following information:

Data gathered using the must-gather tool.

The unique cluster ID.


You can use the must-gather tool to collect data about the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator and its components, including the following items:

The openshift-keda namespace and its child objects.

The Custom Metric Autoscaler Operator installation objects.

The Custom Metric Autoscaler Operator CRD objects.
Gathering debugging data
The following command runs the must-gather tool for the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator:

$ oc adm must-gather --image="$(oc get packagemanifests openshift-custom-metrics-autoscaler-operator \
-n openshift-marketplace \
-o jsonpath='{.status.channels[?(@.name=="stable")].currentCSVDesc.annotations.containerImage}')"
The standard Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform must-gather command, oc adm must-gather, does not collect Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator data.
You are logged in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform as a user with the cluster-admin role.

The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI (oc) installed.


Navigate to the directory where you want to store the must-gather data.

Perform one of the following:

Create a compressed file from the must-gather directory that was created in your working directory. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux
operating system, run the following command:

Attach the compressed file to your support case on the Red Hat Customer Portal.
