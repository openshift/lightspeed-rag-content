Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.12.1-384 release notes
This release of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.12.1-384 provides a bug fix for running the Operator in an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. The following advisory is available for the RHBA-2024:2043.

Before installing this version of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator, remove any previously installed Technology Preview versions or the community-supported version of KEDA.
Bug fixes
Previously, the custom-metrics-autoscaler and custom-metrics-autoscaler-adapter images were missing time zone information. As a consequence, scaled objects with cron triggers failed to work because the controllers were unable to find time zone information. With this fix, the image builds are updated to include time zone information. As a result, scaled objects containing cron triggers now function properly. (OCPBUGS-32395)
