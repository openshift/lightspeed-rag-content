Release notes for past releases of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator

The following release notes are for previous versions of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator.

For the current version, see Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator release notes.
Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.12.1-376 release notes
This release of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.12.1-376 provides security updates and bug fixes for running the Operator in an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. The following advisory is available for the RHSA-2024:1812.

Before installing this version of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator, remove any previously installed Technology Preview versions or the community-supported version of KEDA.
Bug fixes
Previously, if invalid values such as nonexistent namespaces were specified in scaled object metadata, the underlying scaler clients would not free, or close, their client descriptors, resulting in a slow memory leak. This fix properly closes the underlying client descriptors when there are errors, preventing memory from leaking. (OCPBUGS-30145)

Previously the ServiceMonitor custom resource (CR) for the keda-metrics-apiserver pod was not functioning, because the CR referenced an incorrect metrics port name of http. This fix corrects the ServiceMonitor CR to reference the proper port name of metrics. As a result, the Service Monitor functions properly. (OCPBUGS-25806)
Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.11.2-322 release notes
This release of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.11.2-322 provides security updates and bug fixes for running the Operator in an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. The following advisory is available for the RHSA-2023:6144.

Before installing this version of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator, remove any previously installed Technology Preview versions or the community-supported version of KEDA.
Bug fixes
Because the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator version 3.11.2-311 was released without a required volume mount in the Operator deployment, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator pod would restart every 15 minutes. This fix adds the required volume mount to the Operator deployment. As a result, the Operator no longer restarts every 15 minutes.  (OCPBUGS-22361)
Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.11.2-311 release notes
This release of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.11.2-311 provides new features and bug fixes for running the Operator in an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. The components of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.11.2-311 were released in RHBA-2023:5981.

Before installing this version of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator, remove any previously installed Technology Preview versions or the community-supported version of KEDA.
New features and enhancements
Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) and OpenShift Dedicated are now supported
The Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.11.2-311 can be installed on OpenShift ROSA and OpenShift Dedicated managed clusters. Previous versions of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator could be installed only in the openshift-keda namespace. This prevented the Operator from being installed on OpenShift ROSA and OpenShift Dedicated clusters. This version of Custom Metrics Autoscaler allows installation to other namespaces such as openshift-operators or keda, enabling installation into ROSA and Dedicated clusters.
Bug fixes
Previously, if the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator was installed and configured, but not in use, the OpenShift CLI reported the couldn't get resource list for external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1: Got empty response for: external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1 error after any oc command was entered. The message, although harmless, could have caused confusion. With this fix, the Got empty response for: external.metrics&#8230;&#8203; error no longer appears inappropriately. (OCPBUGS-15779)

Previously, any annotation or label change to objects managed by the Custom Metrics Autoscaler were reverted by Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator any time the Keda Controller was modified, for example after a configuration change. This caused continuous changing of labels in your objects. The Custom Metrics Autoscaler now uses its own annotation to manage labels and annotations, and annotation or label are no longer inappropriately reverted. (OCPBUGS-15590)
Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.10.1-267 release notes
This release of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.10.1-267 provides new features and bug fixes for running the Operator in an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. The components of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.10.1-267 were released in RHBA-2023:4089.

Before installing this version of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator, remove any previously installed Technology Preview versions or the community-supported version of KEDA.
Bug fixes
Previously, the custom-metrics-autoscaler and custom-metrics-autoscaler-adapter images did not contain time zone information. Because of this, scaled objects with cron triggers failed to work because the controllers were unable to find time zone information. With this fix, the image builds now include time zone information. As a result, scaled objects containing cron triggers now function properly. (OCPBUGS-15264)

Previously, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator would attempt to take ownership of all managed objects, including objects in other namespaces and cluster-scoped objects. Because of this, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator was unable to create the role binding for reading the credentials necessary to be an API server. This caused errors in the kube-system namespace. With this fix, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator skips adding the ownerReference field to any object in another namespace or any cluster-scoped object. As a result, the role binding is now created without any errors. (OCPBUGS-15038)

Previously, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator added an ownerReferences field to the openshift-keda namespace. While this did not cause functionality problems, the presence of this field could have caused confusion for cluster administrators. With this fix, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator does not add the ownerReference field to the openshift-keda namespace. As a result, the openshift-keda namespace no longer has a superfluous ownerReference field. (OCPBUGS-15293)

Previously, if you used a Prometheus trigger configured with authentication method other than pod identity, and the podIdentity parameter was set to none, the trigger would fail to scale. With this fix, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler for OpenShift now properly handles the none pod identity provider type. As a result, a Prometheus trigger configured with authentication method other than pod identity, and the podIdentity parameter sset to none now properly scales. (OCPBUGS-15274)
Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.10.1 release notes
This release of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.10.1 provides new features and bug fixes for running the Operator in an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. The components of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator 2.10.1 were released in RHEA-2023:3199.

Before installing this version of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator, remove any previously installed Technology Preview versions or the community-supported version of KEDA.
New features and enhancements
Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator general availability
The Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator is now generally available as of Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator version 2.10.1.

Scaling by using a scaled job is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
Performance metrics
You can now use the Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) to query metrics on the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator.
Pausing the custom metrics autoscaling for scaled objects
You can now pause the autoscaling of a scaled object, as needed, and resume autoscaling when ready.
Replica fall back for scaled objects
You can now specify the number of replicas to fall back to if a scaled object fails to get metrics from the source.
Customizable HPA naming for scaled objects
You can now specify a custom name for the horizontal pod autoscaler in scaled objects.
Activation and scaling thresholds
Because the horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) cannot scale to or from 0 replicas, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator does that scaling, after which the HPA performs the scaling. You can now specify when the  HPA takes over autoscaling, based on the number of replicas. This allows for more flexibility with your scaling policies.
