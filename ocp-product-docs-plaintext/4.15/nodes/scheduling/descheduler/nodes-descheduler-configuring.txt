Evicting pods using the descheduler

You can run the descheduler in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform by installing the Kube Descheduler Operator and setting the desired profiles and other customizations.
Installing the descheduler
The descheduler is not available by default. To enable the descheduler, you must install the Kube Descheduler Operator from OperatorHub and enable one or more descheduler profiles.

By default, the descheduler runs in predictive mode, which means that it only simulates pod evictions. You must change the mode to automatic for the descheduler to perform the pod evictions.

If you have enabled hosted control planes in your cluster, set a custom priority threshold to lower the chance that pods in the hosted control plane namespaces are evicted. Set the priority threshold class name to hypershift-control-plane, because it has the lowest priority value (100000000) of the hosted control plane priority classes.
