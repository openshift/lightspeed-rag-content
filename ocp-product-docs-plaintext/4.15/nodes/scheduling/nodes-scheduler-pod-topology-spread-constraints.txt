Controlling pod placement by using pod topology spread constraints

You can use pod topology spread constraints to control the placement of your pods across nodes, zones, regions, or other user-defined topology domains.
About pod topology spread constraints
By using a pod topology spread constraint, you provide fine-grained control over the distribution of pods across failure domains to help achieve high availability and more efficient resource utilization.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform administrators can label nodes to provide topology information, such as regions, zones, nodes, or other user-defined domains. After these labels are set on nodes, users can then define pod topology spread constraints to control the placement of pods across these topology domains.

You specify which pods to group together, which topology domains they are spread among, and the acceptable skew. Only pods within the same namespace are matched and grouped together when spreading due to a constraint.
Configuring pod topology spread constraints
The following steps demonstrate how to configure pod topology spread constraints to distribute pods that match the specified labels based on their zone.

You can specify multiple pod topology spread constraints, but you must ensure that they do not conflict with each other. All pod topology spread constraints must be satisfied for a pod to be placed.

A user with the cluster-admin role has added the required labels to nodes.


Create a Pod spec and specify a pod topology spread constraint:

Create the pod:
Example pod topology spread constraints
The following examples demonstrate pod topology spread constraint configurations.

Single pod topology spread constraint example
This example Pod spec defines one pod topology spread constraint. It matches on pods labeled region: us-east, distributes among zones, specifies a skew of 1, and does not schedule the pod if it does not meet these requirements.

kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: my-pod
  labels:
    region: us-east
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsNonRoot: true
    seccompProfile:
      type: RuntimeDefault
  topologySpreadConstraints:
  - maxSkew: 1
    topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
    whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule
    labelSelector:
      matchLabels:
        region: us-east
  containers:
  - image: "docker.io/ocpqe/hello-pod"
    name: hello-pod
    securityContext:
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
      capabilities:
        drop: [ALL]
Multiple pod topology spread constraints example
This example Pod spec defines two pod topology spread constraints. Both match on pods labeled region: us-east, specify a skew of 1, and do not schedule the pod if it does not meet these requirements.

The first constraint distributes pods based on a user-defined label node, and the second constraint distributes pods based on a user-defined label rack. Both constraints must be met for the pod to be scheduled.

kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: my-pod-2
  labels:
    region: us-east
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsNonRoot: true
    seccompProfile:
      type: RuntimeDefault
  topologySpreadConstraints:
  - maxSkew: 1
    topologyKey: node
    whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule
    labelSelector:
      matchLabels:
        region: us-east
  - maxSkew: 1
    topologyKey: rack
    whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule
    labelSelector:
      matchLabels:
        region: us-east
  containers:
  - image: "docker.io/ocpqe/hello-pod"
    name: hello-pod
    securityContext:
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
      capabilities:
        drop: [ALL]
