Copying files to or from an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" container

You can use the CLI to copy local files to or from a remote directory in a container using the rsync command.
Understanding how to copy files
The oc rsync command, or remote sync, is a useful tool for copying database archives to and from your pods for backup and restore purposes. You can also use oc rsync to copy source code changes into a running pod for development debugging, when the running pod supports hot reload of source files.

$ oc rsync <source> <destination> [-c <container>]
Requirements

Specifying the Copy Source
The source argument of the oc rsync command must point to either a local
directory or a pod directory. Individual files are not supported.
Specifying the Copy Destination
The destination argument of the oc rsync command must point to a directory. If
the directory does not exist, but rsync is used for copy, the directory is
created for you.
Deleting Files at the Destination
The --delete flag may be used to delete any files in the remote directory that
are not in the local directory.
Continuous Syncing on File Change
Using the --watch option causes the command to monitor the source path for any
file system changes, and synchronizes changes when they occur. With this
argument, the command runs forever.
Copying files to and from containers
Support for copying local files to or from a container is built into the CLI.

When working with oc rsync, note the following:

rsync must be installed. The oc rsync command uses the local rsync tool, if present on the client
machine and the remote container.

Using advanced Rsync features
The oc rsync command exposes fewer command line options than standard rsync. In the case that you want to use a standard rsync command line option that is not available in oc rsync, for example the --exclude-from=FILE option, it might be possible to use standard rsync 's --rsh (-e) option or RSYNC_RSH environment variable as a workaround, as follows:

$ rsync --rsh='oc rsh' --exclude-from=<file_name> <local-dir> <pod-name>:/<remote-dir>
or:

Export the RSYNC_RSH variable:

$ export RSYNC_RSH='oc rsh'
Then, run the rsync command:

$ rsync --exclude-from=<file_name> <local-dir> <pod-name>:/<remote-dir>
Both of the above examples configure standard rsync to use oc rsh as its remote shell program to enable it to connect to the remote pod, and are an alternative to running oc rsync.
