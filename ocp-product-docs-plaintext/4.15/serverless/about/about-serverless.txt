# OpenShift Serverless overview


OpenShift Serverless provides Kubernetes native building blocks that enable developers to create and deploy serverless, event-driven applications on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. OpenShift Serverless is based on the open source Knative project, which provides portability and consistency for hybrid and multi-cloud environments by enabling an enterprise-grade serverless platform.

[NOTE]
----
Because OpenShift Serverless releases on a different cadence from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, the OpenShift Serverless documentation is now available as separate documentation sets for each minor version of the product.
The OpenShift Serverless documentation is available at https://docs.openshift.com/serverless/.
Documentation for specific versions is available using the version selector drop-down list, or directly by adding the version to the URL, for example, https://docs.openshift.com/serverless/1.28.
In addition, the OpenShift Serverless documentation is also available on the Red Hat Customer Portal at https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_serverless/.
For additional information about the OpenShift Serverless life cycle and supported platforms, refer to the Platform Life Cycle Policy.
