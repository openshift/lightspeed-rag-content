Using taints and tolerations to control logging pod placement

Taints and tolerations allow the node to control which pods should (or should not) be scheduled on them.
Understanding taints and tolerations
A taint allows a node to refuse a pod to be scheduled unless that pod has a matching toleration.

You apply taints to a node through the Node specification (NodeSpec) and apply tolerations to a pod through the Pod specification (PodSpec). When you apply a taint a node, the scheduler cannot place a pod on that node unless the pod can tolerate the taint.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Node
metadata:
  name: my-node
#...
spec:
  taints:
  - effect: NoExecute
    key: key1
    value: value1
#...
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
#...
spec:
  tolerations:
  - key: "key1"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "value1"
    effect: "NoExecute"
    tolerationSeconds: 3600
#...
Taints and tolerations consist of a key, value, and effect.


If you add a NoSchedule taint to a control plane node, the node must have the node-role.kubernetes.io/master=:NoSchedule taint, which is added by default.
A toleration matches a taint:

If the operator parameter is set to Equal:

If the operator parameter is set to Exists:


The following taints are built into "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform":

node.kubernetes.io/not-ready: The node is not ready. This corresponds to the node condition Ready=False.

node.kubernetes.io/unreachable: The node is unreachable from the node controller. This corresponds to the node condition Ready=Unknown.

node.kubernetes.io/memory-pressure: The node has memory pressure issues. This corresponds to the node condition MemoryPressure=True.

node.kubernetes.io/disk-pressure: The node has disk pressure issues. This corresponds to the node condition DiskPressure=True.

node.kubernetes.io/network-unavailable: The node network is unavailable.

node.kubernetes.io/unschedulable: The node is unschedulable.

node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized: When the node controller is started with an external cloud provider, this taint is set on a node to mark it as unusable. After a controller from the cloud-controller-manager initializes this node, the kubelet removes this taint.

node.kubernetes.io/pid-pressure: The node has pid pressure. This corresponds to the node condition PIDPressure=True.
Loki pod placement
You can control which nodes the Loki pods run on, and prevent other workloads from using those nodes, by using tolerations or node selectors on the pods.

You can apply tolerations to the log store pods with the LokiStack custom resource (CR) and apply taints to a node with the node specification. A taint on a node is a key:value pair that instructs the node to repel all pods that do not allow the taint. Using a specific key:value pair that is not on other pods ensures that only the log store pods can run on that node.

apiVersion: loki.grafana.com/v1
kind: LokiStack
metadata:
  name: logging-loki
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
# ...
  template:
    compactor: 1
      nodeSelector:
        node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: "" 2
    distributor:
      nodeSelector:
        node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: ""
    gateway:
      nodeSelector:
        node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: ""
    indexGateway:
      nodeSelector:
        node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: ""

    ruler:
      nodeSelector:
        node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: ""
# ...
Specifies the component pod type that applies to the node selector.

Specifies the pods that are moved to nodes containing the defined label.


In the previous example configuration, all Loki pods are moved to nodes containing the node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: "" label.

To configure the nodeSelector and tolerations fields of the LokiStack (CR), you can use the oc explain command to view the description and fields for a particular resource:

$ oc explain lokistack.spec.template
KIND:     LokiStack
VERSION:  loki.grafana.com/v1

RESOURCE: template <Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     Template defines the resource/limits/tolerations/nodeselectors per
     component

FIELDS:
   compactor	<Object>
     Compactor defines the compaction component spec.

   distributor	<Object>
     Distributor defines the distributor component spec.
...
For more detailed information, you can add a specific field:

$ oc explain lokistack.spec.template.compactor
KIND:     LokiStack
VERSION:  loki.grafana.com/v1

RESOURCE: compactor <Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     Compactor defines the compaction component spec.

FIELDS:
   nodeSelector	<map[string]string>
     NodeSelector defines the labels required by a node to schedule the
     component onto it.

Using tolerations to control log collector pod placement
By default, log collector pods have the following tolerations configuration:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: collector-example
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
# ...
  collection:
    type: vector
    tolerations:
    - effect: NoSchedule
      key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
      operator: Exists
    - effect: NoSchedule
      key: node.kubernetes.io/disk-pressure
      operator: Exists
    - effect: NoExecute
      key: node.kubernetes.io/not-ready
      operator: Exists
    - effect: NoExecute
      key: node.kubernetes.io/unreachable
      operator: Exists
    - effect: NoSchedule
      key: node.kubernetes.io/memory-pressure
      operator: Exists
    - effect: NoSchedule
      key: node.kubernetes.io/pid-pressure
      operator: Exists
    - effect: NoSchedule
      key: node.kubernetes.io/unschedulable
      operator: Exists
# ...
You have installed the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator and OpenShift CLI (oc).


Add a taint to a node where you want logging collector pods to schedule logging collector pods by running the following command:

Edit the collection stanza of the ClusterLogging custom resource (CR) to configure a toleration for the logging collector pods:


This toleration matches the taint created by the oc adm taint command. A pod with this toleration can be scheduled onto node1.
Configuring resources and scheduling for logging collectors
Administrators can modify the resources or scheduling of the collector by creating a ClusterLogging custom resource (CR) that is in the same namespace and has the same name as the ClusterLogForwarder CR that it supports.

The applicable stanzas for the ClusterLogging CR when using multiple log forwarders in a deployment are managementState and collection. All other stanzas are ignored.

You have administrator permissions.

You have installed the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator version 5.8 or newer.

You have created a ClusterLogForwarder CR.


Create a ClusterLogging CR that supports your existing ClusterLogForwarder CR:

Apply the ClusterLogging CR by running the following command:
Viewing logging collector pods
You can view the logging collector pods and the corresponding nodes that they are running on.

Run the following command in a project to view the logging collector pods and their details:
