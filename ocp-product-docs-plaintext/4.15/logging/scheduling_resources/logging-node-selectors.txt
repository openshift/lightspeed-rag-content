Using node selectors to move logging resources

A node selector specifies a map of key/value pairs that are defined using custom labels on nodes and selectors specified in pods.

For the pod to be eligible to run on a node, the pod must have the same key/value node selector as the label on the node.
About node selectors
You can use node selectors on pods and labels on nodes to control where the pod is scheduled. With node selectors, "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" schedules the pods on nodes that contain matching labels.

You can use a node selector to place specific pods on specific nodes, cluster-wide node selectors to place new pods on specific nodes anywhere in the cluster, and project node selectors to place new pods in a project on specific nodes.

For example, as a cluster administrator, you can create an infrastructure where application developers can deploy pods only onto the nodes closest to their geographical location by including a node selector in every pod they create. In this example, the cluster consists of five data centers spread across two regions. In the U.S., label the nodes as us-east, us-central, or us-west. In the Asia-Pacific region (APAC), label the nodes as apac-east or apac-west. The developers can add a node selector to the pods they create to ensure the pods get scheduled on those nodes.

A pod is not scheduled if the Pod object contains a node selector, but no node has a matching label.

If you are using node selectors and node affinity in the same pod configuration, the following rules control pod placement onto nodes:

If you configure both nodeSelector and nodeAffinity, both conditions must be satisfied for the pod to be scheduled onto a candidate node.

If you specify multiple nodeSelectorTerms associated with nodeAffinity types, then the pod can be scheduled onto a node if one of the nodeSelectorTerms is satisfied.

If you specify multiple matchExpressions associated with nodeSelectorTerms, then the pod can be scheduled onto a node only if all matchExpressions are satisfied.

Node selectors on specific pods and nodes

Default cluster-wide node selectors




Project node selectors
Loki pod placement
You can control which nodes the Loki pods run on, and prevent other workloads from using those nodes, by using tolerations or node selectors on the pods.

You can apply tolerations to the log store pods with the LokiStack custom resource (CR) and apply taints to a node with the node specification. A taint on a node is a key:value pair that instructs the node to repel all pods that do not allow the taint. Using a specific key:value pair that is not on other pods ensures that only the log store pods can run on that node.

Specifies the component pod type that applies to the node selector.

Specifies the pods that are moved to nodes containing the defined label.


In the previous example configuration, all Loki pods are moved to nodes containing the node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: "" label.

Configuring resources and scheduling for logging collectors
Administrators can modify the resources or scheduling of the collector by creating a ClusterLogging custom resource (CR) that is in the same namespace and has the same name as the ClusterLogForwarder CR that it supports.

The applicable stanzas for the ClusterLogging CR when using multiple log forwarders in a deployment are managementState and collection. All other stanzas are ignored.

You have administrator permissions.

You have installed the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator version 5.8 or newer.

You have created a ClusterLogForwarder CR.


Create a ClusterLogging CR that supports your existing ClusterLogForwarder CR:

Apply the ClusterLogging CR by running the following command:
Viewing logging collector pods
You can view the logging collector pods and the corresponding nodes that they are running on.

Run the following command in a project to view the logging collector pods and their details:
