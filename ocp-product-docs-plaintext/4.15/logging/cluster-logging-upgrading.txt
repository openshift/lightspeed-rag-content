Updating Logging

There are two types of logging updates: minor release updates (5.y.z) and major release updates (5.y).
Minor release updates
If you installed the logging Operators using the Automatic update approval option, your Operators receive minor version updates automatically. You do not need to complete any manual update steps.

If you installed the logging Operators using the Manual update approval option, you must manually approve minor version updates. For more information, see Manually approving a pending Operator update.
Major release updates
For major version updates you must complete some manual steps.

For major release version compatibility and support information, see OpenShift Operator Life Cycles.
Upgrading the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator to watch all namespaces

You can complete the following procedure to redeploy the Operator without deleting your logging components.

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You have administrator permissions.


Delete the subscription by running the following command:

Delete the Operator group by running the following command:

Delete the cluster service version (CSV) by running the following command:

Redeploy the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator by following the "Installing Logging" documentation.


Check that the targetNamespaces field in the OperatorGroup resource is not present or is set to an empty string.
Updating the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator
To update the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator to a new major release version, you must modify the update channel for the Operator subscription.

You have installed the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator.

You have administrator permissions.

You have access to the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" web console and are viewing the Administrator perspective.


Navigate to Operators -> Installed Operators.

Select the openshift-logging project.

Click the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator.

Click Subscription. In the Subscription details section, click the Update channel link. This link text might be stable or stable-5.y, depending on your current update channel.

In the Change Subscription Update Channel window, select the latest major version update channel, stable-5.y, and click Save. Note the cluster-logging.v5.y.z version.


Wait for a few seconds, then click Operators -> Installed Operators. Verify that the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator version matches the latest cluster-logging.v5.y.z version.

Updating the Loki Operator
To update the Loki Operator to a new major release version, you must modify the update channel for the Operator subscription.

You have installed the Loki Operator.

You have administrator permissions.

Navigate to Operators -> Installed Operators.

Select the openshift-operators-redhat project.

Click the Loki Operator.

Updating the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator
To update the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator to the current version, you must modify the subscription.

The OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator is deprecated and is planned to be removed in a future release. Red Hat provides bug fixes and support for this feature during the current release lifecycle, but this feature no longer receives enhancements. As an alternative to using the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator to manage the default log storage, you can use the Loki Operator.
If you are using Elasticsearch as the default log store, and Kibana as the UI, update the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator before you update the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator.

The Logging status is healthy:

Your Elasticsearch and Kibana data is backed up.

You have administrator permissions.
