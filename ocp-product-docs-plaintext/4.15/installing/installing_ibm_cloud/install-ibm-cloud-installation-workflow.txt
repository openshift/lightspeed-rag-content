Setting up the environment for an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation

Preparing the provisioner node on IBM Cloud(R) Bare Metal (Classic) infrastructure
Perform the following steps to prepare the provisioner node.

Log in to the provisioner node via ssh.

Create a non-root user (kni) and provide that user with sudo privileges:

Create an ssh key for the new user:

Log in as the new user on the provisioner node:

Use Red Hat Subscription Manager to register the provisioner node:

Install the following packages:

Modify the user to add the libvirt group to the newly created user:

Start firewalld:

Enable firewalld:

Start the http service:

Start and enable the libvirtd service:

Set the ID of the provisioner node:

Set the ID of the public subnet:

Set the ID of the private subnet:

Set the provisioner node public IP address:

Set the CIDR for the public network:

Set the IP address and CIDR for the public network:

Set the gateway for the public network:

Set the private IP address of the provisioner node:

Set the CIDR for the private network:

Set the IP address and CIDR for the private network:

Set the gateway for the private network:

Set up the bridges for the baremetal and provisioning networks:

If required, SSH back into the provisioner node:

Verify the connection bridges have been properly created:

Create a pull-secret.txt file:
Configuring the public subnet
All of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster nodes must be on the public subnet. IBM Cloud(R) Bare Metal (Classic) does not provide a DHCP server on the subnet. Set it up separately on the provisioner node.

You must reset the BASH variables defined when preparing the provisioner node. Rebooting the provisioner node after preparing it will delete the BASH variables previously set.

Install dnsmasq:

Open the dnsmasq configuration file:

Add the following configuration to the dnsmasq configuration file:

Obtain the list of hardware for the cluster:

Obtain the MAC addresses and IP addresses for each node:

Add the MAC and IP address pair of the public baremetal network for each node into the dnsmasq.hostsfile file:

Start dnsmasq:

Enable dnsmasq so that it starts when booting the node:

Verify dnsmasq is running:

Open ports 53 and 67 with UDP protocol:

Add provisioning to the external zone with masquerade:

Reload the firewalld configuration:
Retrieving the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installer
Use the stable-4.x version of the installation program and your selected architecture to deploy the generally available stable version of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform:

$ export VERSION=stable-4.15
$ export RELEASE_ARCH=<architecture>
$ export RELEASE_IMAGE=$(curl -s https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/$RELEASE_ARCH/clients/ocp/$VERSION/release.txt | grep 'Pull From: quay.io' | awk -F ' ' '{print $3}')
Extracting the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installer
After retrieving the installer, the next step is to extract it.

Set the environment variables:

Get the oc binary:

Extract the installer:
Configuring the install-config.yaml file
The install-config.yaml file requires some additional details. Most of the information is teaching the installer and the resulting cluster enough about the available IBM Cloud(R) Bare Metal (Classic) hardware so that it is able to fully manage it. The material difference between installing on bare metal and installing on IBM Cloud(R) Bare Metal (Classic) is that you must explicitly set the privilege level for IPMI in the BMC section of the install-config.yaml file.

Configure install-config.yaml. Change the appropriate variables to match the environment, including pullSecret and sshKey.

Create a directory to store the cluster configuration:

Copy the install-config.yaml file into the directory:

Ensure all bare metal nodes are powered off prior to installing the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster:

Remove old bootstrap resources if any are left over from a previous deployment attempt:
Additional install-config parameters
See the following tables for the required parameters, the hosts parameter, and the bmc parameter for the install-config.yaml file.




The hosts parameter is a list of separate bare metal assets used to build the cluster.
Root device hints
The rootDeviceHints parameter enables the installer to provision the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) image to a particular device. The installer examines the devices in the order it discovers them, and compares the discovered values with the hint values. The installer uses the first discovered device that matches the hint value. The configuration can combine multiple hints, but a device must match all hints for the installer to select it.


     - name: master-0
       role: master
       bmc:
         address: ipmi://10.10.0.3:6203
         username: admin
         password: redhat
       bootMACAddress: de:ad:be:ef:00:40
       rootDeviceHints:
         deviceName: "/dev/sda"
Creating the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform manifests
Create the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform manifests.
Deploying the cluster via the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installer
Run the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installer:

$ ./openshift-baremetal-install --dir ~/clusterconfigs --log-level debug create cluster
Following the installation
During the deployment process, you can check the installation's overall status by issuing the tail command to the .openshift_install.log log file in the install directory folder:

$ tail -f /path/to/install-dir/.openshift_install.log
