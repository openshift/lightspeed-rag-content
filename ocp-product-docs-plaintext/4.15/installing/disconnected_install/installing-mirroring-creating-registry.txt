Creating a mirror registry with mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift

The mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift is a small and streamlined container registry that you can use as a target for mirroring the required container images of "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" for disconnected installations.

If you already have a container image registry, such as Red Hat Quay, you can skip this section and go straight to Mirroring the OpenShift Container Platform image repository.
Prerequisites
An "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" subscription.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8 and 9 with Podman 3.4.2 or later and OpenSSL installed.

Fully qualified domain name for the Red Hat Quay service, which must resolve through a DNS server.

Key-based SSH connectivity on the target host. SSH keys are automatically generated for local installs. For remote hosts, you must generate your own SSH keys.

2 or more vCPUs.

8 GB of RAM.

About 12 GB for "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" "4.15" release images, or about 358 GB for "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" "4.15" release images and "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" "4.15" Red Hat Operator images. Up to 1 TB per stream or more is suggested.
Mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift introduction
For disconnected deployments of "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform", a container registry is required to carry out the installation of the clusters. To run a production-grade registry service on such a cluster, you must create a separate registry deployment to install the first cluster. The mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift addresses this need and is included in every OpenShift subscription. It is available for download on the OpenShift console Downloads page.

The mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift allows users to install a small-scale version of Red Hat Quay and its required components using the mirror-registry command line interface (CLI) tool. The mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift is deployed automatically with preconfigured local storage and a local database. It also includes auto-generated user credentials and access permissions with a single set of inputs and no additional configuration choices to get started.

The mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift provides a pre-determined network configuration and reports deployed component credentials and access URLs upon success. A limited set of optional configuration inputs like fully qualified domain name (FQDN) services, superuser name and password, and custom TLS certificates are also provided. This provides users with a container registry so that they can easily create an offline mirror of all "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" release content when running "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" in restricted network environments.

Use of the mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift is optional if another container registry is already available in the install environment.

Mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift limitations
The following limitations apply to the mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift:

The mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift is not a highly-available registry and only local file system storage is supported. It is not intended to replace Red Hat Quay or the internal image registry for "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform".

The mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift is only supported for hosting images that are required to install a disconnected "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster, such as Release images or Red Hat Operator images. It uses local storage on your Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) machine, and storage supported by RHEL is supported by the mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift.

Support for Red Hat product images that are pushed to the mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift for bootstrapping purposes are covered by valid subscriptions for each respective product. A list of exceptions to further enable the bootstrap experience can be found on the Self-managed Red Hat OpenShift sizing and subscription guide.

Content built by customers should not be hosted by the mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift.

Using the mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift with more than one cluster is discouraged because multiple clusters can create a single point of failure when updating your cluster fleet. It is advised to leverage the mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift to install a cluster that can host a production-grade, highly-available registry such as Red Hat Quay, which can serve "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" content to other clusters.
Mirroring on a local host with mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift
This procedure explains how to install the mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift on a local host using the mirror-registry installer tool. By doing so, users can create a local host registry running on port 443 for the purpose of storing a mirror of "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" images.

Installing the mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift using the mirror-registry CLI tool makes several changes to your machine. After installation, a $HOME/quay-install directory is created, which has installation files, local storage, and the configuration bundle. Trusted SSH keys are generated in case the deployment target is the local host, and systemd files on the host machine are set up to ensure that container runtimes are persistent. Additionally, an initial user named init is created with an automatically generated password. All access credentials are printed at the end of the install routine.
Download the mirror-registry.tar.gz package for the latest version of the mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift found on the OpenShift console Downloads page.

Install the mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift on your local host with your current user account by using the mirror-registry tool. For a full list of available flags, see "mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift flags".

Use the user name and password generated during installation to log into the registry by running the following command:

You can mirror "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" images after logging in. Depending on your needs, see either the "Mirroring the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" image repository" or the "Mirroring Operator catalogs for use with disconnected clusters" sections of this document.
