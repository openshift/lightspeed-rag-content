# About disconnected installation mirroring


You can use a mirror registry to ensure that your clusters only use container images that satisfy your organizational controls on external content. Before you install a cluster on infrastructure that you provision in a restricted network, you must mirror the required container images into that environment. To mirror container images, you must have a registry for mirroring.

# Creating a mirror registry

If you already have a container image registry, such as Red Hat Quay, you can use it as your mirror registry. If you do not already have a registry, you can create a mirror registry using the mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift.

# Mirroring images for a disconnected installation

You can use one of the following procedures to mirror your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform image repository to your mirror registry:

* Mirroring images for a disconnected installation
