Preparing for bare metal cluster installation

Prerequisites
You reviewed details about the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation and update processes.

You have read the documentation on selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users.
Planning a bare metal cluster for OpenShift Virtualization
If you will use OpenShift Virtualization, it is important to be aware of several requirements before you install your bare metal cluster.

If you want to use live migration features, you must have multiple worker nodes at the time of cluster installation. This is because live migration requires the cluster-level high availability (HA) flag to be set to true. The HA flag is set when a cluster is installed and cannot be changed afterwards. If there are fewer than two worker nodes defined when you install your cluster, the HA flag is set to false for the life of the cluster.

Live migration requires shared storage. Storage for OpenShift Virtualization must support and use the ReadWriteMany (RWX) access mode.

If you plan to use Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV), ensure that your network interface controllers (NICs) are supported by Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

About Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) hardware networks

Connecting a virtual machine to an SR-IOV network
NIC partitioning for SR-IOV devices (Technology Preview)
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform can be deployed on a server with a dual port network interface card (NIC). You can partition a single, high-speed dual port NIC into multiple virtual functions (VFs) and enable SR-IOV.

This feature supports the use of bonds for high availability with the Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP).

Only one LACP can be declared by physical NIC.
An Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster can be deployed on a bond interface with 2 VFs on 2 physical functions (PFs) using the following methods:

Agent-based installer

Installer-provisioned infrastructure installation

User-provisioned infrastructure installation


Support for Day 1 operations associated with enabling NIC partitioning for SR-IOV devices is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
Example: Bonds and SR-IOV dual-nic node network configuration

Optional: Configuring host network interfaces for dual port NIC

Choosing a method to install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on bare metal
The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program offers four methods for deploying a cluster:

Interactive: You can deploy a cluster with the web-based Assisted Installer. This is the recommended approach for clusters with networks connected to the internet. The Assisted Installer is the easiest way to install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, it provides smart defaults, and it performs pre-flight validations before installing the cluster. It also provides a RESTful API for automation and advanced configuration scenarios.

Local Agent-based: You can deploy a cluster locally with the agent-based installer for air-gapped or restricted networks. It provides many of the benefits of the Assisted Installer, but you must download and configure the agent-based installer first. Configuration is done with a commandline interface. This approach is ideal for air-gapped or restricted networks.

Automated: You can deploy a cluster on installer-provisioned infrastructure and the cluster it maintains. The installer uses each cluster host's baseboard management controller (BMC) for provisioning. You can deploy clusters with both connected or air-gapped or restricted networks.

Full control: You can deploy a cluster on infrastructure that you prepare and maintain, which provides maximum customizability. You can deploy clusters with both connected or air-gapped or restricted networks.


The clusters have the following characteristics:

Highly available infrastructure with no single points of failure is available by default.

Administrators maintain control over what updates are applied and when.


See Installation process for more information about installer-provisioned and user-provisioned installation processes.

Installing a cluster on installer-provisioned infrastructure
You can install a cluster on bare metal infrastructure that is provisioned by the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program, by using the following method:

Installing an installer-provisioned cluster on bare metal: You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on bare metal by using installer provisioning.
Installing a cluster on user-provisioned infrastructure
You can install a cluster on bare metal infrastructure that you provision, by using one of the following methods:

Installing a user-provisioned cluster on bare metal: You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on bare metal infrastructure that you provision. For a cluster that contains user-provisioned infrastructure, you must deploy all of the required machines.

Installing a user-provisioned bare metal cluster with network customizations: You can install a bare metal cluster on user-provisioned infrastructure with network-customizations. By customizing your network configuration, your cluster can coexist with existing IP address allocations in your environment and integrate with existing MTU and VXLAN configurations. Most of the network customizations must be applied at the installation stage.

Installing a user-provisioned bare metal cluster on a restricted network: You can install a user-provisioned bare metal cluster on a restricted or disconnected network by using a mirror registry. You can also use this installation method to ensure that your clusters only use container images that satisfy your organizational controls on external content.
