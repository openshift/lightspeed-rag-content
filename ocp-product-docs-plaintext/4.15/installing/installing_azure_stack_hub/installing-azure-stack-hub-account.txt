# Configuring an Azure Stack Hub account


Before you can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, you must configure a Microsoft Azure account.

[IMPORTANT]
----
All Azure resources that are available through public endpoints are subject to resource name restrictions, and you cannot create resources that use certain terms. For a list of terms that Azure restricts, see Resolve reserved resource name errors in the Azure documentation.

# Azure Stack Hub account limits

The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster uses a number of Microsoft Azure Stack Hub components, and the default Quota types in Azure Stack Hub affect your ability to install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters.

The following table summarizes the {cp} components whose limits can impact your
ability to install and run Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters.

# Configuring a DNS zone in Azure Stack Hub

To successfully install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on Azure Stack Hub, you must create DNS records in an Azure Stack Hub DNS zone. The DNS zone must be authoritative for the domain. To delegate a registrar&#8217;s DNS zone to Azure Stack Hub, see Microsoft&#8217;s documentation for Azure Stack Hub datacenter DNS integration.

# Required Azure Stack Hub roles

Your Microsoft Azure Stack Hub account must have the following roles for the subscription that you use:

* Owner

To set roles on the Azure portal, see the Manage access to resources in Azure Stack Hub with role-based access control in the Microsoft documentation.

# Creating a service principal

Because Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and its installation program create Microsoft Azure resources by using the Azure Resource Manager, you must create a service principal to represent it.

* Install or update the Azure CLI.
* Your Azure account has the required roles for the subscription that you use.

1. Register your environment:

```terminal
$ az cloud register -n AzureStackCloud --endpoint-resource-manager <endpoint> 1
```

Specify the Azure Resource Manager endpoint, `https://management.<region>.<fqdn>/`.

See the Microsoft documentation for details.
2. Set the active environment:

```terminal
$ az cloud set -n AzureStackCloud
```

3. Update your environment configuration to use the specific API version for Azure Stack Hub:

```terminal
$ az cloud update --profile 2019-03-01-hybrid
```

4. Log in to the Azure CLI:

```terminal
$ az login
```


If you are in a multitenant environment, you must also supply the tenant ID.
5. If your Azure account uses subscriptions, ensure that you are using the right
subscription:
1. View the list of available accounts and record the tenantId value for the
subscription you want to use for your cluster:

```terminal
$ az account list --refresh
```

Example output

```terminal
[
  {
    "cloudName": AzureStackCloud",
    "id": "9bab1460-96d5-40b3-a78e-17b15e978a80",
    "isDefault": true,
    "name": "Subscription Name",
    "state": "Enabled",
    "tenantId": "6057c7e9-b3ae-489d-a54e-de3f6bf6a8ee",
    "user": {
      "name": "you@example.com",
      "type": "user"
    }
  }
]
```

2. View your active account details and confirm that the tenantId value matches
the subscription you want to use:

```terminal
$ az account show
```

Example output

```terminal
{
  "environmentName": AzureStackCloud",
  "id": "9bab1460-96d5-40b3-a78e-17b15e978a80",
  "isDefault": true,
  "name": "Subscription Name",
  "state": "Enabled",
  "tenantId": "6057c7e9-b3ae-489d-a54e-de3f6bf6a8ee", 1
  "user": {
    "name": "you@example.com",
    "type": "user"
  }
}
```

Ensure that the value of the tenantId parameter is the correct subscription ID.
3. If you are not using the right subscription, change the active subscription:

```terminal
$ az account set -s <subscription_id> 1
```

Specify the subscription ID.
4. Verify the subscription ID update:

```terminal
$ az account show
```

Example output

```terminal
{
  "environmentName": AzureStackCloud",
  "id": "33212d16-bdf6-45cb-b038-f6565b61edda",
  "isDefault": true,
  "name": "Subscription Name",
  "state": "Enabled",
  "tenantId": "8049c7e9-c3de-762d-a54e-dc3f6be6a7ee",
  "user": {
    "name": "you@example.com",
    "type": "user"
  }
}
```

6. Record the tenantId and id parameter values from the output. You need these values during the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation.
7. Create the service principal for your account:

```terminal
$ az ad sp create-for-rbac --role Contributor --name <service_principal> \ 1
  --scopes /subscriptions/<subscription_id> 2
  --years <years> 3
```

Specify the service principal name.
Specify the subscription ID.
Specify the number of years. By default, a service principal expires in one year. By using the --years option you can extend the validity of your service principal.
Example output

```terminal
Creating 'Contributor' role assignment under scope '/subscriptions/<subscription_id>'
The output includes credentials that you must protect. Be sure that you do not
include these credentials in your code or check the credentials into your source
control. For more information, see https://aka.ms/azadsp-cli
{
  "appId": "ac461d78-bf4b-4387-ad16-7e32e328aec6",
  "displayName": <service_principal>",
  "password": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "tenantId": "8049c7e9-c3de-762d-a54e-dc3f6be6a7ee"
}
```

8. Record the values of the appId and password parameters from the previous
output. You need these values during Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation.
