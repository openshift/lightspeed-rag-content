Configuring an Azure Stack Hub account

Before you can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, you must configure a Microsoft Azure account.

All Azure resources that are available through public endpoints are subject to resource name restrictions, and you cannot create resources that use certain terms. For a list of terms that Azure restricts, see Resolve reserved resource name errors in the Azure documentation.
Azure Stack Hub account limits
The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster uses a number of Microsoft Azure Stack Hub components, and the default Quota types in Azure Stack Hub affect your ability to install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters.

The following table summarizes the Azure Stack Hub components whose limits can impact your ability to install and run Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters.


Optimizing storage.
Configuring a DNS zone in Azure Stack Hub
To successfully install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on Azure Stack Hub, you must create DNS records in an Azure Stack Hub DNS zone. The DNS zone must be authoritative for the domain. To delegate a registrar's DNS zone to Azure Stack Hub, see Microsoft's documentation for Azure Stack Hub datacenter DNS integration.
Required Azure Stack Hub roles
Your Microsoft Azure Stack Hub account must have the following roles for the subscription that you use:

Owner


To set roles on the Azure portal, see the Manage access to resources in Azure Stack Hub with role-based access control in the Microsoft documentation.
Creating a service principal
Because Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and its installation program create Microsoft Azure resources by using the Azure Resource Manager, you must create a service principal to represent it.

Install or update the Azure CLI.

Your Azure account has the required roles for the subscription that you use.


Register your environment:

Set the active environment:

Update your environment configuration to use the specific API version for Azure Stack Hub:

Log in to the Azure CLI:

If your Azure account uses subscriptions, ensure that you are using the right
subscription:

Record the tenantId and id parameter values from the output. You need these values during the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation.

Create the service principal for your account:

Record the values of the appId and password parameters from the previous
output. You need these values during Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation.
