Preparing to install on IBM Cloud

The installation workflows documented in this section are for IBM Cloud(R) infrastructure environments. IBM Cloud(R) classic is not supported at this time. For more information about the difference between classic and VPC infrastructures, see the IBM(R) documentation.
Prerequisites
You reviewed details about the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation and update processes.

You read the documentation on selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users.
Requirements for installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on IBM Cloud
Before installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on IBM Cloud(R), you must create a service account and configure an IBM Cloud(R) account. See Configuring an IBM Cloud(R) account for details about creating an account, enabling API services, configuring DNS, IBM Cloud(R) account limits, and supported IBM Cloud(R) regions.

You must manually manage your cloud credentials when installing a cluster to IBM Cloud(R). Do this by configuring the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) for manual mode before you install the cluster. For more information, see Configuring IAM for IBM Cloud(R).
Choosing a method to install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on IBM Cloud
You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on IBM Cloud(R) using installer-provisioned infrastructure. This process involves using an installation program to provision the underlying infrastructure for your cluster. Installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on IBM Cloud(R) using user-provisioned infrastructure is not supported at this time.

See Installation process for more information about installer-provisioned installation processes.

Installing a cluster on installer-provisioned infrastructure
You can install a cluster on IBM Cloud(R) infrastructure that is provisioned by the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program by using one of the following methods:

Installing a customized cluster on IBM Cloud(R): You can install a customized cluster on IBM Cloud(R) infrastructure that the installation program provisions. The installation program allows for some customization to be applied at the installation stage. Many other customization options are available post-installation.

Installing a cluster on IBM Cloud(R) with network customizations: You can customize your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform network configuration during installation, so that your cluster can coexist with your existing IP address allocations and adhere to your network requirements.

Installing a cluster on IBM Cloud(R) into an existing VPC: You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on an existing IBM Cloud(R). You can use this installation method if you have constraints set by the guidelines of your company, such as limits when creating new accounts or infrastructure.

Installing a private cluster on an existing VPC: You can install a private cluster on an existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). You can use this method to deploy Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on an internal network that is not visible to the internet.

Installing a cluster on IBM Cloud VPC in a restricted network: You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on IBM Cloud VPC on installer-provisioned infrastructure by using an internal mirror of the installation release content. You can use this method to install a cluster that does not require an active internet connection to obtain the software components.
