Installing a cluster with RHEL KVM on IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE in a restricted network

In "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" version "4.15", you can install a cluster on IBM Z&#174; or IBM&#174; LinuxONE infrastructure that you provision in a restricted network.

While this document refers to only IBM Z&#174;, all information in it also applies to IBM&#174; LinuxONE.
Additional considerations exist for non-bare metal platforms. Review the information in the guidelines for deploying "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" on non-tested platforms before you install an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster.
Prerequisites
You reviewed details about the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation and update processes.

You read the documentation on selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users.

You created a registry on your mirror host and obtained the imageContentSources data for your version of "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform".

You must move or remove any existing installation files, before you begin the installation process. This ensures that the required installation files are created and updated during the installation process.

You provisioned persistent storage using OpenShift Data Foundation or other supported storage protocols for your cluster. To deploy a private image registry, you must set up persistent storage with ReadWriteMany access.

If you use a firewall, you configured it to allow the sites that your cluster requires access to.

You provisioned a RHEL Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) system that is hosted on the logical partition (LPAR) and based on RHEL 8.6 or later. See Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9 Life Cycle.
About installations in restricted networks
In "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" "4.15", you can perform an installation that does not require an active connection to the internet to obtain software components. Restricted network installations can be completed using installer-provisioned infrastructure or user-provisioned infrastructure, depending on the cloud platform to which you are installing the cluster.

If you choose to perform a restricted network installation on a cloud platform, you still require access to its cloud APIs. Some cloud functions, like Amazon Web Service's Route 53 DNS and IAM services, require internet access. Depending on your network, you might require less internet access for an installation on bare metal hardware, Nutanix, or on VMware vSphere.

To complete a restricted network installation, you must create a registry that mirrors the contents of the OpenShift image registry and contains the installation media. You can create this registry on a mirror host, which can access both the internet and your closed network, or by using other methods that meet your restrictions.

Because of the complexity of the configuration for user-provisioned installations, consider completing a standard user-provisioned infrastructure installation before you attempt a restricted network installation using user-provisioned infrastructure. Completing this test installation might make it easier to isolate and troubleshoot any issues that might arise during your installation in a restricted network.
Additional limits
Clusters in restricted networks have the following additional limitations and restrictions:

The ClusterVersion status includes an Unable to retrieve available updates
error.

By default, you cannot use the contents of the Developer Catalog because
you cannot access the required image stream tags.
Internet access for "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform"
In "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" "4.15", you require access to the internet to obtain the images that are necessary to install your cluster.

You must have internet access to:

Access OpenShift Cluster Manager to download the installation program and perform subscription management. If the cluster has internet access and you do not disable Telemetry, that service automatically entitles your cluster.

Access Quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install your cluster.

Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.
Machine requirements for a cluster with user-provisioned infrastructure
For a cluster that contains user-provisioned infrastructure, you must deploy all of the required machines.

One or more KVM host machines based on RHEL 8.6 or later. Each RHEL KVM host machine must have libvirt installed and running. The virtual machines are provisioned under each RHEL KVM host machine.

Required machines
The smallest "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" clusters require the following hosts:


To improve high availability of your cluster, distribute the control plane machines over different RHEL instances on at least two physical machines.
The bootstrap, control plane, and compute machines must use Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) as the operating system.

See Red Hat Enterprise Linux technology capabilities and limits.
Network connectivity requirements
The "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installer creates the Ignition files, which are necessary for all the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) virtual machines. The automated installation of "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" is performed by the bootstrap machine. It starts the installation of "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" on each node, starts the Kubernetes cluster, and then finishes. During this bootstrap, the virtual machine must have an established network connection either through a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server or static IP address.
IBM Z network connectivity requirements
To install on IBM Z&#174; under RHEL KVM, you need:

A RHEL KVM host configured with an OSA or RoCE network adapter.

Either a RHEL KVM host that is configured to use bridged networking in libvirt or MacVTap to connect the network to the guests.
Host machine resource requirements
The RHEL KVM host in your environment must meet the following requirements to host the virtual machines that you plan for the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" environment. See Getting started with virtualization.

You can install "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" version "4.15" on the following IBM&#174; hardware:

IBM&#174; z16 (all models), IBM&#174; z15 (all models), IBM&#174; z14 (all models)

IBM&#174; LinuxONE 4 (all models), IBM&#174; LinuxONE III (all models), IBM&#174; LinuxONE Emperor II, IBM&#174; LinuxONE Rockhopper II
Minimum IBM Z system environment

The equivalent of six Integrated Facilities for Linux (IFL), which are SMT2 enabled, for each cluster.

At least one network connection to both connect to the LoadBalancer service and to serve data for traffic outside the cluster.


You can use dedicated or shared IFLs to assign sufficient compute resources. Resource sharing is one of the key strengths of IBM Z&#174;. However, you must adjust capacity correctly on each hypervisor layer and ensure sufficient resources for every "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster.
Since the overall performance of the cluster can be impacted, the LPARs that are used to set up the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" clusters must provide sufficient compute capacity. In this context, LPAR weight management, entitlements, and CPU shares on the hypervisor level play an important role.

One LPAR running on RHEL 8.6 or later with KVM, which is managed by libvirt


On your RHEL KVM host, set up:

Three guest virtual machines for "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" control plane machines

Two guest virtual machines for "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" compute machines

One guest virtual machine for the temporary "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" bootstrap machine
Minimum resource requirements
Each cluster virtual machine must meet the following minimum requirements:


One physical core (IFL) provides two logical cores (threads) when SMT-2 is enabled. The hypervisor can provide two or more vCPUs.
Preferred IBM Z system environment

Three LPARS that each have the equivalent of six IFLs, which are SMT2 enabled, for each cluster.

Two network connections to both connect to the LoadBalancer service and to serve data for traffic outside the cluster.



For high availability, two or three LPARs running on RHEL 8.6 or later with KVM, which are managed by libvirt.


On your RHEL KVM host, set up:

Three guest virtual machines for "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" control plane machines, distributed across the RHEL KVM host machines.

At least six guest virtual machines for "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" compute machines, distributed across the RHEL KVM host machines.

One guest virtual machine for the temporary "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" bootstrap machine.

To ensure the availability of integral components in an overcommitted environment, increase the priority of the control plane by using cpu_shares. Do the same for infrastructure nodes, if they exist. See schedinfo in IBM&#174; Documentation.
Preferred resource requirements
The preferred requirements for each cluster virtual machine are:
Certificate signing requests management
Because your cluster has limited access to automatic machine management when you use infrastructure that you provision, you must provide a mechanism for approving cluster certificate signing requests (CSRs) after installation. The kube-controller-manager only approves the kubelet client CSRs. The machine-approver cannot guarantee the validity of a serving certificate that is requested by using kubelet credentials because it cannot confirm that the correct machine issued the request. You must determine and implement a method of verifying the validity of the kubelet serving certificate requests and approving them.

Recommended host practices for IBM Z&#174; & IBM&#174; LinuxONE environments
Networking requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure
All the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines require networking to be configured in initramfs during boot to fetch their Ignition config files.

During the initial boot, the machines require an IP address configuration that is set either through a DHCP server or statically by providing the required boot options. After a network connection is established, the machines download their Ignition config files from an HTTP or HTTPS server. The Ignition config files are then used to set the exact state of each machine. The Machine Config Operator completes more changes to the machines, such as the application of new certificates or keys, after installation.

It is recommended to use a DHCP server for long-term management of the cluster machines. Ensure that the DHCP server is configured to provide persistent IP addresses, DNS server information, and hostnames to the cluster machines.

If a DHCP service is not available for your user-provisioned infrastructure, you can instead provide the IP networking configuration and the address of the DNS server to the nodes at RHCOS install time. These can be passed as boot arguments if you are installing from an ISO image. See the Installing RHCOS and starting the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" bootstrap process section for more information about static IP provisioning and advanced networking options.
The Kubernetes API server must be able to resolve the node names of the cluster machines. If the API servers and worker nodes are in different zones, you can configure a default DNS search zone to allow the API server to resolve the node names. Another supported approach is to always refer to hosts by their fully-qualified domain names in both the node objects and all DNS requests.

Setting the cluster node hostnames through DHCP
On Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines, the hostname is set through NetworkManager. By default, the machines obtain their hostname through DHCP. If the hostname is not provided by DHCP, set statically through kernel arguments, or another method, it is obtained through a reverse DNS lookup. Reverse DNS lookup occurs after the network has been initialized on a node and can take time to resolve. Other system services can start prior to this and detect the hostname as localhost or similar. You can avoid this by using DHCP to provide the hostname for each cluster node.

Additionally, setting the hostnames through DHCP can bypass any manual DNS record name configuration errors in environments that have a DNS split-horizon implementation.
Network connectivity requirements
You must configure the network connectivity between machines to allow "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster components to communicate. Each machine must be able to resolve the hostnames of all other machines in the cluster.

This section provides details about the ports that are required.





"Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" clusters are configured to use a public Network Time Protocol (NTP) server by default. If you want to use a local enterprise NTP server, or if your cluster is being deployed in a disconnected network, you can configure the cluster to use a specific time server. For more information, see the documentation for Configuring chrony time service.

If a DHCP server provides NTP server information, the chrony time service on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines read the information and can sync the clock with the NTP servers.

Configuring chrony time service
User-provisioned DNS requirements
In "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" deployments, DNS name resolution is required for the following components:

The Kubernetes API

The "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" application wildcard

The bootstrap, control plane, and compute machines


Reverse DNS resolution is also required for the Kubernetes API, the bootstrap machine, the control plane machines, and the compute machines.

DNS A/AAAA or CNAME records are used for name resolution and PTR records are used for reverse name resolution. The reverse records are important because Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) uses the reverse records to set the hostnames for all the nodes, unless the hostnames are provided by DHCP. Additionally, the reverse records are used to generate the certificate signing requests (CSR) that "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" needs to operate.

The following DNS records are required for a user-provisioned "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster and they must be in place before installation. In each record, <cluster_name> is the cluster name and <base_domain> is the base domain that you specify in the install-config.yaml file. A complete DNS record takes the form: <component>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>..


In "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" 4.4 and later, you do not need to specify etcd host and SRV records in your DNS configuration.
You can use the dig command to verify name and reverse name resolution. See the section on Validating DNS resolution for user-provisioned infrastructure for detailed validation steps.
Example DNS configuration for user-provisioned clusters
This section provides A and PTR record configuration samples that meet the DNS requirements for deploying "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" on user-provisioned infrastructure. The samples are not meant to provide advice for choosing one DNS solution over another.

In the examples, the cluster name is ocp4 and the base domain is example.com.

The following example is a BIND zone file that shows sample A records for name resolution in a user-provisioned cluster.

Load balancing requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure
Before you install "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform", you must provision the API and application Ingress load balancing infrastructure. In production scenarios, you can deploy the API and application Ingress load balancers separately so that you can scale the load balancer infrastructure for each in isolation.

If you want to deploy the API and application Ingress load balancers with a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) instance, you must purchase the RHEL subscription separately.
The load balancing infrastructure must meet the following requirements:

API load balancer: Provides a common endpoint for users, both human and machine, to interact with and configure the platform. Configure the following conditions:

Application Ingress load balancer: Provides an ingress point for application traffic flowing in from outside the cluster. A working configuration for the Ingress router is required for an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster.


Example load balancer configuration for user-provisioned clusters
This section provides an example API and application Ingress load balancer configuration that meets the load balancing requirements for user-provisioned clusters. The sample is an /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg configuration for an HAProxy load balancer. The example is not meant to provide advice for choosing one load balancing solution over another.

In the example, the same load balancer is used for the Kubernetes API and application ingress traffic. In production scenarios, you can deploy the API and application ingress load balancers separately so that you can scale the load balancer infrastructure for each in isolation.

If you are using HAProxy as a load balancer and SELinux is set to enforcing, you must ensure that the HAProxy service can bind to the configured TCP port by running setsebool -P haproxy_connect_any=1.

Port 6443 handles the Kubernetes API traffic and points to the control plane machines.

The bootstrap entries must be in place before the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster installation and they must be removed after the bootstrap process is complete.

Port 22623 handles the machine config server traffic and points to the control plane machines.

Port 443 handles the HTTPS traffic and points to the machines that run the Ingress Controller pods. The Ingress Controller pods run on the compute machines by default.

Port 80 handles the HTTP traffic and points to the machines that run the Ingress Controller pods. The Ingress Controller pods run on the compute machines by default.
If you are using HAProxy as a load balancer, you can check that the haproxy process is listening on ports 6443, 22623, 443, and 80 by running netstat -nltupe on the HAProxy node.
Preparing the user-provisioned infrastructure
Before you install "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" on user-provisioned infrastructure, you must prepare the underlying infrastructure.

This section provides details about the high-level steps required to set up your cluster infrastructure in preparation for an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation. This includes configuring IP networking and network connectivity for your cluster nodes, enabling the required ports through your firewall, and setting up the required DNS and load balancing infrastructure.

After preparation, your cluster infrastructure must meet the requirements outlined in the Requirements for a cluster with user-provisioned infrastructure section.

You have reviewed the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" 4.x Tested Integrations page.

You have reviewed the infrastructure requirements detailed in the Requirements for a cluster with user-provisioned infrastructure section.


If you are using DHCP to provide the IP networking configuration to your cluster nodes, configure your DHCP service.

Choose to perform either a fast track installation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) or a full installation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS). For the full installation, you must set up an HTTP or HTTPS server to provide Ignition files and install images to the cluster nodes. For the fast track installation an HTTP or HTTPS server is not required, however, a DHCP server is required. See sections “Fast-track installation: Creating Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines" and “Full installation: Creating Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines".

Ensure that your network infrastructure provides the required network connectivity between the cluster components. See the Networking requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure section for details about the requirements.

Configure your firewall to enable the ports required for the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster components to communicate. See Networking requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure section for details about the ports that are required.

Setup the required DNS infrastructure for your cluster.

Validate your DNS configuration.

Provision the required API and application ingress load balancing infrastructure. See the Load balancing requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure section for more information about the requirements.


Some load balancing solutions require the DNS name resolution for the cluster nodes to be in place before the load balancing is initialized.
Validating DNS resolution for user-provisioned infrastructure
You can validate your DNS configuration before installing "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" on user-provisioned infrastructure.

The validation steps detailed in this section must succeed before you install your cluster.
You have configured the required DNS records for your user-provisioned infrastructure.


From your installation node, run DNS lookups against the record names of the Kubernetes API, the wildcard routes, and the cluster nodes. Validate that the IP addresses contained in the responses correspond to the correct components.

From your installation node, run reverse DNS lookups against the IP addresses of the load balancer and the cluster nodes. Validate that the record names contained in the responses correspond to the correct components.
Generating a key pair for cluster node SSH access
During an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation, you can provide an SSH public key to the installation program. The key is passed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) nodes through their Ignition config files and is used to authenticate SSH access to the nodes. The key is added to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys list for the core user on each node, which enables password-less authentication.

After the key is passed to the nodes, you can use the key pair to SSH in to the RHCOS nodes as the user core. To access the nodes through SSH, the private key identity must be managed by SSH for your local user.

If you want to SSH in to your cluster nodes to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, you must provide the SSH public key during the installation process. The ./openshift-install gather command also requires the SSH public key to be in place on the cluster nodes.

Do not skip this procedure in production environments, where disaster recovery and debugging is required.
If you do not have an existing SSH key pair on your local machine to use for authentication onto your cluster nodes, create one. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

View the public SSH key:

Add the SSH private key identity to the SSH agent for your local user, if it has not already been added. SSH agent management of the key is required for password-less SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes, or if you want to use the ./openshift-install gather command.

Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent:


When you install "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform", provide the SSH public key to the installation program.
Manually creating the installation configuration file
Installing the cluster requires that you manually create the installation configuration file.

You have an SSH public key on your local machine to provide to the installation program. The key will be used for SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes for debugging and disaster recovery.

You have obtained the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation program and the pull secret for your
cluster.


Create an installation directory to store your required installation assets in:

Customize the sample install-config.yaml file template that is provided and save
it in the <installation_directory>.

Back up the install-config.yaml file so that you can use it to install multiple clusters.

The base domain of the cluster. All DNS records must be sub-domains of this base and include the cluster name.

The controlPlane section is a single mapping, but the compute section is a sequence of mappings. To meet the requirements of the different data structures, the first line of the compute section must begin with a hyphen, -, and the first line of the controlPlane section must not. Only one control plane pool is used.

Specifies whether to enable or disable simultaneous multithreading (SMT), or hyperthreading. By default, SMT is enabled to increase the performance of the cores in your machines. You can disable it by setting the parameter value to Disabled. If you disable SMT, you must disable it in all cluster machines; this includes both control plane and compute machines.

You must set this value to 0 when you install "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" on user-provisioned infrastructure. In installer-provisioned installations, the parameter controls the number of compute machines that the cluster creates and manages for you. In user-provisioned installations, you must manually deploy the compute machines before you finish installing the cluster.

The number of control plane machines that you add to the cluster. Because the cluster uses these values as the number of etcd endpoints in the cluster, the value must match the number of control plane machines that you deploy.

The cluster name that you specified in your DNS records.

A block of IP addresses from which pod IP addresses are allocated. This block must not overlap with existing physical networks. These IP addresses are used for the pod network. If you need to access the pods from an external network, you must configure load balancers and routers to manage the traffic.

The subnet prefix length to assign to each individual node. For example, if hostPrefix is set to 23, then each node is assigned a /23 subnet out of the given cidr, which allows for 510 (2^(32 - 23) - 2) pod IP addresses. If you are required to provide access to nodes from an external network, configure load balancers and routers to manage the traffic.

The cluster network plugin to install. The default value OVNKubernetes is the only supported value.

The IP address pool to use for service IP addresses. You can enter only one IP address pool. This block must not overlap with existing physical networks. If you need to access the services from an external network, configure load balancers and routers to manage the traffic.

You must set the platform to none. You cannot provide additional platform configuration variables for
IBM Z&#174; infrastructure.

Whether to enable or disable FIPS mode. By default, FIPS mode is not enabled. If FIPS mode is enabled, the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines that "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" runs on bypass the default Kubernetes cryptography suite and use the cryptography modules that are provided with RHCOS instead.

For <local_registry>, specify the registry domain name, and optionally the port, that your mirror registry uses to serve content. For example, registry.example.com or registry.example.com:5000. For <credentials>, specify the base64-encoded user name and password for your mirror registry.

The SSH public key for the core user in Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS).

Add the additionalTrustBundle parameter and value. The value must be the contents of the certificate file that you used for your mirror registry. The certificate file can be an existing, trusted certificate authority or the self-signed certificate that you generated for the mirror registry.

Provide the imageContentSources section according to the output of the command that you used to mirror the repository.
Configuring the cluster-wide proxy during installation
Production environments can deny direct access to the internet and instead have an HTTP or HTTPS proxy available. You can configure a new "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster to use a proxy by configuring the proxy settings in the install-config.yaml file.

You have an existing install-config.yaml file.

You reviewed the sites that your cluster requires access to and determined whether any of them need to bypass the proxy. By default, all cluster egress traffic is proxied, including calls to hosting cloud provider APIs. You added sites to the Proxy object's spec.noProxy field to bypass the proxy if necessary.


Edit your install-config.yaml file and add the proxy settings. For example:

Save the file and reference it when installing "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform".


The installation program creates a cluster-wide proxy that is named cluster that uses the proxy settings in the provided install-config.yaml file. If no proxy settings are provided, a cluster Proxy object is still created, but it will have a nil spec.

Only the Proxy object named cluster is supported, and no additional proxies can be created.
Configuring a three-node cluster
Optionally, you can deploy zero compute machines in a minimal three node cluster that consists of three control plane machines only. This provides smaller, more resource efficient clusters for cluster administrators and developers to use for testing, development, and production.

In three-node "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" environments, the three control plane machines are schedulable, which means that your application workloads are scheduled to run on them.

You have an existing install-config.yaml file.


Ensure that the number of compute replicas is set to 0 in your install-config.yaml file, as shown in the following compute stanza:


For three-node cluster installations, follow these next steps:

If you are deploying a three-node cluster with zero compute nodes, the Ingress Controller pods run on the control plane nodes. In three-node cluster deployments, you must configure your application ingress load balancer to route HTTP and HTTPS traffic to the control plane nodes. See the Load balancing requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure section for more information.

When you create the Kubernetes manifest files in the following procedure, ensure that the mastersSchedulable parameter in the <installation_directory>/manifests/cluster-scheduler-02-config.yml file is set to true. This enables your application workloads to run on the control plane nodes.

Do not deploy any compute nodes when you create the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines.
Cluster Network Operator configuration
The configuration for the cluster network is specified as part of the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) configuration and stored in a custom resource (CR) object that is named cluster. The CR specifies the fields for the Network API in the operator.openshift.io API group.

The CNO configuration inherits the following fields during cluster installation from the Network API in the Network.config.openshift.io API group:


clusterNetwork
IP address pools from which pod IP addresses are allocated.
serviceNetwork
IP address pool for services.
defaultNetwork.type
Cluster network plugin. OVNKubernetes is the only supported plugin during installation.


You can specify the cluster network plugin configuration for your cluster by setting the fields for the defaultNetwork object in the CNO object named cluster.

Cluster Network Operator configuration object
The fields for the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) are described in the following table:



The values for the defaultNetwork object are defined in the following table:



The following table describes the configuration fields for the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin:





defaultNetwork:
  type: OVNKubernetes
  ovnKubernetesConfig:
    mtu: 1400
    genevePort: 6081
      ipsecConfig:
        mode: Full
Using OVNKubernetes can lead to a stack exhaustion problem on IBM Power&#174;.

The values for the kubeProxyConfig object are defined in the following table:
Creating the Kubernetes manifest and Ignition config files
Because you must modify some cluster definition files and manually start the cluster machines, you must generate the Kubernetes manifest and Ignition config files that the cluster needs to configure the machines.

The installation configuration file transforms into the Kubernetes manifests. The manifests wrap into the Ignition configuration files, which are later used to configure the cluster machines.

The Ignition config files that the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending node-bootstrapper certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for Recovering from expired control plane certificates for more information.

It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.
The installation program that generates the manifest and Ignition files is architecture specific and can be obtained from the client image mirror. The Linux version of the installation program runs on s390x only. This installer program is also available as a Mac OS version.
You obtained the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation program.
For a restricted network installation, these files are on your mirror host.

You created the install-config.yaml installation configuration file.


Change to the directory that contains the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation program and generate the Kubernetes manifests for the cluster:

Check that the mastersSchedulable parameter in the <installation_directory>/manifests/cluster-scheduler-02-config.yml Kubernetes manifest file is set to false. This setting prevents pods from being scheduled on the control plane machines:

To create the Ignition configuration files, run the following command from the directory that contains the installation program:
Installing RHCOS and starting the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" bootstrap process
To install "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" on IBM Z&#174; infrastructure that you provision, you must install Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) guest virtual machines. When you install RHCOS, you must provide the Ignition config file that was generated by the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation program for the type of machine you are installing. If you have configured suitable networking, DNS, and load balancing infrastructure, the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" bootstrap process begins automatically after the RHCOS machines have rebooted.

You can perform a fast-track installation of RHCOS that uses a prepackaged QEMU copy-on-write (QCOW2) disk image. Alternatively, you can perform a full installation on a new QCOW2 disk image.

To add further security to your system, you can optionally install RHCOS using IBM&#174; Secure Execution before proceeding to the fast-track installation.

Installing RHCOS using IBM Secure Execution
Before you install RHCOS using IBM&#174; Secure Execution, you must prepare the underlying infrastructure.

IBM&#174; z15 or later, or IBM&#174; LinuxONE III or later.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8 or later.

You have a bootstrap Ignition file. The file is not protected, enabling others to view and edit it.

You have verified that the boot image has not been altered after installation.

You must run all your nodes as IBM&#174; Secure Execution guests.


Prepare your RHEL KVM host to support IBM&#174; Secure Execution.

Add your host keys to the KVM guest via Ignition.

To generate the Base64 encoded string, run the following command:

Add Ignition protection

Follow the fast-track installation of RHCOS to install nodes by using the IBM&#174; Secure Execution QCOW image.


When you have completed the fast-track installation of RHCOS and Ignition runs at the first boot, verify if decryption is successful.

If the decryption is successful, you can expect an output similar to the following example:

If the decryption fails, you can expect an output similar to the following example:


Introducing IBM&#174; Secure Execution for Linux

Setting up IBM&#174; Secure Execution on IBM Z
Configuring NBDE with static IP in an IBM Z or IBM LinuxONE environment
Enabling NBDE disk encryption in an IBM Z&#174; or IBM&#174; LinuxONE environment requires additional steps, which are described in detail in this section.

You have set up the External Tang Server. See Network-bound disk encryption for instructions.

You have installed the butane utility.

You have reviewed the instructions for how to create machine configs with Butane.


Create Butane configuration files for the control plane and compute nodes.

Create a customized initramfs file to boot the machine, by running the following command:

Create a parameter file that includes ignition.platform.id=metal and ignition.firstboot.


rd.neednet=1 \
console=ttysclp0 \
ignition.firstboot ignition.platform.id=metal \
coreos.live.rootfs_url=http://<http_server>/rhcos-<version>-live-rootfs.<architecture>.img \1
coreos.inst.ignition_url=http://<http_server>/master.ign \2
ip=10.19.17.2::10.19.17.1:255.255.255.0::enbdd0:none nameserver=10.19.17.1 \
zfcp.allow_lun_scan=0 \
rd.znet=qeth,0.0.bdd0,0.0.bdd1,0.0.bdd2,layer2=1 \
rd.zfcp=0.0.5677,0x600606680g7f0056,0x034F000000000000
Specify the location of the rootfs artifact for the kernel and initramfs you are booting. Only HTTP and HTTPS protocols are supported.

Specify the location of the Ignition config file. Use master.ign or worker.ign. Only HTTP and HTTPS protocols are supported.


Creating machine configs with Butane
Fast-track installation by using a prepackaged QCOW2 disk image
Complete the following steps to create the machines in a fast-track installation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS), importing a prepackaged Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) QEMU copy-on-write (QCOW2) disk image.

At least one LPAR running on RHEL 8.6 or later with KVM, referred to as RHEL KVM host in this procedure.

The KVM/QEMU hypervisor is installed on the RHEL KVM host.

A domain name server (DNS) that can perform hostname and reverse lookup for the nodes.

A DHCP server that provides IP addresses.


Obtain the RHEL QEMU copy-on-write (QCOW2) disk image file from the Product Downloads page on the Red Hat Customer Portal or from the RHCOS image mirror page.

Download the QCOW2 disk image and Ignition files to a common directory on the RHEL KVM host.

Create a new disk image with the QCOW2 disk image backing file for each KVM guest node.

Create the new KVM guest nodes using the Ignition file and the new disk image.
Full installation on a new QCOW2 disk image
Complete the following steps to create the machines in a full installation on a new QEMU copy-on-write (QCOW2) disk image.

At least one LPAR running  on RHEL 8.6 or later with KVM, referred to as RHEL KVM host in this procedure.

The KVM/QEMU hypervisor is installed on the RHEL KVM host.

A domain name server (DNS) that can perform hostname and reverse lookup for the nodes.

An HTTP or HTTPS server is set up.


Obtain the RHEL kernel, initramfs, and rootfs files from the Product Downloads page on the Red Hat Customer Portal or from the RHCOS image mirror page.

Move the downloaded RHEL live kernel, initramfs, and rootfs as well as the Ignition files to an HTTP or HTTPS server before you launch virt-install.

Create the new KVM guest nodes using the RHEL kernel, initramfs, and Ignition files, the new disk image, and adjusted parm line arguments.
Advanced RHCOS installation reference
This section illustrates the networking configuration and other advanced options that allow you to modify the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) manual installation process. The following tables describe the kernel arguments and command-line options you can use with the RHCOS live installer and the coreos-installer command.

Networking options for ISO installations
If you install RHCOS from an ISO image, you can add kernel arguments manually when you boot the image to configure networking for a node. If no networking arguments are specified, DHCP is activated in the initramfs when RHCOS detects that networking is required to fetch the Ignition config file.

When adding networking arguments manually, you must also add the rd.neednet=1 kernel argument to bring the network up in the initramfs.
The following information provides examples for configuring networking on your RHCOS nodes for ISO installations. The examples describe how to use the ip= and nameserver= kernel arguments.

Ordering is important when adding the kernel arguments: ip= and nameserver=.
The networking options are passed to the dracut tool during system boot. For more information about the networking options supported by dracut, see the dracut.cmdline manual page.

The following examples are the networking options for ISO installation.


To configure an IP address, either use DHCP (ip=dhcp) or set an individual static IP address (ip=<host_ip>). If setting a static IP, you must then identify the DNS server IP address (nameserver=<dns_ip>) on each node. The following example sets:

The node's IP address to 10.10.10.2

The gateway address to 10.10.10.254

The netmask to 255.255.255.0

The hostname to core0.example.com

The DNS server address to 4.4.4.41

The auto-configuration value to none. No auto-configuration is required when IP networking is configured statically.


ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:enp1s0:none
nameserver=4.4.4.41
When you use DHCP to configure IP addressing for the RHCOS machines, the machines also obtain the DNS server information through DHCP. For DHCP-based deployments, you can define the DNS server address that is used by the RHCOS nodes through your DHCP server configuration.

You can configure an IP address without assigning a static hostname. If a static hostname is not set by the user, it will be picked up and automatically set by a reverse DNS lookup. To configure an IP address without a static hostname refer to the following example:

The node's IP address to 10.10.10.2

The gateway address to 10.10.10.254

The netmask to 255.255.255.0

The DNS server address to 4.4.4.41

The auto-configuration value to none. No auto-configuration is required when IP networking is configured statically.


ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0::enp1s0:none
nameserver=4.4.4.41

You can specify multiple network interfaces by setting multiple ip= entries.

ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:enp1s0:none
ip=10.10.10.3::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:enp2s0:none

Optional: You can configure routes to additional networks by setting an rd.route= value.

When you configure one or multiple networks, one default gateway is required. If the additional network gateway is different from the primary network gateway, the default gateway must be the primary network gateway.
Run the following command to configure the default gateway:

Enter the following command to configure the route for the additional network:



You can disable DHCP on a single interface, such as when there are two or more network interfaces and only one interface is being used. In the example, the enp1s0 interface has a static networking configuration and DHCP is disabled for enp2s0, which is not used:

ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:enp1s0:none
ip=::::core0.example.com:enp2s0:none

You can combine DHCP and static IP configurations on systems with multiple network interfaces, for example:

ip=enp1s0:dhcp
ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:enp2s0:none

Optional: You can configure VLANs on individual interfaces by using the vlan= parameter.

To configure a VLAN on a network interface and use a static IP address, run the following command:

To configure a VLAN on a network interface and to use DHCP, run the following command:



You can provide multiple DNS servers by adding a nameserver= entry for each server, for example:

nameserver=1.1.1.1
nameserver=8.8.8.8
Waiting for the bootstrap process to complete
The "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" bootstrap process begins after the cluster nodes first boot into the persistent RHCOS environment that has been installed to disk. The configuration information provided through the Ignition config files is used to initialize the bootstrap process and install "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" on the machines. You must wait for the bootstrap process to complete.

You have created the Ignition config files for your cluster.

You have configured suitable network, DNS and load balancing infrastructure.

You have obtained the installation program and generated the Ignition config files for your cluster.

You installed RHCOS on your cluster machines and provided the Ignition config files that the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation program generated.


Monitor the bootstrap process:

After the bootstrap process is complete, remove the bootstrap machine from the
load balancer.
Logging in to the cluster by using the CLI
You can log in to your cluster as a default system user by exporting the cluster kubeconfig file. The kubeconfig file contains information about the cluster that is used by the CLI to connect a client to the correct cluster and API server. The file is specific to a cluster and is created during "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation.

You deployed an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster.

You installed the oc CLI.


Export the kubeadmin credentials:

Verify you can run oc commands successfully using the exported configuration:
Approving the certificate signing requests for your machines
When you add machines to a cluster, two pending certificate signing requests (CSRs) are generated for each machine that you added. You must confirm that these CSRs are approved or, if necessary, approve them yourself. The client requests must be approved first, followed by the server requests.

You added machines to your cluster.


Confirm that the cluster recognizes the machines:

Review the pending CSRs and ensure that you see the client requests with the Pending or Approved status for each machine that you added to the cluster:

If the CSRs were not approved, after all of the pending CSRs for the machines you added are in Pending status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines:

Now that your client requests are approved, you must review the server requests for each machine that you added to the cluster:

If the remaining CSRs are not approved, and are in the Pending status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines:

After all client and server CSRs have been approved, the machines have the Ready status. Verify this by running the following command:


For more information on CSRs, see Certificate Signing Requests.
Initial Operator configuration
After the control plane initializes, you must immediately configure some Operators so that they all become available.

Your control plane has initialized.


Watch the cluster components come online:

Configure the Operators that are not available.


Disabling the default OperatorHub catalog sources
Operator catalogs that source content provided by Red Hat and community projects are configured for OperatorHub by default during an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation. In a restricted network environment, you must disable the default catalogs as a cluster administrator.

Disable the sources for the default catalogs by adding disableAllDefaultSources: true to the OperatorHub object:


Alternatively, you can use the web console to manage catalog sources. From the Administration -> Cluster Settings -> Configuration -> OperatorHub page, click the Sources tab, where you can create, update, delete, disable, and enable individual sources.
Image registry storage configuration
The Image Registry Operator is not initially available for platforms that do not provide default storage. After installation, you must configure your registry to use storage so that the Registry Operator is made available.

Instructions are shown for configuring a persistent volume, which is required for production clusters. Where applicable, instructions are shown for configuring an empty directory as the storage location, which is available for only non-production clusters.

Additional instructions are provided for allowing the image registry to use block storage types by using the Recreate rollout strategy during upgrades.

Configuring registry storage for IBM Z
As a cluster administrator, following installation you must configure your registry to use storage.

You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

You have a cluster
on IBM Z&#174;.

You have provisioned persistent storage for your cluster, such as Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation.

Must have 100Gi capacity.


To configure your registry to use storage, change the spec.storage.pvc in
the configs.imageregistry/cluster resource.

Verify that you do not have a registry pod:

Check the registry configuration:

Check the clusteroperator status:

Ensure that your registry is set to managed to enable building and pushing of images.
Configuring storage for the image registry in non-production clusters
You must configure storage for the Image Registry Operator. For non-production clusters, you can set the image registry to an empty directory. If you do so, all images are lost if you restart the registry.

To set the image registry storage to an empty directory:
Completing installation on user-provisioned infrastructure
After you complete the Operator configuration, you can finish installing the cluster on infrastructure that you provide.

Your control plane has initialized.

You have completed the initial Operator configuration.


Confirm that all the cluster components are online with the following command:

Confirm that the Kubernetes API server is communicating with the pods.

For an installation with Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP), additional steps are required to enable multipathing. Do not enable multipathing during installation.

Register your cluster on the Cluster registration page.
