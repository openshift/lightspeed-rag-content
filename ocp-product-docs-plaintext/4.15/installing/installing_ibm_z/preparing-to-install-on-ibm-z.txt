# Preparing to install on IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE



# Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation and update processes.
* You read the documentation on selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users.
* Before you begin the installation process, you must clean the installation directory. This ensures that the required installation files are created and updated during the installation process.
* You provisioned persistent storage using OpenShift Data Foundation or other supported storage protocols for your cluster. To deploy a private image registry, you must set up persistent storage with ReadWriteMany access.
* If you use a firewall, you configured it to allow the sites that your cluster requires access to.


[NOTE]

While this document refers only to IBM Z(R), all information in it also applies to IBM(R) LinuxONE.

# Choosing a method to install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on IBM Z or IBM LinuxONE

The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program offers the following methods for deploying a cluster on IBM Z&#174;:

* Interactive: You can deploy a cluster with the web-based Assisted Installer. This method requires no setup for the installer, and is ideal for connected environments like IBM Z(R).
* Local Agent-based: You can deploy a cluster locally with the Agent-based Installer. It provides many of the benefits of the Assisted Installer, but you must download and configure the Agent-based Installer first. Configuration is done with a command-line interface (CLI). This approach is ideal for disconnected networks.
* Full control: You can deploy a cluster on infrastructure that you prepare and maintain, which provides maximum customizability. You can deploy clusters in connected or disconnected environments.



For more information about the installation process, see the Installation process.

## User-provisioned infrastructure installation of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on IBM Z

User-provisioned infrastructure requires the user to provision all resources required by Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.


[IMPORTANT]
----
The steps for performing a user-provisioned infrastructure installation are provided as an example only. Installing a cluster with infrastructure you provide requires knowledge of the IBM Z(R) platform and the installation process of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. Use the user-provisioned infrastructure installation instructions as a guide; you are free to create the required resources through other methods.

* Installing a cluster with z/VM on IBM Z(R) and IBM(R) LinuxONE: You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform with z/VM on IBM Z(R) or IBM(R) LinuxONE infrastructure that you provision.
* Installing a cluster with z/VM on IBM Z(R) and IBM(R) LinuxONE in a restricted network: You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform with z/VM on IBM Z(R) or IBM(R) LinuxONE infrastructure that you provision in a restricted or disconnected network by using an internal mirror of the installation release content. You can use this method to install a cluster that does not require an active internet connection to obtain the software components. You can also use this installation method to ensure that your clusters only use container images that satisfy your organizational controls on external content.
* Installing a cluster with RHEL KVM on IBM Z(R) and IBM(R) LinuxONE: You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform with KVM on IBM Z(R) or IBM(R) LinuxONE infrastructure that you provision.
* Installing a cluster with RHEL KVM on IBM Z(R) and IBM(R) LinuxONE in a restricted network: You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform with RHEL KVM on IBM Z(R) or IBM(R) LinuxONE infrastructure that you provision in a restricted or disconnected network by using an internal mirror of the installation release content. You can use this method to install a cluster that does not require an active internet connection to obtain the software components. You can also use this installation method to ensure that your clusters only use container images that satisfy your organizational controls on external content.
* Installing a cluster in an LPAR on IBM Z(R) and IBM(R) LinuxONE: You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform in a logical partition (LPAR) on IBM Z(R) or IBM(R) LinuxONE infrastructure that you provision.
* Installing a cluster in an LPAR on IBM Z(R) and IBM(R) LinuxONE in a restricted network: You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform in an LPAR on IBM Z(R) or IBM(R) LinuxONE infrastructure that you provision in a restricted or disconnected network by using an internal mirror of the installation release content. You can use this method to install a cluster that does not require an active internet connection to obtain the software components. You can also use this installation method to ensure that your clusters only use container images that satisfy your organizational controls on external content.
