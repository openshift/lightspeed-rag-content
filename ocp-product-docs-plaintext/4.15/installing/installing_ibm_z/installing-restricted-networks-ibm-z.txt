# Installing a cluster with z/VM on IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE in a restricted network


In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.15, you can install a cluster on
IBM Z(R) or IBM(R) LinuxONE infrastructure that you provision in a restricted network.

[NOTE]
----
While this document refers to only IBM Z(R), all information in it also applies to IBM(R) LinuxONE.
----

[IMPORTANT]
----
Additional considerations exist for non-bare metal platforms. Review the information in the
guidelines for deploying Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on non-tested platforms before you install an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
----

# Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation and update processes.
* You read the documentation on selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users.
* You created a mirror registry for installation in a restricted network and obtained the imageContentSources data for your version of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
* Before you begin the installation process, you must move or remove any existing installation files. This ensures that the required installation files are created and updated during the installation process.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Ensure that installation steps are done from a machine with access to the installation media.
----
* You provisioned persistent storage using OpenShift Data Foundation or other supported storage protocols for your cluster. To deploy a private image registry, you must set up persistent storage with ReadWriteMany access.
* If you use a firewall and plan to use the Telemetry service, you configured the firewall to allow the sites that your cluster requires access to.

[NOTE]
----
Be sure to also review this site list if you are configuring a proxy.
----

# About installations in restricted networks

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15, you can perform an installation that does not
require an active connection to the internet to obtain software components. Restricted network installations can be completed using installer-provisioned infrastructure or user-provisioned infrastructure, depending on the cloud platform to which you are installing the cluster.

If you choose to perform a restricted network installation on a cloud platform, you
still require access to its cloud APIs. Some cloud functions, like
Amazon Web Service&#8217;s Route 53 DNS and IAM services, require internet access.
Depending on your network, you might require less internet
access for an installation on bare metal hardware, Nutanix, or on VMware vSphere.

To complete a restricted network installation, you must create a registry that
mirrors the contents of the OpenShift image registry and contains the
installation media. You can create this registry on a mirror host, which can
access both the internet and your closed network, or by using other methods
that meet your restrictions.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Because of the complexity of the configuration for user-provisioned installations, consider completing a standard user-provisioned infrastructure installation before you attempt a restricted network installation using user-provisioned infrastructure. Completing this test installation might make it easier to isolate and troubleshoot any issues that might arise during your installation in a restricted network.
----

## Additional limits

Clusters in restricted networks have the following additional limitations and restrictions:

* The ClusterVersion status includes an Unable to retrieve available updates
error.
* By default, you cannot use the contents of the Developer Catalog because
you cannot access the required image stream tags.

# Internet access for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15, you require access to the internet to
obtain the images that are necessary to install
your cluster.

You must have internet access to:

* Access https://console.redhat.com/openshift [OpenShift Cluster Manager] to download the installation program and perform subscription management. If the cluster has internet access and you do not disable Telemetry, that service automatically entitles your cluster.
* Access Quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install your cluster.
* Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.

# Requirements for a cluster with user-provisioned infrastructure

For a cluster that contains user-provisioned infrastructure, you must deploy all
of the required machines.

This section describes the requirements for deploying Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on user-provisioned infrastructure.

## Required machines for cluster installation

The smallest Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters require the following hosts:




[IMPORTANT]
----
To improve high availability of your cluster, distribute the control plane machines over different z/VM instances on at least two physical machines.
----

The bootstrap, control plane, and compute machines must use Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) as the operating system.

Note that RHCOS is based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9.2 and inherits all of its hardware certifications and requirements.
See Red Hat Enterprise Linux technology capabilities and limits.

## Minimum resource requirements for cluster installation

Each cluster machine must meet the following minimum requirements:



1. One physical core (IFL) provides two logical cores (threads) when SMT-2 is enabled. The hypervisor can provide two or more vCPUs.


[NOTE]
----
As of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.13, RHCOS is based on RHEL version 9.2, which updates the micro-architecture requirements. The following list contains the minimum instruction set architectures (ISA) that each architecture requires:
* x86-64 architecture requires x86-64-v2 ISA
* ARM64 architecture requires ARMv8.0-A ISA
* IBM Power architecture requires Power 9 ISA
* s390x architecture requires z14 ISA
For more information, see Architectures (RHEL documentation).
----

If an instance type for your platform meets the minimum requirements for cluster machines, it is supported to use in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

* Optimizing storage

## Minimum IBM Z system environment

You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.15 on the following IBM&#174; hardware:

* IBM(R) z16 (all models), IBM(R) z15 (all models), IBM(R) z14 (all models)
* IBM(R) LinuxONE 4 (all models), IBM(R) LinuxONE III (all models), IBM(R) LinuxONE Emperor II, IBM(R) LinuxONE Rockhopper II

## Hardware requirements

* The equivalent of six Integrated Facilities for Linux (IFL), which are SMT2 enabled, for each cluster.
* At least one network connection to both connect to the LoadBalancer service and to serve data for traffic outside the cluster.


[NOTE]
----
You can use dedicated or shared IFLs to assign sufficient compute resources. Resource sharing is one of the key strengths of IBM Z(R). However, you must adjust capacity correctly on each hypervisor layer and ensure sufficient resources for every Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
----


[IMPORTANT]
----
Since the overall performance of the cluster can be impacted, the LPARs that are used to set up the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters must provide sufficient compute capacity. In this context, LPAR weight management, entitlements, and CPU shares on the hypervisor level play an important role.
----

## Operating system requirements

* One instance of z/VM 7.2 or later

On your z/VM instance, set up:

* Three guest virtual machines for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform control plane machines
* Two guest virtual machines for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform compute machines
* One guest virtual machine for the temporary Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform bootstrap machine

## IBM Z network connectivity requirements

To install on IBM Z&#174; under z/VM, you require a single z/VM virtual NIC in layer 2 mode. You also need:

* A direct-attached OSA or RoCE network adapter
* A z/VM VSWITCH in layer 2 Ethernet mode set up.

## Disk storage

* FICON attached disk storage (DASDs). These can be z/VM minidisks, fullpack minidisks, or dedicated DASDs, all of which must be formatted as CDL, which is the default. To reach the minimum required DASD size for Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) installations, you need extended address volumes (EAV). If available, use HyperPAV to ensure optimal performance.
* FCP attached disk storage

## Storage / Main Memory

* 16 GB for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform control plane machines
* 8 GB for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform compute machines
* 16 GB for the temporary Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform bootstrap machine

## Preferred IBM Z system environment

## Hardware requirements

* Three LPARS that each have the equivalent of six IFLs, which are SMT2 enabled, for each cluster.
* Two network connections to both connect to the LoadBalancer service and to serve data for traffic outside the cluster.
* HiperSockets that are attached to a node either directly as a device or by bridging with one z/VM VSWITCH to be transparent to the z/VM guest. To directly connect HiperSockets to a node, you must set up a gateway to the external network via a RHEL 8 guest to bridge to the HiperSockets network.

## Operating system requirements

* Two or three instances of z/VM 7.2 or later for high availability

On your z/VM instances, set up:

* Three guest virtual machines for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform control plane machines, one per z/VM instance.
* At least six guest virtual machines for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform compute machines, distributed across the z/VM instances.
* One guest virtual machine for the temporary Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform bootstrap machine.
* To ensure the availability of integral components in an overcommitted environment, increase the priority of the control plane by using the CP command SET SHARE. Do the same for infrastructure nodes, if they exist. See SET SHARE (IBM(R) Documentation).

## IBM Z network connectivity requirements

To install on IBM Z&#174; under z/VM, you require a single z/VM virtual NIC in layer 2 mode. You also need:

* A direct-attached OSA or RoCE network adapter
* A z/VM VSWITCH in layer 2 Ethernet mode set up.

## Disk storage

* FICON attached disk storage (DASDs). These can be z/VM minidisks, fullpack minidisks, or dedicated DASDs, all of which must be formatted as CDL, which is the default. To reach the minimum required DASD size for Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) installations, you need extended address volumes (EAV). If available, use HyperPAV to ensure optimal performance.
* FCP attached disk storage

## Storage / Main Memory

* 16 GB for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform control plane machines
* 8 GB for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform compute machines
* 16 GB for the temporary Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform bootstrap machine

## Certificate signing requests management

Because your cluster has limited access to automatic machine management when you use infrastructure that you provision, you must provide a mechanism for approving cluster certificate signing requests (CSRs) after installation. The kube-controller-manager only approves the kubelet client CSRs. The machine-approver cannot guarantee the validity of a serving certificate that is requested by using kubelet credentials because it cannot confirm that the correct machine issued the request. You must determine and implement a method of verifying the validity of the kubelet serving certificate requests and approving them.

* See Bridging a HiperSockets LAN with a z/VM Virtual Switch in IBM(R) Documentation.
* See Scaling HyperPAV alias devices on Linux guests on z/VM for performance optimization.
* See Topics in LPAR performance for LPAR weight management and entitlements.
* Recommended host practices for IBM Z(R) & IBM(R) LinuxONE environments

## Networking requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure

All the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines require networking to be configured in initramfs during boot
to fetch their Ignition config files.

During the initial boot, the machines require an IP address configuration that is set either through a DHCP server or statically by providing the required boot options. After a network connection is established, the machines download their Ignition config files from an HTTP or HTTPS server. The Ignition config files are then used to set the exact state of each machine. The Machine Config Operator completes more changes to the machines, such as the application of new certificates or keys, after installation.


[NOTE]
----
* It is recommended to use a DHCP server for long-term management of the cluster machines. Ensure that the DHCP server is configured to provide persistent IP addresses, DNS server information, and hostnames to the cluster machines.
* If a DHCP service is not available for your user-provisioned infrastructure, you can instead provide the IP networking configuration and the address of the DNS server to the nodes at RHCOS install time. These can be passed as boot arguments if you are installing from an ISO image. See the Installing RHCOS and starting the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform bootstrap process section for more information about static IP provisioning and advanced networking options.
----

The Kubernetes API server must be able to resolve the node names of the cluster
machines. If the API servers and worker nodes are in different zones, you can
configure a default DNS search zone to allow the API server to resolve the
node names. Another supported approach is to always refer to hosts by their
fully-qualified domain names in both the node objects and all DNS requests.

### Setting the cluster node hostnames through DHCP

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines, the hostname is set through NetworkManager. By default, the machines obtain their hostname through DHCP. If the hostname is not provided by DHCP, set statically through kernel arguments, or another method, it is obtained through a reverse DNS lookup. Reverse DNS lookup occurs after the network has been initialized on a node and can take time to resolve. Other system services can start prior to this and detect the hostname as localhost or similar. You can avoid this by using DHCP to provide the hostname for each cluster node.

Additionally, setting the hostnames through DHCP can bypass any manual DNS record name configuration errors in environments that have a DNS split-horizon implementation.

### Network connectivity requirements

You must configure the network connectivity between machines to allow Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster
components to communicate. Each machine must be able to resolve the hostnames
of all other machines in the cluster.

This section provides details about the ports that are required.







## NTP configuration for user-provisioned infrastructure

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters are configured to use a public Network Time Protocol (NTP) server by default. If you want to use a local enterprise NTP server, or if your cluster is being deployed in a disconnected network, you can configure the cluster to use a specific time server. For more information, see the documentation for Configuring chrony time service.

* Configuring chrony time service

## User-provisioned DNS requirements

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform deployments, DNS name resolution is required for the following components:

* The Kubernetes API
* The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform application wildcard
* The bootstrap, control plane, and compute machines

Reverse DNS resolution is also required for the Kubernetes API, the bootstrap machine, the control plane machines, and the compute machines.

DNS A/AAAA or CNAME records are used for name resolution and PTR records are used for reverse name resolution. The reverse records are important because Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) uses the reverse records to set the hostnames for all the nodes, unless the hostnames are provided by DHCP. Additionally, the reverse records are used to generate the certificate signing requests (CSR) that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform needs to operate.

The following DNS records are required for a user-provisioned Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster and they must be in place before installation. In each record, <cluster_name> is the cluster name and <base_domain> is the base domain that you specify in the install-config.yaml file. A complete DNS record takes the form: <component>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>..




[NOTE]
----
In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.4 and later, you do not need to specify etcd host and SRV records in your DNS configuration.
----


[TIP]
----
You can use the dig command to verify name and reverse name resolution. See the section on Validating DNS resolution for user-provisioned infrastructure for detailed validation steps.
----

### Example DNS configuration for user-provisioned clusters

This section provides A and PTR record configuration samples that meet the DNS requirements for deploying Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on user-provisioned infrastructure. The samples are not meant to provide advice for choosing one DNS solution over another.

In the examples, the cluster name is ocp4 and the base domain is example.com.

The following example is a BIND zone file that shows sample A records for name resolution in a user-provisioned cluster.

[NOTE]
----
A PTR record is not required for the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform application wildcard.

## Load balancing requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure

Before you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, you must provision the API and application Ingress load balancing infrastructure. In production scenarios, you can deploy the API and application Ingress load balancers separately so that you can scale the load balancer infrastructure for each in isolation.


[NOTE]
----
If you want to deploy the API and application Ingress load balancers with a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) instance, you must purchase the RHEL subscription separately.
----

The load balancing infrastructure must meet the following requirements:

1. API load balancer: Provides a common endpoint for users, both human and machine, to interact with and configure the platform. Configure the following conditions:
* Layer 4 load balancing only. This can be referred to as Raw TCP or SSL Passthrough mode.
* A stateless load balancing algorithm. The options vary based on the load balancer implementation.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not configure session persistence for an API load balancer. Configuring session persistence for a Kubernetes API server might cause performance issues from excess application traffic for your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster and the Kubernetes API that runs inside the cluster.
----

Configure the following ports on both the front and back of the load balancers:
API load balancer


[NOTE]
----
The load balancer must be configured to take a maximum of 30 seconds from the
time the API server turns off the /readyz endpoint to the removal of the API
server instance from the pool. Within the time frame after /readyz returns an
error or becomes healthy, the endpoint must have been removed or added. Probing
every 5 or 10 seconds, with two successful requests to become healthy and three
to become unhealthy, are well-tested values.
----
2. Application Ingress load balancer: Provides an ingress point for application traffic flowing in from outside the cluster. A working configuration for the Ingress router is required for an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

Configure the following conditions:
* Layer 4 load balancing only. This can be referred to as Raw TCP or SSL Passthrough mode.
* A connection-based or session-based persistence is recommended, based on the options available and types of applications that will be hosted on the platform.

[TIP]
----
If the true IP address of the client can be seen by the application Ingress load balancer, enabling source IP-based session persistence can improve performance for applications that use end-to-end TLS encryption.
----

Configure the following ports on both the front and back of the load balancers:
Application Ingress load balancer


[NOTE]
----
If you are deploying a three-node cluster with zero compute nodes, the Ingress Controller pods run on the control plane nodes. In three-node cluster deployments, you must configure your application Ingress load balancer to route HTTP and HTTPS traffic to the control plane nodes.
----

### Example load balancer configuration for user-provisioned clusters

This section provides an example API and application Ingress load balancer configuration that meets the load balancing requirements for user-provisioned clusters. The sample is an /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg configuration for an HAProxy load balancer. The example is not meant to provide advice for choosing one load balancing solution over another.

In the example, the same load balancer is used for the Kubernetes API and application ingress traffic. In production scenarios, you can deploy the API and application ingress load balancers separately so that you can scale the load balancer infrastructure for each in isolation.


[NOTE]
----
If you are using HAProxy as a load balancer and SELinux is set to enforcing, you must ensure that the HAProxy service can bind to the configured TCP port by running setsebool -P haproxy_connect_any=1.

Port 6443 handles the Kubernetes API traffic and points to the control plane machines.
The bootstrap entries must be in place before the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster installation and they must be removed after the bootstrap process is complete.
Port 22623 handles the machine config server traffic and points to the control plane machines.
Port 443 handles the HTTPS traffic and points to the machines that run the Ingress Controller pods. The Ingress Controller pods run on the compute machines by default.
Port 80 handles the HTTP traffic and points to the machines that run the Ingress Controller pods. The Ingress Controller pods run on the compute machines by default.

[NOTE]
----
If you are deploying a three-node cluster with zero compute nodes, the Ingress Controller pods run on the control plane nodes. In three-node cluster deployments, you must configure your application Ingress load balancer to route HTTP and HTTPS traffic to the control plane nodes.
----


[TIP]
----
If you are using HAProxy as a load balancer, you can check that the haproxy process is listening on ports 6443, 22623, 443, and 80 by running netstat -nltupe on the HAProxy node.

# Preparing the user-provisioned infrastructure

Before you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on user-provisioned infrastructure, you must prepare the underlying infrastructure.

This section provides details about the high-level steps required to set up your cluster infrastructure in preparation for an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation. This includes configuring IP networking and network connectivity for your cluster nodes,
preparing a web server for the Ignition files,
enabling the required ports through your firewall, and setting up the required DNS and load balancing infrastructure.

After preparation, your cluster infrastructure must meet the requirements outlined in the Requirements for a cluster with user-provisioned infrastructure section.

* You have reviewed the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.x Tested Integrations page.
* You have reviewed the infrastructure requirements detailed in the Requirements for a cluster with user-provisioned infrastructure section.

1. Set up static IP addresses.
2. Set up an HTTP or HTTPS server to provide Ignition files to the cluster nodes.
3. Ensure that your network infrastructure provides the required network connectivity between the cluster components. See the Networking requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure section for details about the requirements.
4. Configure your firewall to enable the ports required for the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster components to communicate. See Networking requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure section for details about the ports that are required.

[IMPORTANT]
----
By default, port 1936 is accessible for an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, because each control plane node needs access to this port.
Avoid using the Ingress load balancer to expose this port, because doing so might result in the exposure of sensitive information, such as statistics and metrics, related to Ingress Controllers.
----
5. Setup the required DNS infrastructure for your cluster.
1. Configure DNS name resolution for the Kubernetes API, the application wildcard, the bootstrap machine, the control plane machines, and the compute machines.
2. Configure reverse DNS resolution for the Kubernetes API, the bootstrap machine, the control plane machines, and the compute machines.

See the User-provisioned DNS requirements section for more information about the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform DNS requirements.
6. Validate your DNS configuration.
1. From your installation node, run DNS lookups against the record names of the Kubernetes API, the wildcard routes, and the cluster nodes. Validate that the IP addresses in the responses correspond to the correct components.
2. From your installation node, run reverse DNS lookups against the IP addresses of the load balancer and the cluster nodes. Validate that the record names in the responses correspond to the correct components.

See the Validating DNS resolution for user-provisioned infrastructure section for detailed DNS validation steps.
7. Provision the required API and application ingress load balancing infrastructure. See the Load balancing requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure section for more information about the requirements.


[NOTE]
----
Some load balancing solutions require the DNS name resolution for the cluster nodes to be in place before the load balancing is initialized.
----

# Validating DNS resolution for user-provisioned infrastructure

You can validate your DNS configuration before installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on user-provisioned infrastructure.


[IMPORTANT]
----
The validation steps detailed in this section must succeed before you install your cluster.
----

* You have configured the required DNS records for your user-provisioned infrastructure.

1. From your installation node, run DNS lookups against the record names of the Kubernetes API, the wildcard routes, and the cluster nodes. Validate that the IP addresses contained in the responses correspond to the correct components.
1. Perform a lookup against the Kubernetes API record name. Check that the result points to the IP address of the API load balancer:

```terminal
$ dig +noall +answer @<nameserver_ip> api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain> 1
```

Replace <nameserver_ip> with the IP address of the nameserver, <cluster_name> with your cluster name, and <base_domain> with your base domain name.
Example output

```terminal
api.ocp4.example.com.		604800	IN	A	192.168.1.5
```

2. Perform a lookup against the Kubernetes internal API record name. Check that the result points to the IP address of the API load balancer:

```terminal
$ dig +noall +answer @<nameserver_ip> api-int.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
```

Example output

```terminal
api-int.ocp4.example.com.		604800	IN	A	192.168.1.5
```

3. Test an example *.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain> DNS wildcard lookup. All of the application wildcard lookups must resolve to the IP address of the application ingress load balancer:

```terminal
$ dig +noall +answer @<nameserver_ip> random.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
```

Example output

```terminal
random.apps.ocp4.example.com.		604800	IN	A	192.168.1.5
```


[NOTE]
----
In the example outputs, the same load balancer is used for the Kubernetes API and application ingress traffic. In production scenarios, you can deploy the API and application ingress load balancers separately so that you can scale the load balancer infrastructure for each in isolation.
----

You can replace random with another wildcard value. For example, you can query the route to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform console:

```terminal
$ dig +noall +answer @<nameserver_ip> console-openshift-console.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
```

Example output

```terminal
console-openshift-console.apps.ocp4.example.com. 604800 IN	A 192.168.1.5
```

4. Run a lookup against the bootstrap DNS record name. Check that the result points to the IP address of the bootstrap node:

```terminal
$ dig +noall +answer @<nameserver_ip> bootstrap.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
```

Example output

```terminal
bootstrap.ocp4.example.com.		604800	IN	A	192.168.1.96
```

5. Use this method to perform lookups against the DNS record names for the control plane and compute nodes. Check that the results correspond to the IP addresses of each node.
2. From your installation node, run reverse DNS lookups against the IP addresses of the load balancer and the cluster nodes. Validate that the record names contained in the responses correspond to the correct components.
1. Perform a reverse lookup against the IP address of the API load balancer. Check that the response includes the record names for the Kubernetes API and the Kubernetes internal API:

```terminal
$ dig +noall +answer @<nameserver_ip> -x 192.168.1.5
```

Example output

```terminal
5.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa. 604800	IN	PTR	api-int.ocp4.example.com. 1
5.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa. 604800	IN	PTR	api.ocp4.example.com. 2
```

Provides the record name for the Kubernetes internal API.
Provides the record name for the Kubernetes API.

[NOTE]
----
A PTR record is not required for the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform application wildcard. No validation step is needed for reverse DNS resolution against the IP address of the application ingress load balancer.
----
2. Perform a reverse lookup against the IP address of the bootstrap node. Check that the result points to the DNS record name of the bootstrap node:

```terminal
$ dig +noall +answer @<nameserver_ip> -x 192.168.1.96
```

Example output

```terminal
96.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa. 604800	IN	PTR	bootstrap.ocp4.example.com.
```

3. Use this method to perform reverse lookups against the IP addresses for the control plane and compute nodes. Check that the results correspond to the DNS record names of each node.

# Generating a key pair for cluster node SSH access

During an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation, you can provide an SSH public key to the installation program. The key is passed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) nodes through their Ignition config files and is used to authenticate SSH access to the nodes. The key is added to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys list for the core user on each node, which enables password-less authentication.

After the key is passed to the nodes, you can use the key pair to SSH in to the RHCOS nodes as the user core. To access the nodes through SSH, the private key identity must be managed by SSH for your local user.

If you want to SSH in to your cluster nodes to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, you must provide the SSH public key during the installation process. The ./openshift-install gather command also requires the SSH public key to be in place on the cluster nodes.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not skip this procedure in production environments, where disaster recovery and debugging is required.
----

1. If you do not have an existing SSH key pair on your local machine to use for authentication onto your cluster nodes, create one. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

```terminal
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N '' -f <path>/<file_name> 1
```

Specify the path and file name, such as ~/.ssh/id_ed25519, of the new SSH key. If you have an existing key pair, ensure your public key is in the your ~/.ssh directory.

[NOTE]
----
If you plan to install an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster that uses the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures, do not create a key that uses the ed25519 algorithm. Instead, create a key that uses the rsa or ecdsa algorithm.
----
2. View the public SSH key:

```terminal
$ cat <path>/<file_name>.pub
```


For example, run the following to view the ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub public key:

```terminal
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

3. Add the SSH private key identity to the SSH agent for your local user, if it has not already been added. SSH agent management of the key is required for password-less SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes, or if you want to use the ./openshift-install gather command.

[NOTE]
----
On some distributions, default SSH private key identities such as ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_dsa are managed automatically.
----
1. If the ssh-agent process is not already running for your local user, start it as a background task:

```terminal
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

Example output

```terminal
Agent pid 31874
```


[NOTE]
----
If your cluster is in FIPS mode, only use FIPS-compliant algorithms to generate the SSH key. The key must be either RSA or ECDSA.
----
4. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent:

```terminal
$ ssh-add <path>/<file_name> 1
```

Specify the path and file name for your SSH private key, such as ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
Example output

```terminal
Identity added: /home/<you>/<path>/<file_name> (<computer_name>)
```


* When you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, provide the SSH public key to the installation program.

# Manually creating the installation configuration file

Installing the cluster requires that you manually create the installation configuration file.

* You have an SSH public key on your local machine to provide to the installation program. The key will be used for SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes for debugging and disaster recovery.
* You have obtained the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your
cluster.

1. Create an installation directory to store your required installation assets in:

```terminal
$ mkdir <installation_directory>
```


[IMPORTANT]
----
You must create a directory. Some installation assets, like bootstrap X.509
certificates have short expiration intervals, so you must not reuse an
installation directory. If you want to reuse individual files from another
cluster installation, you can copy them into your directory. However, the file
names for the installation assets might change between releases. Use caution
when copying installation files from an earlier Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version.
----
2. Customize the sample install-config.yaml file template that is provided and save
it in the <installation_directory>.

[NOTE]
----
You must name this configuration file install-config.yaml.
----
3. Back up the install-config.yaml file so that you can use it to install multiple clusters.

[IMPORTANT]
----
The install-config.yaml file is consumed during the next step of the installation process. You must back it up now.
----

* Installation configuration parameters for IBM Z(R)

## Sample install-config.yaml file for IBM Z

You can customize the install-config.yaml file to specify more details about your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster&#8217;s platform or modify the values of the required parameters.

The base domain of the cluster. All DNS records must be sub-domains of this base and include the cluster name.
The controlPlane section is a single mapping, but the compute section is a sequence of mappings. To meet the requirements of the different data structures, the first line of the compute section must begin with a hyphen, -, and the first line of the controlPlane section must not. Only one control plane pool is used.
Specifies whether to enable or disable simultaneous multithreading (SMT), or hyperthreading. By default, SMT is enabled to increase the performance of the cores in your machines. You can disable it by setting the parameter value to Disabled. If you disable SMT, you must disable it in all cluster machines; this includes both control plane and compute machines.

[NOTE]
----
Simultaneous multithreading (SMT) is enabled by default. If SMT is not available on your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform nodes, the hyperthreading parameter has no effect.
----

[IMPORTANT]
----
If you disable hyperthreading, whether on your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform nodes or in the install-config.yaml file, ensure that your capacity planning accounts for the dramatically decreased machine performance.
----
You must set this value to 0 when you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on user-provisioned infrastructure. In installer-provisioned installations, the parameter controls the number of compute machines that the cluster creates and manages for you. In user-provisioned installations, you must manually deploy the compute machines before you finish installing the cluster.

[NOTE]
----
If you are installing a three-node cluster, do not deploy any compute machines when you install the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines.
----
The number of control plane machines that you add to the cluster. Because the cluster uses these values as the number of etcd endpoints in the cluster, the value must match the number of control plane machines that you deploy.
The cluster name that you specified in your DNS records.
A block of IP addresses from which pod IP addresses are allocated. This block must not overlap with existing physical networks. These IP addresses are used for the pod network. If you need to access the pods from an external network, you must configure load balancers and routers to manage the traffic.

[NOTE]
----
Class E CIDR range is reserved for a future use. To use the Class E CIDR range, you must ensure your networking environment accepts the IP addresses within the Class E CIDR range.
----
The subnet prefix length to assign to each individual node. For example, if hostPrefix is set to 23, then each node is assigned a /23 subnet out of the given cidr, which allows for 510 (2^(32 - 23) - 2) pod IP addresses. If you are required to provide access to nodes from an external network, configure load balancers and routers to manage the traffic.
The cluster network plugin to install. The default value OVNKubernetes is the only supported value.
The IP address pool to use for service IP addresses. You can enter only one IP address pool. This block must not overlap with existing physical networks. If you need to access the services from an external network, configure load balancers and routers to manage the traffic.
You must set the platform to none. You cannot provide additional platform configuration variables for
IBM Z(R) infrastructure.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Clusters that are installed with the platform type none are unable to use some features, such as managing compute machines with the Machine API. This limitation applies even if the compute machines that are attached to the cluster are installed on a platform that would normally support the feature. This parameter cannot be changed after installation.
----
Whether to enable or disable FIPS mode. By default, FIPS mode is not enabled. If FIPS mode is enabled, the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform runs on bypass the default Kubernetes cryptography suite and use the cryptography modules that are provided with RHCOS instead.

[IMPORTANT]
----
To enable FIPS mode for your cluster, you must run the installation program from a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) computer configured to operate in FIPS mode. For more information about configuring FIPS mode on RHEL, see Installing the system in FIPS mode. When running Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) booted in FIPS mode, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform core components use the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures.
----
For <local_registry>, specify the registry domain name, and optionally the port, that your mirror registry uses to serve content. For example, registry.example.com or registry.example.com:5000. For <credentials>, specify the base64-encoded user name and password for your mirror registry.
The SSH public key for the core user in Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS).

[NOTE]
----
For production Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your ssh-agent process uses.
----
Add the additionalTrustBundle parameter and value. The value must be the contents of the certificate file that you used for your mirror registry. The certificate file can be an existing, trusted certificate authority or the self-signed certificate that you generated for the mirror registry.
Provide the imageContentSources section according to the output of the command that you used to mirror the repository.

[IMPORTANT]
----
* When using the oc adm release mirror command, use the output from the imageContentSources section.
* When using oc mirror command, use the repositoryDigestMirrors section of the ImageContentSourcePolicy file that results from running the command.
* ImageContentSourcePolicy is deprecated. For more information see Configuring image registry repository mirroring.
----

## Configuring the cluster-wide proxy during installation

Production environments can deny direct access to the internet and instead have
an HTTP or HTTPS proxy available. You can configure a new Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
cluster to use a proxy by configuring the proxy settings in the
install-config.yaml file.

* You have an existing install-config.yaml file.
* You reviewed the sites that your cluster requires access to and determined whether any of them need to bypass the proxy. By default, all cluster egress traffic is proxied, including calls to hosting cloud provider APIs. You added sites to the Proxy object's spec.noProxy field to bypass the proxy if necessary.

[NOTE]
----
The Proxy object status.noProxy field is populated with the values of the networking.machineNetwork[].cidr, networking.clusterNetwork[].cidr, and networking.serviceNetwork[] fields from your installation configuration.
For installations on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, and Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP), the Proxy object status.noProxy field is also populated with the instance metadata endpoint (169.254.169.254).
----

1. Edit your install-config.yaml file and add the proxy settings. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: my.domain.com
proxy:
  httpProxy: http://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port> 1
  httpsProxy: https://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port> 2
  noProxy: example.com 3
additionalTrustBundle: | 4
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    <MY_TRUSTED_CA_CERT>
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
additionalTrustBundlePolicy: <policy_to_add_additionalTrustBundle> 5
```

A proxy URL to use for creating HTTP connections outside the cluster. The
URL scheme must be http.
A proxy URL to use for creating HTTPS connections outside the cluster.
A comma-separated list of destination domain names, IP addresses, or other network CIDRs to exclude from proxying. Preface a domain with . to match subdomains only. For example, .y.com matches x.y.com, but not y.com. Use * to bypass the proxy for all destinations.
If provided, the installation program generates a config map that is named user-ca-bundle in
the openshift-config namespace that contains one or more additional CA
certificates that are required for proxying HTTPS connections. The Cluster Network
Operator then creates a trusted-ca-bundle config map that merges these contents
with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) trust bundle, and this config map is referenced in the trustedCA field of the Proxy object. The additionalTrustBundle field is required unless
the proxy's identity certificate is signed by an authority from the RHCOS trust
bundle.
Optional: The policy to determine the configuration of the Proxy object to reference the user-ca-bundle config map in the trustedCA field. The allowed values are Proxyonly and Always. Use Proxyonly to reference the user-ca-bundle config map only when http/https proxy is configured. Use Always to always reference the user-ca-bundle config map. The default value is Proxyonly.

[NOTE]
----
The installation program does not support the proxy readinessEndpoints field.
----

[NOTE]
----
If the installer times out, restart and then complete the deployment by using the wait-for command of the installer. For example:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install wait-for install-complete --log-level debug
```

----
2. Save the file and reference it when installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

The installation program creates a cluster-wide proxy that is named cluster that uses the proxy
settings in the provided install-config.yaml file. If no proxy settings are
provided, a cluster Proxy object is still created, but it will have a nil
spec.


[NOTE]
----
Only the Proxy object named cluster is supported, and no additional
proxies can be created.
----

## Configuring a three-node cluster

Optionally, you can deploy zero compute machines in a minimal three node cluster that consists of three control plane machines only. This provides smaller, more resource efficient clusters for cluster administrators and developers to use for testing, development, and production.

In three-node Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform environments, the three control plane machines are schedulable, which means that your application workloads are scheduled to run on them.

* You have an existing install-config.yaml file.

* Ensure that the number of compute replicas is set to 0 in your install-config.yaml file, as shown in the following compute stanza:

```yaml
compute:
- name: worker
  platform: {}
  replicas: 0
```


[NOTE]
----
You must set the value of the replicas parameter for the compute machines to 0 when you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on user-provisioned infrastructure, regardless of the number of compute machines you are deploying. In installer-provisioned installations, the parameter controls the number of compute machines that the cluster creates and manages for you. This does not apply to user-provisioned installations, where the compute machines are deployed manually.
----

[NOTE]
----
The preferred resource for control plane nodes is six vCPUs and 21 GB. For three control plane nodes this is the memory + vCPU equivalent of a minimum five-node cluster. You should back the three nodes, each installed on a 120 GB disk, with three IFLs that are SMT2 enabled. The minimum tested setup is three vCPUs and 10 GB on a 120 GB disk for each control plane node.
----

For three-node cluster installations, follow these next steps:

* If you are deploying a three-node cluster with zero compute nodes, the Ingress Controller pods run on the control plane nodes. In three-node cluster deployments, you must configure your application ingress load balancer to route HTTP and HTTPS traffic to the control plane nodes. See the Load balancing requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure section for more information.
* When you create the Kubernetes manifest files in the following procedure, ensure that the mastersSchedulable parameter in the <installation_directory>/manifests/cluster-scheduler-02-config.yml file is set to true. This enables your application workloads to run on the control plane nodes.
* Do not deploy any compute nodes when you create the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines.

# Cluster Network Operator configuration

The configuration for the cluster network is specified as part of the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) configuration and stored in a custom resource (CR) object that is named cluster. The CR specifies the fields for the Network API in the operator.openshift.io API group.

The CNO configuration inherits the following fields during cluster installation from the Network API in the Network.config.openshift.io API group:

clusterNetwork:: IP address pools from which pod IP addresses are allocated.
serviceNetwork:: IP address pool for services.
defaultNetwork.type:: Cluster network plugin. OVNKubernetes is the only supported plugin during installation.

You can specify the cluster network plugin configuration for your cluster by setting the fields for the defaultNetwork object in the CNO object named cluster.

## Cluster Network Operator configuration object

The fields for the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) are described in the following table:




[IMPORTANT]
----
For a cluster that needs to deploy objects across multiple networks, ensure that you specify the same value for the clusterNetwork.hostPrefix parameter for each network type that is defined in the install-config.yaml file. Setting a different value for each clusterNetwork.hostPrefix parameter can impact the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, where the plugin cannot effectively route object traffic among different nodes.
----

## defaultNetwork object configuration

The values for the defaultNetwork object are defined in the following table:



## Configuration for the OpenShift SDN network plugin

The following table describes the configuration fields for the OpenShift SDN network plugin:



## Configuration for the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin

The following table describes the configuration fields for the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin:


















```yaml
defaultNetwork:
  type: OVNKubernetes
  ovnKubernetesConfig:
    mtu: 1400
    genevePort: 6081
    ipsecConfig:
      mode: Full
```



[IMPORTANT]
----
Using OVNKubernetes can lead to a stack exhaustion problem on IBM Power(R).
----

## kubeProxyConfig object configuration (OpenShiftSDN container network interface only)

The values for the kubeProxyConfig object are defined in the following table:



# Creating the Kubernetes manifest and Ignition config files

Because you must modify some cluster definition files and manually start the cluster machines, you must generate the Kubernetes manifest and Ignition config files that the cluster needs to configure the machines.

The installation configuration file transforms into the Kubernetes manifests. The manifests wrap into the Ignition configuration files, which are later used to configure the cluster machines.


[IMPORTANT]
----
* The Ignition config files that the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending node-bootstrapper certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for Recovering from expired control plane certificates for more information.
* It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.
----


[NOTE]
----
The installation program that generates the manifest and Ignition files is architecture specific and can be obtained from the
client image mirror. The Linux version of the installation program runs on s390x only. This installer program is also available as a Mac OS version.
----

* You obtained the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program.
For a restricted network installation, these files are on your mirror host.
* You created the install-config.yaml installation configuration file.

1. Change to the directory that contains the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program and generate the Kubernetes manifests for the cluster:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory> 1
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the installation directory that
contains the install-config.yaml file you created.

[WARNING]
----
If you are installing a three-node cluster, skip the following step to allow the control plane nodes to be schedulable.
----

[IMPORTANT]
----
When you configure control plane nodes from the default unschedulable to schedulable, additional subscriptions are required. This is because control plane nodes then become compute nodes.
----
2. Check that the mastersSchedulable parameter in the <installation_directory>/manifests/cluster-scheduler-02-config.yml Kubernetes manifest file is set to false. This setting prevents pods from being scheduled on the control plane machines:
1. Open the <installation_directory>/manifests/cluster-scheduler-02-config.yml file.
2. Locate the mastersSchedulable parameter and ensure that it is set to false.
3. Save and exit the file.
3. To create the Ignition configuration files, run the following command from the directory that contains the installation program:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install create ignition-configs --dir <installation_directory> 1
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the same installation directory.

Ignition config files are created for the bootstrap, control plane, and compute nodes in the installation directory. The kubeadmin-password and kubeconfig files are created in the ./<installation_directory>/auth directory:

```
.
├── auth
│   ├── kubeadmin-password
│   └── kubeconfig
├── bootstrap.ign
├── master.ign
├── metadata.json
└── worker.ign
```


# Configuring NBDE with static IP in an IBM Z or IBM LinuxONE environment

Enabling NBDE disk encryption in an IBM Z&#174; or IBM&#174; LinuxONE environment requires additional steps, which are described in detail in this section.

* You have set up the External Tang Server. See Network-bound disk encryption for instructions.
* You have installed the butane utility.
* You have reviewed the instructions for how to create machine configs with Butane.

1. Create Butane configuration files for the control plane and compute nodes.

The following example of a Butane configuration for a control plane node creates a file named master-storage.bu for disk encryption:

```yaml
variant: openshift
version: 4.15.0
metadata:
  name: master-storage
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: master
storage:
  luks:
    - clevis:
        tang:
          - thumbprint: QcPr_NHFJammnRCA3fFMVdNBwjs
            url: http://clevis.example.com:7500
        options: 1
           - --cipher
           - aes-cbc-essiv:sha256
      device: /dev/disk/by-partlabel/root 2
      label: luks-root
      name: root
      wipe_volume: true
  filesystems:
    - device: /dev/mapper/root
      format: xfs
      label: root
      wipe_filesystem: true
openshift:
  fips: true 3
```

The cipher option is only required if FIPS mode is enabled. Omit the entry if FIPS is disabled.
For installations on DASD-type disks, replace with device: /dev/disk/by-label/root.
Whether to enable or disable FIPS mode. By default, FIPS mode is not enabled. If FIPS mode is enabled, the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform runs on bypass the default Kubernetes cryptography suite and use the cryptography modules that are provided with RHCOS instead.
2. Create a customized initramfs file to boot the machine, by running the following command:

```terminal
$ coreos-installer pxe customize \
    /root/rhcos-bootfiles/rhcos-<release>-live-initramfs.s390x.img \
    --dest-device /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-<serial_number> --dest-karg-append \
    ip=<ip_address>::<gateway_ip>:<subnet_mask>::<network_device>:none \
    --dest-karg-append nameserver=<nameserver_ip> \
    --dest-karg-append rd.neednet=1 -o \
    /root/rhcos-bootfiles/<node_name>-initramfs.s390x.img
```


[NOTE]
----
Before first boot, you must customize the initramfs for each node in the cluster, and add PXE kernel parameters.
----
3. Create a parameter file that includes ignition.platform.id=metal and ignition.firstboot.
Example kernel parameter file for the control plane machine:

```terminal
rd.neednet=1 \
console=ttysclp0 \
coreos.inst.install_dev=/dev/dasda \1
ignition.firstboot ignition.platform.id=metal \
coreos.live.rootfs_url=http://<http_server>/rhcos-<version>-live-rootfs.<architecture>.img \2
coreos.inst.ignition_url=http://<http_server>/master.ign \3
ip=10.19.17.2::10.19.17.1:255.255.255.0::enbdd0:none nameserver=10.19.17.1 \

# Installing RHCOS and starting the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform bootstrap process

To install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on IBM Z&#174; infrastructure that you provision, you must install Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) on z/VM guest virtual machines. When you install RHCOS, you must provide the Ignition config file that was generated by the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program for the type of machine you are installing. If you have configured suitable networking, DNS, and load balancing infrastructure, the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform bootstrap process begins automatically after the RHCOS z/VM guest virtual machines have rebooted.

Complete the following steps to create the machines.

* An HTTP or HTTPS server running on your provisioning machine that is accessible to the machines you create.

1. Log in to Linux on your provisioning machine.
2. Obtain the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) kernel, initramfs, and rootfs files from the RHCOS image mirror.

[IMPORTANT]
----
The RHCOS images might not change with every release of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
You must download images with the highest version that is less than or equal
to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version that you install. Only use the appropriate kernel, initramfs, and rootfs artifacts described in the following procedure.
----

The file names contain the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version number. They resemble the following examples:
* kernel: rhcos-<version>-live-kernel-<architecture>
* initramfs: rhcos-<version>-live-initramfs.<architecture>.img
* rootfs: rhcos-<version>-live-rootfs.<architecture>.img

[NOTE]
----
The rootfs image is the same for FCP and DASD.
----
3. Create parameter files. The following parameters are specific for a particular virtual machine:
* For ip=, specify the following seven entries:
1. The IP address for the machine.
2. An empty string.
3. The gateway.
4. The netmask.
5. The machine host and domain name in the form hostname.domainname. If you omit this value, RHCOS obtains the hostname through a reverse DNS lookup.
6. The network interface name. If you omit this value, RHCOS applies the IP configuration to all available interfaces.
7. If you use static IP addresses, specify none.
* For coreos.inst.ignition_url=, specify the Ignition file for the machine role. Use bootstrap.ign, master.ign, or worker.ign. Only HTTP and HTTPS protocols are supported.
* For coreos.live.rootfs_url=, specify the matching rootfs artifact for the kernel and initramfs you are booting. Only HTTP and HTTPS protocols are supported.
* For installations on DASD-type disks, complete the following tasks:
1. For coreos.inst.install_dev=, specify /dev/dasda.
2. Use rd.dasd= to specify the DASD where RHCOS is to be installed.
3. Leave all other parameters unchanged.

Example parameter file, bootstrap-0.parm, for the bootstrap machine:

```terminal
rd.neednet=1 \
console=ttysclp0 \
coreos.inst.install_dev=/dev/dasda \
coreos.live.rootfs_url=http://cl1.provide.example.com:8080/assets/rhcos-live-rootfs.s390x.img \
coreos.inst.ignition_url=http://cl1.provide.example.com:8080/ignition/bootstrap.ign \
ip=172.18.78.2::172.18.78.1:255.255.255.0:::none nameserver=172.18.78.1 \
rd.znet=qeth,0.0.bdf0,0.0.bdf1,0.0.bdf2,layer2=1,portno=0 \
zfcp.allow_lun_scan=0 \
rd.dasd=0.0.3490
```


Write all options in the parameter file as a single line and make sure you have no newline characters.
* For installations on FCP-type disks, complete the following tasks:
1. Use rd.zfcp=<adapter>,<wwpn>,<lun> to specify the FCP disk where RHCOS is to be installed. For multipathing repeat this step for each additional path.

[NOTE]
----
When you install with multiple paths, you must enable multipathing directly after the installation, not at a later point in time, as this can cause problems.
----
2. Set the install device as: coreos.inst.install_dev=/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-<serial_number>.

[NOTE]
----
If additional LUNs are configured with NPIV, FCP requires zfcp.allow_lun_scan=0. If you must enable zfcp.allow_lun_scan=1 because you use a CSI driver, for example, you must configure your NPIV so that each node cannot access the boot partition of another node.
----
3. Leave all other parameters unchanged.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Additional postinstallation steps are required to fully enable multipathing. For more information, see “Enabling multipathing with kernel arguments on RHCOS" in Postinstallation machine configuration tasks.
----

The following is an example parameter file worker-1.parm for a worker node with multipathing:

```terminal
rd.neednet=1 \
console=ttysclp0 \
coreos.inst.install_dev=/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-<serial_number> \
coreos.live.rootfs_url=http://cl1.provide.example.com:8080/assets/rhcos-live-rootfs.s390x.img \
coreos.inst.ignition_url=http://cl1.provide.example.com:8080/ignition/worker.ign \
ip=172.18.78.2::172.18.78.1:255.255.255.0:::none nameserver=172.18.78.1 \
rd.znet=qeth,0.0.bdf0,0.0.bdf1,0.0.bdf2,layer2=1,portno=0 \
zfcp.allow_lun_scan=0 \
rd.zfcp=0.0.1987,0x50050763070bc5e3,0x4008400B00000000 \
rd.zfcp=0.0.19C7,0x50050763070bc5e3,0x4008400B00000000 \
rd.zfcp=0.0.1987,0x50050763071bc5e3,0x4008400B00000000 \
rd.zfcp=0.0.19C7,0x50050763071bc5e3,0x4008400B00000000
```


Write all options in the parameter file as a single line and make sure you have no newline characters.
4. Transfer the initramfs, kernel, parameter files, and RHCOS images to z/VM, for example with FTP. For details about how to transfer the files with FTP and boot from the virtual reader, see Installing under Z/VM.
5. Punch the files to the virtual reader of the z/VM guest virtual machine that is to become your bootstrap node.

See PUNCH in IBM Documentation.

[TIP]
----
You can use the CP PUNCH command or, if you use Linux, the vmur command to transfer files between two z/VM guest virtual machines.
----
6. Log in to CMS on the bootstrap machine.
7. IPL the bootstrap machine from the reader:

```
$ ipl c
```


See IPL in IBM Documentation.
8. Repeat this procedure for the other machines in the cluster.

## Advanced RHCOS installation reference

This section illustrates the networking configuration and other advanced options that allow you to modify the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) manual installation process. The following tables describe the kernel arguments and command-line options you can use with the RHCOS live installer and the coreos-installer command.

### Networking and bonding options for ISO installations

If you install RHCOS from an ISO image, you can add kernel arguments manually when you boot the image to configure networking for a node. If no networking arguments are specified, DHCP is activated in the initramfs when RHCOS detects that networking is required to fetch the Ignition config file.


[IMPORTANT]
----
When adding networking arguments manually, you must also add the rd.neednet=1 kernel argument to bring the network up in the initramfs.
----

The following information provides examples for configuring networking and bonding on your RHCOS nodes for ISO installations. The examples describe how to use the ip=, nameserver=, and bond= kernel arguments.


[NOTE]
----
Ordering is important when adding the kernel arguments: ip=, nameserver=, and then bond=.
----

The networking options are passed to the dracut tool during system boot. For more information about the networking options supported by dracut, see the dracut.cmdline manual page.

The following examples are the networking options for ISO installation.

## Configuring DHCP or static IP addresses

To configure an IP address, either use DHCP (ip=dhcp) or set an individual static IP address (ip=<host_ip>). If setting a static IP, you must then identify the DNS server IP address (nameserver=<dns_ip>) on each node. The following example sets:

* The node's IP address to 10.10.10.2
* The gateway address to 10.10.10.254
* The netmask to 255.255.255.0
* The hostname to core0.example.com
* The DNS server address to 4.4.4.41
* The auto-configuration value to none. No auto-configuration is required when IP networking is configured statically.


```terminal
ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:enp1s0:none
nameserver=4.4.4.41
```



[NOTE]
----
When you use DHCP to configure IP addressing for the RHCOS machines, the machines also obtain the DNS server information through DHCP. For DHCP-based deployments, you can define the DNS server address that is used by the RHCOS nodes through your DHCP server configuration.
----

## Configuring an IP address without a static hostname

You can configure an IP address without assigning a static hostname. If a static hostname is not set by the user, it will be picked up and automatically set by a reverse DNS lookup. To configure an IP address without a static hostname refer to the following example:

* The node's IP address to 10.10.10.2
* The gateway address to 10.10.10.254
* The netmask to 255.255.255.0
* The DNS server address to 4.4.4.41
* The auto-configuration value to none. No auto-configuration is required when IP networking is configured statically.


```terminal
ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0::enp1s0:none
nameserver=4.4.4.41
```


## Specifying multiple network interfaces

You can specify multiple network interfaces by setting multiple ip= entries.


```terminal
ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:enp1s0:none
ip=10.10.10.3::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:enp2s0:none
```


## Configuring default gateway and route

Optional: You can configure routes to additional networks by setting an rd.route= value.


[NOTE]
----
When you configure one or multiple networks, one default gateway is required. If the additional network gateway is different from the primary network gateway, the default gateway must be the primary network gateway.
----

* Run the following command to configure the default gateway:

```terminal
ip=::10.10.10.254::::
```

* Enter the following command to configure the route for the additional network:

```terminal
rd.route=20.20.20.0/24:20.20.20.254:enp2s0
```


## Disabling DHCP on a single interface

You can disable DHCP on a single interface, such as when there are two or more network interfaces and only one interface is being used. In the example, the enp1s0 interface has a static networking configuration and DHCP is disabled for enp2s0, which is not used:


```terminal
ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:enp1s0:none
ip=::::core0.example.com:enp2s0:none
```


## Combining DHCP and static IP configurations

You can combine DHCP and static IP configurations on systems with multiple network interfaces, for example:


```terminal
ip=enp1s0:dhcp
ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:enp2s0:none
```


## Configuring VLANs on individual interfaces

Optional: You can configure VLANs on individual interfaces by using the vlan= parameter.

* To configure a VLAN on a network interface and use a static IP address, run the following command:

```terminal
ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:enp2s0.100:none
vlan=enp2s0.100:enp2s0
```

* To configure a VLAN on a network interface and to use DHCP, run the following command:

```terminal
ip=enp2s0.100:dhcp
vlan=enp2s0.100:enp2s0
```


## Providing multiple DNS servers

You can provide multiple DNS servers by adding a nameserver= entry for each server, for example:


```terminal
nameserver=1.1.1.1
nameserver=8.8.8.8
```


## Bonding multiple network interfaces to a single interface

Optional: You can bond multiple network interfaces to a single interface by using the bond= option. Refer to the following examples:

* The syntax for configuring a bonded interface is: bond=<name>[:<network_interfaces>][:options]

<name> is the bonding device name (bond0), <network_interfaces> represents a comma-separated list of physical (ethernet) interfaces (em1,em2),
and options is a comma-separated list of bonding options. Enter modinfo bonding to see available options.
* When you create a bonded interface using bond=, you must specify how the IP address is assigned and other
information for the bonded interface.
* To configure the bonded interface to use DHCP, set the bond's IP address to dhcp. For example:

```terminal
bond=bond0:em1,em2:mode=active-backup
ip=bond0:dhcp
```

* To configure the bonded interface to use a static IP address, enter the specific IP address you want and related information. For example:


```terminal
bond=bond0:em1,em2:mode=active-backup,fail_over_mac=1
ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:bond0:none
```


Always set the fail_over_mac=1 option in active-backup mode, to avoid problems when shared OSA/RoCE cards are used.

## Bonding multiple network interfaces to a single interface

Optional: You can configure VLANs on bonded interfaces by using the vlan= parameter and to use DHCP, for example:


```terminal
ip=bond0.100:dhcp
bond=bond0:em1,em2:mode=active-backup
vlan=bond0.100:bond0
```


Use the following example to configure the bonded interface with a VLAN and to use a static IP address:


```terminal
ip=10.10.10.2::10.10.10.254:255.255.255.0:core0.example.com:bond0.100:none
bond=bond0:em1,em2:mode=active-backup
vlan=bond0.100:bond0
```


## Using network teaming

Optional: You can use a network teaming as an alternative to bonding by using the team= parameter:

* The syntax for configuring a team interface is: team=name[:network_interfaces]

name is the team device name (team0) and network_interfaces represents a comma-separated list of physical (ethernet) interfaces (em1, em2).


[NOTE]
----
Teaming is planned to be deprecated when RHCOS switches to an upcoming version of RHEL. For more information, see this Red Hat Knowledgebase Article.
----

Use the following example to configure a network team:


```terminal
team=team0:em1,em2
ip=team0:dhcp
```


# Waiting for the bootstrap process to complete

The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform bootstrap process begins after the cluster nodes first boot into the persistent RHCOS environment that has been installed to disk. The configuration information provided through the Ignition config files is used to initialize the bootstrap process and install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on the machines. You must wait for the bootstrap process to complete.

* You have created the Ignition config files for your cluster.
* You have configured suitable network, DNS and load balancing infrastructure.
* You have obtained the installation program and generated the Ignition config files for your cluster.
* You installed RHCOS on your cluster machines and provided the Ignition config files that the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program generated.

1. Monitor the bootstrap process:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install --dir <installation_directory> wait-for bootstrap-complete \ 1
    --log-level=info 2
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the path to the directory that you stored the installation files in.
To view different installation details, specify warn, debug, or error instead of info.
Example output

```terminal
INFO Waiting up to 30m0s for the Kubernetes API at https://api.test.example.com:6443...
INFO API v1.28.5 up
INFO Waiting up to 30m0s for bootstrapping to complete...
INFO It is now safe to remove the bootstrap resources
```


The command succeeds when the Kubernetes API server signals that it has been
bootstrapped on the control plane machines.
2. After the bootstrap process is complete, remove the bootstrap machine from the
load balancer.

[IMPORTANT]
----
You must remove the bootstrap machine from the load balancer at this point. You
can also remove or reformat the bootstrap machine itself.
----

# Logging in to the cluster by using the CLI

You can log in to your cluster as a default system user by exporting the cluster kubeconfig file.
The kubeconfig file contains information about the cluster that is used by the CLI to connect a client to the correct cluster and API server.
The file is specific to a cluster and is created during Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation.

* You deployed an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* You installed the oc CLI.

1. Export the kubeadmin credentials:

```terminal
$ export KUBECONFIG=<installation_directory>/auth/kubeconfig 1
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the path to the directory that you stored
the installation files in.
2. Verify you can run oc commands successfully using the exported configuration:

```terminal
$ oc whoami
```

Example output

```terminal
system:admin
```


# Approving the certificate signing requests for your machines

When you add machines to a cluster, two pending certificate signing requests (CSRs) are generated for each machine that you added. You must confirm that these CSRs are approved or, if necessary, approve them yourself. The client requests must be approved first, followed by the server requests.

* You added machines to your cluster.

1. Confirm that the cluster recognizes the machines:

```terminal
$ oc get nodes
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME      STATUS    ROLES   AGE  VERSION
master-0  Ready     master  63m  v1.28.5
master-1  Ready     master  63m  v1.28.5
master-2  Ready     master  64m  v1.28.5
```


The output lists all of the machines that you created.

[NOTE]
----
The preceding output might not include the compute nodes, also known as worker nodes, until some CSRs are approved.
----
2. Review the pending CSRs and ensure that you see the client requests with the Pending or Approved status for each machine that you added to the cluster:

```terminal
$ oc get csr
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME        AGE     REQUESTOR                                                                   CONDITION
csr-8b2br   15m     system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Pending
csr-8vnps   15m     system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Pending
...
```


In this example, two machines are joining the cluster. You might see more approved CSRs in the list.
3. If the CSRs were not approved, after all of the pending CSRs for the machines you added are in Pending status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines:

[NOTE]
----
Because the CSRs rotate automatically, approve your CSRs within an hour of adding the machines to the cluster. If you do not approve them within an hour, the certificates will rotate, and more than two certificates will be present for each node. You must approve all of these certificates. After the client CSR is approved, the Kubelet creates a secondary CSR for the serving certificate, which requires manual approval. Then, subsequent serving certificate renewal requests are automatically approved by the machine-approver if the Kubelet requests a new certificate with identical parameters.
----

[NOTE]
----
For clusters running on platforms that are not machine API enabled, such as bare metal and other user-provisioned infrastructure, you must implement a method of automatically approving the kubelet serving certificate requests (CSRs). If a request is not approved, then the oc exec, oc rsh, and oc logs commands cannot succeed, because a serving certificate is required when the API server connects to the kubelet. Any operation that contacts the Kubelet endpoint requires this certificate approval to be in place. The method must watch for new CSRs, confirm that the CSR was submitted by the node-bootstrapper service account in the system:node or system:admin groups, and confirm the identity of the node.
----
* To approve them individually, run the following command for each valid CSR:

```terminal
$ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name> 1
```

<csr_name> is the name of a CSR from the list of current CSRs.
* To approve all pending CSRs, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs --no-run-if-empty oc adm certificate approve
```


[NOTE]
----
Some Operators might not become available until some CSRs are approved.
----
4. Now that your client requests are approved, you must review the server requests for each machine that you added to the cluster:

```terminal
$ oc get csr
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME        AGE     REQUESTOR                                                                   CONDITION
csr-bfd72   5m26s   system:node:ip-10-0-50-126.us-east-2.compute.internal                       Pending
csr-c57lv   5m26s   system:node:ip-10-0-95-157.us-east-2.compute.internal                       Pending
...
```

5. If the remaining CSRs are not approved, and are in the Pending status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines:
* To approve them individually, run the following command for each valid CSR:

```terminal
$ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name> 1
```

<csr_name> is the name of a CSR from the list of current CSRs.
* To approve all pending CSRs, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs oc adm certificate approve
```

6. After all client and server CSRs have been approved, the machines have the Ready status. Verify this by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get nodes
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME      STATUS    ROLES   AGE  VERSION
master-0  Ready     master  73m  v1.28.5
master-1  Ready     master  73m  v1.28.5
master-2  Ready     master  74m  v1.28.5
worker-0  Ready     worker  11m  v1.28.5
worker-1  Ready     worker  11m  v1.28.5
```


[NOTE]
----
It can take a few minutes after approval of the server CSRs for the machines to transition to the Ready status.
----

* For more information on CSRs, see Certificate Signing Requests.

# Initial Operator configuration

After the control plane initializes, you must immediately configure some
Operators so that they all become available.

* Your control plane has initialized.

1. Watch the cluster components come online:

```terminal
$ watch -n5 oc get clusteroperators
```

Example output

```terminal

2. Configure the Operators that are not available.

## Disabling the default OperatorHub catalog sources

Operator catalogs that source content provided by Red Hat and community projects are configured for OperatorHub by default during an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation.
In a restricted network environment, you must disable the default catalogs as a cluster administrator.

* Disable the sources for the default catalogs by adding disableAllDefaultSources: true to the OperatorHub object:

```terminal
$ oc patch OperatorHub cluster --type json \
    -p '[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/disableAllDefaultSources", "value": true}]'
```



[TIP]
----
Alternatively, you can use the web console to manage catalog sources. From the Administration -> Cluster Settings -> Configuration -> OperatorHub page, click the Sources tab, where you can create, update, delete, disable, and enable individual sources.
----

## Image registry storage configuration

The Image Registry Operator is not initially available for platforms that do
not provide default storage. After installation, you must configure your
registry to use storage so that the Registry Operator is made available.

Instructions are shown for configuring a persistent volume, which is required for production clusters. Where applicable, instructions are shown for configuring an empty directory as the storage location, which is available for only non-production clusters.

Additional instructions are provided for allowing the image registry to use block storage types by using the Recreate rollout strategy during upgrades.

### Configuring registry storage for IBM Z

As a cluster administrator, following installation you must configure your
registry to use storage.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You have a cluster
on IBM Z(R).
* You have provisioned persistent storage for your cluster, such as Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform supports ReadWriteOnce access for image registry storage when you have only one replica. ReadWriteOnce access also requires that the registry uses the Recreate rollout strategy. To deploy an image registry that supports high availability with two or more replicas, ReadWriteMany access is required.
----
* Must have 100Gi capacity.

1. To configure your registry to use storage, change the spec.storage.pvc in
the configs.imageregistry/cluster resource.

[NOTE]
----
When you use shared storage, review your security settings to prevent outside access.
----
2. Verify that you do not have a registry pod:

```terminal
$ oc get pod -n openshift-image-registry -l docker-registry=default
```

Example output

```terminal
No resources found in openshift-image-registry namespace
```


[NOTE]
----
If you do have a registry pod in your output, you do not need to continue with this procedure.
----
3. Check the registry configuration:

```terminal
$ oc edit configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io
```

Example output

```yaml
storage:
  pvc:
    claim:
```


Leave the claim field blank to allow the automatic creation of an
image-registry-storage PVC.
4. Check the clusteroperator status:

```terminal
$ oc get clusteroperator image-registry
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME             VERSION              AVAILABLE   PROGRESSING   DEGRADED   SINCE   MESSAGE
image-registry   4.15                 True        False         False      6h50m
```

5. Ensure that your registry is set to managed to enable building and pushing of images.
* Run:

```
$ oc edit configs.imageregistry/cluster
```


Then, change the line

```
managementState: Removed
```


to

```
managementState: Managed
```


### Configuring storage for the image registry in non-production clusters

You must configure storage for the Image Registry Operator. For non-production
clusters, you can set the image registry to an empty directory. If you do so,
all images are lost if you restart the registry.

* To set the image registry storage to an empty directory:

```terminal
$ oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io cluster --type merge --patch '{"spec":{"storage":{"emptyDir":{}}}}'
```


[WARNING]
----
Configure this option for only non-production clusters.
----

If you run this command before the Image Registry Operator initializes its
components, the oc patch command fails with the following error:

```terminal
Error from server (NotFound): configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io "cluster" not found
```


Wait a few minutes and run the command again.

# Completing installation on user-provisioned infrastructure

After you complete the Operator configuration, you can finish installing the
cluster on infrastructure that you provide.

* Your control plane has initialized.
* You have completed the initial Operator configuration.

1. Confirm that all the cluster components are online with the following command:

```terminal
$ watch -n5 oc get clusteroperators
```

Example output

```terminal

```


Alternatively, the following command notifies you when all of the clusters are available. It also retrieves and displays credentials:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install --dir <installation_directory> wait-for install-complete 1
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the path to the directory that you
stored the installation files in.
Example output

```terminal
INFO Waiting up to 30m0s for the cluster to initialize...
```


The command succeeds when the Cluster Version Operator finishes deploying the
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster from Kubernetes API server.

[IMPORTANT]
----
* The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending node-bootstrapper certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for Recovering from expired control plane certificates for more information.
* It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.
----
2. Confirm that the Kubernetes API server is communicating with the pods.
1. To view a list of all pods, use the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get pods --all-namespaces
```

Example output

```terminal
NAMESPACE                         NAME                                            READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE

...
```

2. View the logs for a pod that is listed in the output of the previous command by using the following command:

```terminal
$ oc logs <pod_name> -n <namespace> 1
```

Specify the pod name and namespace, as shown in the output of the previous
command.

If the pod logs display, the Kubernetes API server can communicate with the
cluster machines.
3. For an installation with Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP), additional steps are required to enable multipathing. Do not enable multipathing during installation.

See "Enabling multipathing with kernel arguments on RHCOS" in the Postinstallation machine configuration tasks documentation for more information.
4. Register your cluster on the Cluster registration page.

* How to generate SOSREPORT within Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4 nodes without SSH.

# Next steps

* Customize your cluster.
* If the mirror registry that you used to install your cluster has a trusted CA, add it to the cluster by configuring additional trust stores.
* If necessary, you can opt out of remote health reporting.
* If necessary, see Registering your disconnected cluster
