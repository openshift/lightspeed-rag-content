Installation configuration parameters for IBM Power

Before you deploy an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, you provide a customized install-config.yaml installation configuration file that describes the details for your environment.
Available installation configuration parameters for IBM Power
The following tables specify the required, optional, and IBM Power-specific installation configuration parameters that you can set as part of the installation process.

After installation, you cannot modify these parameters in the install-config.yaml file.
Required configuration parameters
Required installation configuration parameters are described in the following table:
Network configuration parameters
You can customize your installation configuration based on the requirements of your existing network infrastructure. For example, you can expand the IP address block for the cluster network or provide different IP address blocks than the defaults.

If you use the Red Hat OpenShift Networking OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, both IPv4 and IPv6 address families are supported.


If you configure your cluster to use both IP address families, review the following requirements:

Both IP families must use the same network interface for the default gateway.

Both IP families must have the default gateway.

You must specify IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in the same order for all network configuration parameters. For example, in the following configuration IPv4 addresses are listed before IPv6 addresses.


networking:
  clusterNetwork:
  - cidr: 10.128.0.0/14
    hostPrefix: 23
  - cidr: fd00:10:128::/56
    hostPrefix: 64
  serviceNetwork:
  - 172.30.0.0/16
  - fd00:172:16::/112
Globalnet is not supported with Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation disaster recovery solutions. For regional disaster recovery scenarios, ensure that you use a nonoverlapping range of private IP addresses for the cluster and service networks in each cluster.
Optional configuration parameters
Optional installation configuration parameters are described in the following table:
