Expanding the cluster

After deploying an installer-provisioned Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, you can use the following procedures to expand the number of worker nodes. Ensure that each prospective worker node meets the prerequisites.

Expanding the cluster using RedFish Virtual Media involves meeting minimum firmware requirements. See Firmware requirements for installing with virtual media in the Prerequisites section for additional details when expanding the cluster using RedFish Virtual Media.
Preparing the bare metal node
To expand your cluster, you must provide the node with the relevant IP address. This can be done with a static configuration, or with a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration protocol) server. When expanding the cluster using a DHCP server, each node must have a DHCP reservation.

Some administrators prefer to use static IP addresses so that each node's IP address remains constant in the absence of a DHCP server. To configure static IP addresses with NMState, see "Optional: Configuring host network interfaces in the install-config.yaml file" in the "Setting up the environment for an OpenShift installation" section for additional details.
Preparing the bare metal node requires executing the following procedure from the provisioner node.

Get the oc binary:

Power off the bare metal node by using the baseboard management controller (BMC), and ensure it is off.

Retrieve the user name and password of the bare metal node's baseboard management controller. Then, create base64 strings from the user name and password:

Create a configuration file for the bare metal node. Depending on whether you are using a static configuration or a DHCP server, use one of the following example bmh.yaml files, replacing values in the YAML to match your environment:

Create the bare metal node:

Power up and inspect the bare metal node:


See Optional: Configuring host network interfaces in the install-config.yaml file for details on configuring the NMState syntax.

See Automatically scaling machines to the number of available bare metal hosts for details on automatically scaling machines.
Replacing a bare-metal control plane node
Use the following procedure to replace an installer-provisioned Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform control plane node.

If you reuse the BareMetalHost object definition from an existing control plane host, do not leave the externallyProvisioned field set to true.

Existing control plane BareMetalHost objects may have the externallyProvisioned flag set to true if they were provisioned by the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program.
You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

You have taken an etcd backup.


Ensure that the Bare Metal Operator is available:

Remove the old BareMetalHost and Machine objects:

Create the new BareMetalHost object and the secret to store the BMC credentials:

View available BareMetalHost objects:

Create a Machine object:

To view the BareMetalHost objects, run the following command:

After the RHCOS installation, verify that the BareMetalHost is added to the cluster:

Preparing to deploy with Virtual Media on the baremetal network
If the provisioning network is enabled and you want to expand the cluster using Virtual Media on the baremetal network, use the following procedure.

There is an existing cluster with a baremetal network and a provisioning network.


Edit the provisioning custom resource (CR) to enable deploying with Virtual Media on the baremetal network:

If the image URL exists, edit the machineset to use the API VIP address. This step only applies to clusters installed in versions 4.9 or earlier.
Diagnosing a duplicate MAC address when provisioning a new host in the cluster
If the MAC address of an existing bare-metal node in the cluster matches the MAC address of a bare-metal host you are attempting to add to the cluster, the Bare Metal Operator associates the host with the existing node. If the host enrollment, inspection, cleaning, or other Ironic steps fail, the Bare Metal Operator retries the installation continuously. A registration error is displayed for the failed bare-metal host.

You can diagnose a duplicate MAC address by examining the bare-metal hosts that are running in the openshift-machine-api namespace.

Install an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on bare metal.

Install the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI oc.

Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.


To determine whether a bare-metal host that fails provisioning has the same MAC address as an existing node, do the following:

Get the bare-metal hosts running in the openshift-machine-api namespace:

To see more detailed information about the status of the failing host, run the following command replacing <bare_metal_host_name> with the name of the host:
Provisioning the bare metal node
Provisioning the bare metal node requires executing the following procedure from the provisioner node.

Ensure the STATE is available before provisioning the bare metal node.

Get a count of the number of worker nodes.

Get the compute machine set.

Increase the number of worker nodes by one.

Check the status of the bare metal node.

After provisioning completes, ensure the bare metal node is ready.
