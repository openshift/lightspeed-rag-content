Configuring your firewall

If you use a firewall, you must configure it so that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform can access the sites that it requires to function. You must always grant access to some sites, and you grant access to more if you use Red Hat Insights, the Telemetry service, a cloud to host your cluster, and certain build strategies.
Configuring your firewall for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
Before you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, you must configure your firewall to grant access to the sites that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform requires. When using a firewall, make additional configurations to the firewall so that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform can access the sites that it requires to function.

There are no special configuration considerations for services running on only controller nodes compared to worker nodes.

Set the following registry URLs for your firewall's allowlist:

Set your firewall's allowlist to include any site that provides resources for a language or framework that your builds require.

If you do not disable Telemetry, you must grant access to the following URLs to access Red Hat Insights:

Allowlist the following URLs:

Allowlist the following URLs for optional third-party content:

If you use a default Red Hat Network Time Protocol (NTP) server allow the following URLs:
