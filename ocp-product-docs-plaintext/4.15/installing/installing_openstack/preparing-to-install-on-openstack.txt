Preparing to install on OpenStack

You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on OpenStack.
Prerequisites
You reviewed details about the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation and update processes.

You read the documentation on selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users.
Choosing a method to install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on OpenStack
You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on installer-provisioned or user-provisioned infrastructure. The default installation type uses installer-provisioned infrastructure, where the installation program provisions the underlying infrastructure for the cluster. You can also install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on infrastructure that you provision. If you do not use infrastructure that the installation program provisions, you must manage and maintain the cluster resources yourself.

See Installation process for more information about installer-provisioned and user-provisioned installation processes.

Installing a cluster on installer-provisioned infrastructure
You can install a cluster on OpenStack infrastructure that is provisioned by the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program, by using one of the following methods:

Installing a cluster on OpenStack with customizations: You can install a customized cluster on OpenStack. The installation program allows for some customization to be applied at the installation stage. Many other customization options are available post-installation.

Installing a cluster on OpenStack in a restricted network: You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on OpenStack in a restricted or disconnected network by creating an internal mirror of the installation release content. You can use this method to install a cluster that does not require an active internet connection to obtain the software components. You can also use this installation method to ensure that your clusters only use container images that satisfy your organizational controls on external content.
Installing a cluster on user-provisioned infrastructure
You can install a cluster on OpenStack infrastructure that you provision, by using one of the following methods:

Installing a cluster on OpenStack on your own infrastructure: You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on user-provisioned OpenStack infrastructure. By using this installation method, you can integrate your cluster with existing infrastructure and modifications. For installations on user-provisioned infrastructure, you must create all OpenStack resources, like Nova servers, Neutron ports, and security groups. You can use the provided Ansible playbooks to assist with the deployment process.
Scanning OpenStack endpoints for legacy HTTPS certificates
Beginning with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.10, HTTPS certificates must contain subject alternative name (SAN) fields. Run the following script to scan each HTTPS endpoint in a OpenStack catalog for legacy certificates that only contain the CommonName field.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform does not check the underlying OpenStack infrastructure for legacy certificates prior to installation or updates. Use the provided script to check for these certificates yourself. Failing to update legacy certificates prior to installing or updating a cluster will result in cluster dysfunction.
On the machine where you run the script, have the following software:

Populate the machine with OpenStack credentials for the target cloud.


Save the following script to your machine:

Run the script.

Replace any certificates that the script reports as INVALID with certificates that contain SAN fields.


You must replace all legacy HTTPS certificates before you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 or update a cluster to that version. Legacy certificates will be rejected with the following message:

x509: certificate relies on legacy Common Name field, use SANs instead
Scanning OpenStack endpoints for legacy HTTPS certificates manually
Beginning with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.10, HTTPS certificates must contain subject alternative name (SAN) fields. If you do not have access to the prerequisite tools that are listed in "Scanning OpenStack endpoints for legacy HTTPS certificates", perform the following steps to scan each HTTPS endpoint in a OpenStack catalog for legacy certificates that only contain the CommonName field.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform does not check the underlying OpenStack infrastructure for legacy certificates prior to installation or updates. Use the following steps to check for these certificates yourself. Failing to update legacy certificates prior to installing or updating a cluster will result in cluster dysfunction.
On a command line, run the following command to view the URL of OpenStack public endpoints:

For each public endpoint, note the host and the port.

For each endpoint, run the following commands to extract the SAN field of the certificate:


You must replace all legacy HTTPS certificates before you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 or update a cluster to that version. Legacy certificates are rejected with the following message:
