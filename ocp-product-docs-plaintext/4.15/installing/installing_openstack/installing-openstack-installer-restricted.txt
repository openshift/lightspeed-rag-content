Installing a cluster on OpenStack in a restricted network

In "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" {product-version}, you can install a cluster on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) in a restricted network by creating an internal mirror of the installation release content.
Prerequisites
You reviewed details about the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation and update processes.

You read the documentation on selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users.

You verified that "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" {product-version} is compatible with your RHOSP version by using the Supported platforms for OpenShift clusters section. You can also compare platform support across different versions by viewing the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" on RHOSP support matrix.

You created a registry on your mirror host and obtained the imageContentSources data for your version of "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform".

You understand performance and scalability practices for cluster scaling, control plane sizing, and etcd. For more information, see Recommended practices for scaling the cluster.

You have the metadata service enabled in RHOSP.
About installations in restricted networks
In "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" {product-version}, you can perform an installation that does not require an active connection to the internet to obtain software components. Restricted network installations can be completed using installer-provisioned infrastructure or user-provisioned infrastructure, depending on the cloud platform to which you are installing the cluster.

If you choose to perform a restricted network installation on a cloud platform, you still require access to its cloud APIs. Some cloud functions, like Amazon Web Service's Route 53 DNS and IAM services, require internet access. Depending on your network, you might require less internet access for an installation on bare metal hardware, Nutanix, or on VMware vSphere.

To complete a restricted network installation, you must create a registry that mirrors the contents of the OpenShift image registry and contains the installation media. You can create this registry on a mirror host, which can access both the internet and your closed network, or by using other methods that meet your restrictions.

Additional limits
Clusters in restricted networks have the following additional limitations and restrictions:

The ClusterVersion status includes an Unable to retrieve available updates
error.

By default, you cannot use the contents of the Developer Catalog because
you cannot access the required image stream tags.
Resource guidelines for installing "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" on RHOSP
To support an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation, your Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) quota must meet the following requirements:


A cluster might function with fewer than recommended resources, but its performance is not guaranteed.

If RHOSP object storage (Swift) is available and operated by a user account with the swiftoperator role, it is used as the default backend for the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" image registry. In this case, the volume storage requirement is 175 GB. Swift space requirements vary depending on the size of the image registry.
By default, your security group and security group rule quotas might be low. If you encounter problems, run openstack quota set --secgroups 3 --secgroup-rules 60 <project> as an administrator to increase them.
An "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" deployment comprises control plane machines, compute machines, and a bootstrap machine.

Control plane machines
By default, the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation process creates three control plane machines.

Each machine requires:

An instance from the RHOSP quota

A port from the RHOSP quota

A flavor with at least 16 GB memory and 4 vCPUs

At least 100 GB storage space from the RHOSP quota
Compute machines
By default, the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation process creates three compute machines.

Each machine requires:

An instance from the RHOSP quota

A port from the RHOSP quota

A flavor with at least 8 GB memory and 2 vCPUs

At least 100 GB storage space from the RHOSP quota


Compute machines host the applications that you run on "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform"; aim to run as many as you can.
Bootstrap machine
During installation, a bootstrap machine is temporarily provisioned to stand up the control plane. After the production control plane is ready, the bootstrap machine is deprovisioned.

The bootstrap machine requires:

An instance from the RHOSP quota

A port from the RHOSP quota

A flavor with at least 16 GB memory and 4 vCPUs

At least 100 GB storage space from the RHOSP quota
Internet access for "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform"
In "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" {product-version}, you require access to the internet to obtain the images that are necessary to install your cluster.

You must have internet access to:

Access OpenShift Cluster Manager to download the installation program and perform subscription management. If the cluster has internet access and you do not disable Telemetry, that service automatically entitles your cluster.

Access Quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install your cluster.

Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.
Enabling Swift on RHOSP
Swift is operated by a user account with the swiftoperator role. Add the role to an account before you run the installation program.

If the Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) object storage service, commonly known as Swift, is available, "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" uses it as the image registry storage. If it is unavailable, the installation program relies on the RHOSP block storage service, commonly known as Cinder.

If Swift is present and you want to use it, you must enable access to it. If it is not present, or if you do not want to use it, skip this section.
RHOSP 17 sets the rgw_max_attr_size parameter of Ceph RGW to 256 characters. This setting causes issues with uploading container images to the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" registry. You must set the value of rgw_max_attr_size to at least 1024 characters.

Before installation, check if your RHOSP deployment is affected by this problem. If it is, reconfigure Ceph RGW.
You have a RHOSP administrator account on the target environment.

The Swift service is installed.

On Ceph RGW, the account in url option is enabled.


To enable Swift on RHOSP:

As an administrator in the RHOSP CLI, add the swiftoperator role to the account that will access Swift:


Your RHOSP deployment can now use Swift for the image registry.
Defining parameters for the installation program
The "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation program relies on a file that is called clouds.yaml. The file describes Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) configuration parameters, including the project name, log in information, and authorization service URLs.

Create the clouds.yaml file:

If your RHOSP installation uses self-signed certificate authority (CA) certificates for endpoint authentication:

Place the clouds.yaml file in one of the following locations:
Setting OpenStack Cloud Controller Manager options
Optionally, you can edit the OpenStack Cloud Controller Manager (CCM) configuration for your cluster. This configuration controls how "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" interacts with Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP).

For a complete list of configuration parameters, see the "OpenStack Cloud Controller Manager reference guide" page in the "Installing on OpenStack" documentation.

If you have not already generated manifest files for your cluster, generate them by running the following command:

In a text editor, open the cloud-provider configuration manifest file. For example:

Modify the options according to the CCM reference guide.

Save the changes to the file and proceed with installation.
Creating the RHCOS image for restricted network installations
Download the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) image to install "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" on a restricted network Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) environment.

Obtain the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation program. For a restricted network installation, the program is on your mirror registry host.


Log in to the Red Hat Customer Portal's Product Downloads page.

Under Version, select the most recent release of "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" {product-version} for RHEL 8.

Download the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) - OpenStack Image (QCOW) image.

Decompress the image.

Upload the image that you decompressed to a location that is accessible from the bastion server, like Glance. For example:


The image is now available for a restricted installation. Note the image name or location for use in "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" deployment.
Creating the installation configuration file
You can customize the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster you install on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP).

You have the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.
For a restricted network installation, these files are on your mirror host.

You have the imageContentSources values that were generated during mirror registry creation.

You have obtained the contents of the certificate for your mirror registry.

You have retrieved a Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) image and uploaded it to an accessible location.


Create the install-config.yaml file.

In the install-config.yaml file, set the value of platform.openstack.clusterOSImage to the image location or name. For example:

Edit the install-config.yaml file to give the additional information that is required for an installation in a restricted network.

Make any other modifications to the install-config.yaml file that you require.

Back up the install-config.yaml file so that you can use
it to install multiple clusters.


Installation configuration parameters for OpenStack


Configuring the cluster-wide proxy during installation
Production environments can deny direct access to the internet and instead have an HTTP or HTTPS proxy available. You can configure a new "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster to use a proxy by configuring the proxy settings in the install-config.yaml file.

You have an existing install-config.yaml file.

You reviewed the sites that your cluster requires access to and determined whether any of them need to bypass the proxy. By default, all cluster egress traffic is proxied, including calls to hosting cloud provider APIs. You added sites to the Proxy object's spec.noProxy field to bypass the proxy if necessary.


Edit your install-config.yaml file and add the proxy settings. For example:

Save the file and reference it when installing "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform".


The installation program creates a cluster-wide proxy that is named cluster that uses the proxy settings in the provided install-config.yaml file. If no proxy settings are provided, a cluster Proxy object is still created, but it will have a nil spec.

Only the Proxy object named cluster is supported, and no additional proxies can be created.

Generating a key pair for cluster node SSH access
During an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation, you can provide an SSH public key to the installation program. The key is passed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) nodes through their Ignition config files and is used to authenticate SSH access to the nodes. The key is added to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys list for the core user on each node, which enables password-less authentication.

After the key is passed to the nodes, you can use the key pair to SSH in to the RHCOS nodes as the user core. To access the nodes through SSH, the private key identity must be managed by SSH for your local user.

If you want to SSH in to your cluster nodes to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, you must provide the SSH public key during the installation process. The ./openshift-install gather command also requires the SSH public key to be in place on the cluster nodes.

Do not skip this procedure in production environments, where disaster recovery and debugging is required.
You must use a local key, not one that you configured with platform-specific approaches such as AWS key pairs.
If you do not have an existing SSH key pair on your local machine to use for authentication onto your cluster nodes, create one. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

View the public SSH key:

Add the SSH private key identity to the SSH agent for your local user, if it has not already been added. SSH agent management of the key is required for password-less SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes, or if you want to use the ./openshift-install gather command.

Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent:


When you install "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform", provide the SSH public key to the installation program.
Enabling access to the environment
At deployment, all "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" machines are created in a Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP)-tenant network. Therefore, they are not accessible directly in most RHOSP deployments.

You can configure "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" API and application access by using floating IP addresses (FIPs) during installation. You can also complete an installation without configuring FIPs, but the installer will not configure a way to reach the API or applications externally.

Enabling access with floating IP addresses
Create floating IP (FIP) addresses for external access to the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" API and cluster applications.

Using the Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) CLI, create the API FIP:

Using the Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) CLI, create the apps, or Ingress, FIP:

Add records that follow these patterns to your DNS server for the API and Ingress FIPs:

Add the FIPs to the
install-config.yaml
file as the values of the following
parameters:


If you use these values, you must also enter an external network as the value of the platform.openstack.externalNetwork parameter in the install-config.yaml file.

You can make "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" resources available outside of the cluster by assigning a floating IP address and updating your firewall configuration.
Completing installation without floating IP addresses
You can install "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) without providing floating IP addresses.

In the install-config.yaml file, do not define the following parameters:

platform.openstack.ingressFloatingIP

platform.openstack.apiFloatingIP


If you cannot provide an external network, you can also leave platform.openstack.externalNetwork blank. If you do not provide a value for platform.openstack.externalNetwork, a router is not created for you, and, without additional action, the installer will fail to retrieve an image from Glance. You must configure external connectivity on your own.

If you run the installer from a system that cannot reach the cluster API due to a lack of floating IP addresses or name resolution, installation fails. To prevent installation failure in these cases, you can use a proxy network or run the installer from a system that is on the same network as your machines.

You can enable name resolution by creating DNS records for the API and Ingress ports. For example:

api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.  IN  A  <api_port_IP>
*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>. IN  A <ingress_port_IP>
If you do not control the DNS server, you can add the record to your /etc/hosts file. This action makes the API accessible to only you, which is not suitable for production deployment but does allow installation for development and testing.
Deploying the cluster
You can install "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" on a compatible cloud platform.

You can run the create cluster command of the installation program only once, during initial installation.
You have the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.

You have verified that the cloud provider account on your host has the correct permissions to deploy the cluster. An account with incorrect permissions causes the installation process to fail with an error message that displays the missing permissions.


Change to the directory that contains the installation program and initialize the cluster deployment:


When the cluster deployment completes successfully:

The terminal displays directions for accessing your cluster, including a link to the web console and credentials for the kubeadmin user.

Credential information also outputs to <installation_directory>/.openshift_install.log.


Do not delete the installation program or the files that the installation program creates. Both are required to delete the cluster.

INFO Install complete!
INFO To access the cluster as the system:admin user when using 'oc', run 'export KUBECONFIG=/home/myuser/install_dir/auth/kubeconfig'
INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.mycluster.example.com
INFO Login to the console with user: "kubeadmin", and password: "password"
INFO Time elapsed: 36m22s
The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending node-bootstrapper certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for Recovering from expired control plane certificates for more information.

It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.
Verifying cluster status
You can verify your "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster's status during or after installation.

In the cluster environment, export the administrator's kubeconfig file:

Logging in to the cluster by using the CLI
You can log in to your cluster as a default system user by exporting the cluster kubeconfig file. The kubeconfig file contains information about the cluster that is used by the CLI to connect a client to the correct cluster and API server. The file is specific to a cluster and is created during "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation.

You deployed an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster.

You installed the oc CLI.


Export the kubeadmin credentials:

Verify you can run oc commands successfully using the exported configuration:


See Accessing the web console for more details about accessing and understanding the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" web console.
Disabling the default OperatorHub catalog sources
Operator catalogs that source content provided by Red Hat and community projects are configured for OperatorHub by default during an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation. In a restricted network environment, you must disable the default catalogs as a cluster administrator.

Disable the sources for the default catalogs by adding disableAllDefaultSources: true to the OperatorHub object:


Alternatively, you can use the web console to manage catalog sources. From the Administration -> Cluster Settings -> Configuration -> OperatorHub page, click the Sources tab, where you can create, update, delete, disable, and enable individual sources.
Telemetry access for "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform"
In "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" {product-version}, the Telemetry service, which runs by default to provide metrics about cluster health and the success of updates, requires internet access. If your cluster is connected to the internet, Telemetry runs automatically, and your cluster is registered to OpenShift Cluster Manager.

After you confirm that your OpenShift Cluster Manager inventory is correct, either maintained automatically by Telemetry or manually by using OpenShift Cluster Manager, use subscription watch to track your "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" subscriptions at the account or multi-cluster level.

See About remote health monitoring for more information about the Telemetry service
