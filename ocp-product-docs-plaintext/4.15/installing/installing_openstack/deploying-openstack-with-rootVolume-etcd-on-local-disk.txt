Deploying on OpenStack with rootVolume and etcd on local disk

Deploying on OpenStack with rootVolume and etcd on local disk is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
As a day 2 operation, you can resolve and prevent performance issues of your OpenStack installation by moving etcd from a root volume (provided by OpenStack Cinder) to a dedicated ephemeral local disk.
Deploying OpenStack on local disk
If you have an existing OpenStack cloud, you can move etcd from that cloud to a dedicated ephemeral local disk.

This procedure is for testing etcd on a local disk only and should not be used on production clusters. In certain cases, complete loss of the control plane can occur. For more information, see "Overview of backup and restore operation" under "Backup and restore".
You have an OpenStack cloud with a working Cinder.

Your OpenStack cloud has at least 75 GB of available storage to accommodate 3 root volumes for the OpenShift control plane.

The OpenStack cloud is deployed with Nova ephemeral storage that uses a local storage backend and not rbd.


Create a Nova flavor for the control plane with at least 10 GB of ephemeral disk by running the following command, replacing the values for --ram, --disk, and <flavor_name> based on your environment:

Deploy a cluster with root volumes for the control plane; for example:

Deploy the cluster you created by running the following command:

Verify that the cluster you deployed is healthy before proceeding to the next step by running the following command:

Edit the ControlPlaneMachineSet (CPMS) to add the additional block ephemeral device that is used by etcd by running the following command:

Verify that the control plane machines are healthy by using the following steps:

Create a file named 98-var-lib-etcd.yaml by using the following YAML file:

Create the new MachineConfig object by running the following command:

Verify that the etcd databases has been transferred to the local disk of each control plane by running the following commands:
