Uninstalling a cluster on RHOSP from your own infrastructure

You can remove a cluster that you deployed to Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) on user-provisioned infrastructure.
Downloading playbook dependencies
The Ansible playbooks that simplify the removal process on user-provisioned infrastructure require several Python modules. On the machine where you will run the process, add the modules' repositories and then download them.

These instructions assume that you are using Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.
Python 3 is installed on your machine.


On a command line, add the repositories:

Install the modules:

Ensure that the python command points to python3:
Removing a cluster from RHOSP that uses your own infrastructure
You can remove an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) that uses your own infrastructure. To complete the removal process quickly, run several Ansible playbooks.

Python 3 is installed on your machine.

You downloaded the modules in "Downloading playbook dependencies."

You have the playbooks that you used to install the cluster.

You modified the playbooks that are prefixed with down- to reflect any changes that you made to their corresponding installation playbooks. For example, changes to the bootstrap.yaml file are reflected in the down-bootstrap.yaml file.

All of the playbooks are in a common directory.


On a command line, run the playbooks that you downloaded:

Remove any DNS record changes you made for the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation.


"Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" is removed from your infrastructure.
