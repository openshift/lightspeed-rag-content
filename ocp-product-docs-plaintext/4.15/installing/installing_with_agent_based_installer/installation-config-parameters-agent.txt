# Installation configuration parameters for the Agent-based Installer


Before you deploy an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster using the Agent-based Installer, you provide parameters to customize your cluster and the platform that hosts it.
When you create the install-config.yaml and agent-config.yaml files, you must provide values for the required parameters, and you can use the optional parameters to customize your cluster further.

# Available installation configuration parameters

The following tables specify the required and optional installation configuration parameters that you can set as part of the Agent-based installation process.

These values are specified in the install-config.yaml file.


[NOTE]
----
These settings are used for installation only, and cannot be modified after installation.

## Required configuration parameters

Required installation configuration parameters are described in the following table:



## Network configuration parameters

You can customize your installation configuration based on the requirements of your existing network infrastructure. For example, you can expand the IP address block for the cluster network or provide different IP address blocks than the defaults.

* If you use the Red Hat OpenShift Networking OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, both IPv4 and IPv6 address families are supported.

If you configure your cluster to use both IP address families, review the following requirements:

* Both IP families must use the same network interface for the default gateway.
* Both IP families must have the default gateway.
* You must specify IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in the same order for all network configuration parameters. For example, in the following configuration IPv4 addresses are listed before IPv6 addresses.


```yaml
networking:
  clusterNetwork:
  - cidr: 10.128.0.0/14
    hostPrefix: 23
  - cidr: fd00:10:128::/56
    hostPrefix: 64
  serviceNetwork:
  - 172.30.0.0/16
  - fd00:172:16::/112
```



[NOTE]
----
Globalnet is not supported with Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation disaster recovery solutions. For regional disaster recovery scenarios, ensure that you use a nonoverlapping range of private IP addresses for the cluster and service networks in each cluster.

## Optional configuration parameters

Optional installation configuration parameters are described in the following table:



1. Not all CCO modes are supported for all cloud providers. For more information about CCO modes, see the "Managing cloud provider credentials" entry in the Authentication and authorization content.

## Additional bare metal configuration parameters for the Agent-based Installer

Additional bare metal installation configuration parameters for the Agent-based Installer are described in the following table:


[NOTE]
----
These fields are not used during the initial provisioning of the cluster, but they are available to use once the cluster has been installed.
Configuring these fields at install time eliminates the need to set them as a Day 2 operation.
----



## Additional VMware vSphere configuration parameters

Additional VMware vSphere configuration parameters are described in the following table:



## Deprecated VMware vSphere configuration parameters

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.13, the following vSphere configuration parameters are deprecated. You can continue to use these parameters, but the installation program does not automatically specify these parameters in the install-config.yaml file.

The following table lists each deprecated vSphere configuration parameter:



* BMC addressing
* Configuring regions and zones for a VMware vCenter

# Available Agent configuration parameters

The following tables specify the required and optional Agent configuration parameters that you can set as part of the Agent-based installation process.

These values are specified in the agent-config.yaml file.


[NOTE]
----
These settings are used for installation only, and cannot be modified after installation.

## Required configuration parameters

Required Agent configuration parameters are described in the following table:



## Optional configuration parameters

Optional Agent configuration parameters are described in the following table:



* Preparing PXE assets for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
* Root device hints
