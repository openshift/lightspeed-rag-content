Installing a cluster on Alibaba Cloud into an existing VPC

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.15, you can install a cluster into an existing Alibaba Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on Alibaba Cloud Services. The installation program provisions the required infrastructure, which can then be customized. To customize the VPC installation, modify the parameters in the 'install-config.yaml' file before you install the cluster.

The scope of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation configurations is intentionally narrow. It is designed for simplicity and ensured success. You can complete many more Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform configuration tasks after an installation completes.
Alibaba Cloud on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
Prerequisites
You reviewed details about the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation and update processes.

You read the documentation on selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users.

You registered your domain.

If you use a firewall, you configured it to allow the sites that your cluster requires access to.

If the cloud Resource Access Management (RAM) APIs are not accessible in your environment, or if you do not want to store an administrator-level credential secret in the kube-system namespace, you can manually create and maintain Resource Access Management (RAM) credentials.
Using a custom VPC
In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15, you can deploy a cluster into existing subnets in an existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in the Alibaba Cloud Platform. By deploying Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform into an existing Alibaba VPC, you can avoid limit constraints in new accounts and more easily adhere to your organization's operational constraints. If you cannot obtain the infrastructure creation permissions that are required to create the VPC yourself, use this installation option. You must configure networking using vSwitches.

Requirements for using your VPC
The union of the VPC CIDR block and the machine network CIDR must be non-empty. The vSwitches must be within the machine network.

The installation program does not create the following components:

VPC

vSwitches

Route table

NAT gateway


The installation program requires that you use the cloud-provided DNS server. Using a custom DNS server is not supported and causes the installation to fail.
VPC validation
To ensure that the vSwitches you provide are suitable, the installation program confirms the following data:

All the vSwitches that you specify must exist.

You have provided one or more vSwitches for control plane machines and compute machines.

The vSwitches' CIDRs belong to the machine CIDR that you specified.
Division of permissions
Some individuals can create different resources in your cloud than others. For example, you might be able to create application-specific items, like instances, buckets, and load balancers, but not networking-related components, such as VPCs or vSwitches.
Isolation between clusters
If you deploy Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform into an existing network, the isolation of cluster services is reduced in the following ways:

You can install multiple Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters in the same VPC.

ICMP ingress is allowed to the entire network.

TCP 22 ingress (SSH) is allowed to the entire network.

Control plane TCP 6443 ingress (Kubernetes API) is allowed to the entire network.

Control plane TCP 22623 ingress (MCS) is allowed to the entire network.
Internet access for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15, you require access to the internet to install your cluster.

You must have internet access to:

Access https://console.redhat.com/openshift [OpenShift Cluster Manager Hybrid Cloud Console] to download the installation program and perform subscription management. If the cluster has internet access and you do not disable Telemetry, that service automatically entitles your cluster.

Access Quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install your cluster.

Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.
Generating a key pair for cluster node SSH access
During an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation, you can provide an SSH public key to the installation program. The key is passed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) nodes through their Ignition config files and is used to authenticate SSH access to the nodes. The key is added to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys list for the core user on each node, which enables password-less authentication.

After the key is passed to the nodes, you can use the key pair to SSH in to the RHCOS nodes as the user core. To access the nodes through SSH, the private key identity must be managed by SSH for your local user.

If you want to SSH in to your cluster nodes to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, you must provide the SSH public key during the installation process. The ./openshift-install gather command also requires the SSH public key to be in place on the cluster nodes.

Do not skip this procedure in production environments, where disaster recovery and debugging is required.
You must use a local key, not one that you configured with platform-specific approaches such as AWS key pairs.
If you do not have an existing SSH key pair on your local machine to use for authentication onto your cluster nodes, create one. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

View the public SSH key:

Add the SSH private key identity to the SSH agent for your local user, if it has not already been added. SSH agent management of the key is required for password-less SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes, or if you want to use the ./openshift-install gather command.

Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent:


When you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, provide the SSH public key to the installation program.
Obtaining the installation program
Before you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, download the installation file on  the host you are using for installation.

You have a computer that runs Linux or macOS, with 500 MB of local disk space.


Access the Infrastructure Provider page on the OpenShift Cluster Manager site. If you have a Red Hat account, log in with your credentials. If you do not, create an account.

Select your infrastructure provider.

Navigate to the page for your installation type, download the installation program that corresponds with your host operating system and architecture, and place the file in the directory where you will store the installation configuration files.

Extract the installation program. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux
operating system, run the following command:

Download your installation https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret [pull secret from the Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager]. This pull secret allows you to authenticate with the services that are provided by the included authorities, including Quay.io, which serves the container images for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform components.


Creating the installation configuration file
You can customize the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster you install on Alibaba Cloud.

You have the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.


Create the install-config.yaml file.

Installing the cluster into Alibaba Cloud requires that the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) operate in manual mode. Modify the install-config.yaml file to set the credentialsMode parameter to Manual:

Modify the install-config.yaml file. You can find more information about the available parameters in the "Installation configuration parameters" section.

Back up the install-config.yaml file so that you can use
it to install multiple clusters.

Generating the required installation manifests
You must generate the Kubernetes manifest and Ignition config files that the cluster needs to configure the machines.

Generate the manifests by running the following command from the directory that contains the installation program:
Configuring the Cloud Credential Operator utility
To create and manage cloud credentials from outside of the cluster when the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) is operating in manual mode, extract and prepare the CCO utility (ccoctl) binary.

The ccoctl utility is a Linux binary that must run in a Linux environment.
You have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform account with cluster administrator access.

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).


Obtain the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:

Obtain the CCO container image from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:

Extract the ccoctl binary from the CCO container image within the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:

Change the permissions to make ccoctl executable by running the following command:


To verify that ccoctl is ready to use, display the help file by running the following command:
Creating credentials for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform components with the ccoctl tool
You can use the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) utility to automate the creation of Alibaba Cloud RAM users and policies for each in-cluster component.

By default, ccoctl creates objects in the directory in which the commands are run. To create the objects in a different directory, use the --output-dir flag. This procedure uses <path_to_ccoctl_output_dir> to refer to this directory.
You must have:

Extracted and prepared the ccoctl binary.

Created a RAM user with sufficient permission to create the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

Added the AccessKeyID (access_key_id) and AccessKeySecret (access_key_secret) of that RAM user into the ~/.alibabacloud/credentials file on your local computer.


Set a $RELEASE_IMAGE variable with the release image from your installation file by running the following command:

Extract the list of CredentialsRequest objects from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:

Use the ccoctl tool to process all CredentialsRequest objects by running the following command:

Copy the generated credential files to the target manifests directory:
Deploying the cluster
You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on a compatible cloud platform.

You can run the create cluster command of the installation program only once, during initial installation.
You have configured an account with the cloud platform that hosts your cluster.

You have the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.

You have verified that the cloud provider account on your host has the correct permissions to deploy the cluster. An account with incorrect permissions causes the installation process to fail with an error message that displays the missing permissions.


Change to the directory that contains the installation program and initialize the cluster deployment:


When the cluster deployment completes successfully:

The terminal displays directions for accessing your cluster, including a link to the web console and credentials for the kubeadmin user.

Credential information also outputs to <installation_directory>/.openshift_install.log.


Do not delete the installation program or the files that the installation program creates. Both are required to delete the cluster.

INFO Login to the console with user: "kubeadmin", and password: "password"
INFO Time elapsed: 36m22s
The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending node-bootstrapper certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for Recovering from expired control plane certificates for more information.

It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.
Installing the OpenShift CLI by downloading the binary
You can install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) to interact with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform from a command-line interface. You can install oc on Linux, Windows, or macOS.

If you installed an earlier version of oc, you cannot use it to complete all of the commands in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15. Download and install the new version of oc.
