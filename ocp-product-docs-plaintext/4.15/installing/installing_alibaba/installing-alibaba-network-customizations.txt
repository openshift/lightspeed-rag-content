# Installing a cluster on Alibaba Cloud with network customizations


In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15, you can install a cluster on Alibaba Cloud with customized network configuration options. By customizing your network configuration, your cluster can coexist with existing IP address allocations in your environment and integrate with existing MTU and
VXLAN configurations.
You must set most of the network configuration parameters during installation, and you can modify only kubeProxy configuration parameters in a running cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Alibaba Cloud on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
----

# Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation and update processes.
* You read the documentation on selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users.
* You registered your domain.
* If you use a firewall, you configured it to allow the sites that your cluster requires access to.
* If the cloud Resource Access Management (RAM) APIs are not accessible in your environment, or if you do not want to store an administrator-level credential secret in the kube-system namespace, you can manually create and maintain Resource Access Management (RAM) credentials.

# Internet access for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15, you require access to the internet to
install
your cluster.

You must have internet access to:

* Access https://console.redhat.com/openshift [OpenShift Cluster Manager] to download the installation program and perform subscription management. If the cluster has internet access and you do not disable Telemetry, that service automatically entitles your cluster.
* Access Quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install your cluster.
* Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.

# Generating a key pair for cluster node SSH access

During an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation, you can provide an SSH public key to the installation program. The key is passed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) nodes through their Ignition config files and is used to authenticate SSH access to the nodes. The key is added to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys list for the core user on each node, which enables password-less authentication.

After the key is passed to the nodes, you can use the key pair to SSH in to the RHCOS nodes as the user core. To access the nodes through SSH, the private key identity must be managed by SSH for your local user.

If you want to SSH in to your cluster nodes to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, you must provide the SSH public key during the installation process. The ./openshift-install gather command also requires the SSH public key to be in place on the cluster nodes.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not skip this procedure in production environments, where disaster recovery and debugging is required.
----


[NOTE]
----
You must use a local key, not one that you configured with platform-specific
approaches such as
AWS key pairs.
----

1. If you do not have an existing SSH key pair on your local machine to use for authentication onto your cluster nodes, create one. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

```terminal
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N '' -f <path>/<file_name> 1
```

Specify the path and file name, such as ~/.ssh/id_ed25519, of the new SSH key. If you have an existing key pair, ensure your public key is in the your ~/.ssh directory.

[NOTE]
----
If you plan to install an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster that uses the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures, do not create a key that uses the ed25519 algorithm. Instead, create a key that uses the rsa or ecdsa algorithm.
----
2. View the public SSH key:

```terminal
$ cat <path>/<file_name>.pub
```


For example, run the following to view the ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub public key:

```terminal
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

3. Add the SSH private key identity to the SSH agent for your local user, if it has not already been added. SSH agent management of the key is required for password-less SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes, or if you want to use the ./openshift-install gather command.

[NOTE]
----
On some distributions, default SSH private key identities such as ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_dsa are managed automatically.
----
1. If the ssh-agent process is not already running for your local user, start it as a background task:

```terminal
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

Example output

```terminal
Agent pid 31874
```


[NOTE]
----
If your cluster is in FIPS mode, only use FIPS-compliant algorithms to generate the SSH key. The key must be either RSA or ECDSA.
----
4. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent:

```terminal
$ ssh-add <path>/<file_name> 1
```

Specify the path and file name for your SSH private key, such as ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
Example output

```terminal
Identity added: /home/<you>/<path>/<file_name> (<computer_name>)
```


* When you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, provide the SSH public key to the installation program.

# Obtaining the installation program

Before you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, download the installation file on
 the host you are using for installation.

* You have a computer that runs Linux or macOS, with at least 1.2 GB of local disk space.

1. Go to the Cluster Type page on the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console. If you have a Red Hat account, log in with your credentials. If you do not, create an account.
2. Select your infrastructure provider from the Run it yourself section of the page.
3. Select your host operating system and architecture from the dropdown menus under OpenShift Installer and click Download Installer.
4. Place the downloaded file in the directory where you want to store the installation configuration files.

[IMPORTANT]
----
* The installation program creates several files on the computer that you use to install your cluster. You must keep the installation program and the files that the installation program creates after you finish installing the cluster. Both of the files are required to delete the cluster.
* Deleting the files created by the installation program does not remove your cluster, even if the cluster failed during installation. To remove your cluster, complete the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform uninstallation procedures for your specific cloud provider.
----
5. Extract the installation program. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

```terminal
$ tar -xvf openshift-install-linux.tar.gz
```

6. Download your installation https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret [pull secret from Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager]. This pull secret allows you to authenticate with the services that are provided by the included authorities, including Quay.io, which serves the container images for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform components.


[TIP]
----
Alternatively, you can retrieve the installation program from the Red Hat Customer Portal, where you can specify a version of the installation program to download.
However, you must have an active subscription to access this page.
----

# Network configuration phases

There are two phases prior to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation where you can customize the network configuration.

Phase 1:: You can customize the following network-related fields in the install-config.yaml file before you create the manifest files:
* networking.networkType
* networking.clusterNetwork
* networking.serviceNetwork
* networking.machineNetwork

For more information on these fields, refer to Installation configuration parameters.

[NOTE]
----
Set the networking.machineNetwork to match the CIDR that the preferred NIC resides in.
----

[IMPORTANT]
----
The CIDR range 172.17.0.0/16 is reserved by libVirt. You cannot use this range or any range that overlaps with this range for any networks in your cluster.
----
Phase 2:: After creating the manifest files by running openshift-install create manifests, you can define a customized Cluster Network Operator manifest with only the fields you want to modify. You can use the manifest to specify advanced network configuration.

You cannot override the values specified in phase 1 in the install-config.yaml file during phase 2. However, you can further customize the network plugin during phase 2.

## Creating the installation configuration file

You can customize the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster you install on

* You have the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.

1. Create the install-config.yaml file.
1. Change to the directory that contains the installation program and run the following command:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install create install-config --dir <installation_directory> 1
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the directory name to store the
files that the installation program creates.

When specifying the directory:
* Verify that the directory has the execute permission. This permission is required to run Terraform binaries under the installation directory.
* Use an empty directory. Some installation assets, such as bootstrap X.509 certificates, have short expiration intervals, therefore you must not reuse an installation directory. If you want to reuse individual files from another cluster installation, you can copy them into your directory. However, the file names for the installation assets might change between releases. Use caution when copying installation files from an earlier Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version.
2. At the prompts, provide the configuration details for your cloud:
1. Optional: Select an SSH key to use to access your cluster machines.

[NOTE]
----
For production Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your ssh-agent process uses.
----
2. Enter a descriptive name for your cluster.
2. Modify the install-config.yaml file. You can find more information about the available parameters in the "Installation configuration parameters" section.
3. Back up the install-config.yaml file so that you can use
it to install multiple clusters.

[IMPORTANT]
----
The install-config.yaml file is consumed during the installation process. If
you want to reuse the file, you must back it up now.
----

* Installation configuration parameters for Alibaba Cloud

## Generating the required installation manifests

You must generate the Kubernetes manifest and Ignition config files that the cluster needs to configure the machines.

1. Generate the manifests by running the following command from the directory that contains the installation program:

```terminal
$ openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory>
```


where:
<installation_directory>:: Specifies the directory in which the installation program creates files.


[NOTE]
----
By default, ccoctl creates objects in the directory in which the commands are run. To create the objects in a different directory, use the --output-dir flag. This procedure uses <path_to_ccoctl_output_dir> to refer to this directory.
----

You must have:

* Extracted and prepared the ccoctl binary.

1. Set a $RELEASE_IMAGE variable with the release image from your installation file by running the following command:

```terminal
$ RELEASE_IMAGE=$(./openshift-install version | awk '/release image/ {print $3}')
```

2. Extract the list of CredentialsRequest objects from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc adm release extract \
  --from=$RELEASE_IMAGE \
  --credentials-requests \
  --included \1
  --install-config=<path_to_directory_with_installation_configuration>/install-config.yaml \2
  --to=<path_to_directory_for_credentials_requests> 3
```

The --included parameter includes only the manifests that your specific cluster configuration requires.
Specify the location of the install-config.yaml file.
Specify the path to the directory where you want to store the CredentialsRequest objects. If the specified directory does not exist, this command creates it.

[NOTE]
----
This command might take a few moments to run.
----

## Sample customized install-config.yaml file for Alibaba Cloud

You can customize the installation configuration file (install-config.yaml) to specify more details about
your cluster&#8217;s platform or modify the values of the required
parameters.


```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: alicloud-dev.devcluster.openshift.com
credentialsMode: Manual
compute:
- architecture: amd64
  hyperthreading: Enabled
  name: worker
  platform: {}
  replicas: 3
controlPlane:
  architecture: amd64
  hyperthreading: Enabled
  name: master
  platform: {}
  replicas: 3
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: test-cluster 1
 networking:
  clusterNetwork:
  - cidr: 10.128.0.0/14
    hostPrefix: 23
  machineNetwork:
  - cidr: 10.0.0.0/16
  networkType: OVNKubernetes 2
  serviceNetwork:

platform:
  alibabacloud:
    defaultMachinePlatform: 3
      instanceType: ecs.g6.xlarge
      systemDiskCategory: cloud_efficiency
      systemDiskSize: 200
    region: ap-southeast-1 4
    resourceGroupID: rg-acfnw6j3hyai 5
    vpcID: vpc-0xifdjerdibmaqvtjob2b 8
    vswitchIDs: 8
    - vsw-0xi8ycgwc8wv5rhviwdq5
    - vsw-0xiy6v3z2tedv009b4pz2
publish: External
pullSecret: '{"auths": {"cloud.openshift.com": {"auth": ... }' 6
sshKey: |
  ssh-rsa AAAA... 7
```


Required. The installation program prompts you for a cluster name.
The cluster network plugin to install. The default value OVNKubernetes is the only supported value.
Optional. Specify parameters for machine pools that do not define their own platform configuration.
Required. The installation program prompts you for the region to deploy the cluster to.
Optional. Specify an existing resource group where the cluster should be installed.
Required. The installation program prompts you for the pull secret.
Optional. The installation program prompts you for the SSH key value that you use to access the machines in your cluster.
Optional. These are example vswitchID values.

## Configuring the cluster-wide proxy during installation

Production environments can deny direct access to the internet and instead have
an HTTP or HTTPS proxy available. You can configure a new Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
cluster to use a proxy by configuring the proxy settings in the
install-config.yaml file.

* You have an existing install-config.yaml file.
* You reviewed the sites that your cluster requires access to and determined whether any of them need to bypass the proxy. By default, all cluster egress traffic is proxied, including calls to hosting cloud provider APIs. You added sites to the Proxy object's spec.noProxy field to bypass the proxy if necessary.

[NOTE]
----
The Proxy object status.noProxy field is populated with the values of the networking.machineNetwork[].cidr, networking.clusterNetwork[].cidr, and networking.serviceNetwork[] fields from your installation configuration.
For installations on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, and Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP), the Proxy object status.noProxy field is also populated with the instance metadata endpoint (169.254.169.254).
----

1. Edit your install-config.yaml file and add the proxy settings. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: my.domain.com
proxy:
  httpProxy: http://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port> 1
  httpsProxy: https://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port> 2
  noProxy: example.com 3
additionalTrustBundle: | 4
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    <MY_TRUSTED_CA_CERT>
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
additionalTrustBundlePolicy: <policy_to_add_additionalTrustBundle> 5
```

A proxy URL to use for creating HTTP connections outside the cluster. The
URL scheme must be http.
A proxy URL to use for creating HTTPS connections outside the cluster.
A comma-separated list of destination domain names, IP addresses, or other network CIDRs to exclude from proxying. Preface a domain with . to match subdomains only. For example, .y.com matches x.y.com, but not y.com. Use * to bypass the proxy for all destinations.
If provided, the installation program generates a config map that is named user-ca-bundle in
the openshift-config namespace that contains one or more additional CA
certificates that are required for proxying HTTPS connections. The Cluster Network
Operator then creates a trusted-ca-bundle config map that merges these contents
with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) trust bundle, and this config map is referenced in the trustedCA field of the Proxy object. The additionalTrustBundle field is required unless
the proxy's identity certificate is signed by an authority from the RHCOS trust
bundle.
Optional: The policy to determine the configuration of the Proxy object to reference the user-ca-bundle config map in the trustedCA field. The allowed values are Proxyonly and Always. Use Proxyonly to reference the user-ca-bundle config map only when http/https proxy is configured. Use Always to always reference the user-ca-bundle config map. The default value is Proxyonly.

[NOTE]
----
The installation program does not support the proxy readinessEndpoints field.
----

[NOTE]
----
If the installer times out, restart and then complete the deployment by using the wait-for command of the installer. For example:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install wait-for install-complete --log-level debug
```

----
2. Save the file and reference it when installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

The installation program creates a cluster-wide proxy that is named cluster that uses the proxy
settings in the provided install-config.yaml file. If no proxy settings are
provided, a cluster Proxy object is still created, but it will have a nil
spec.


[NOTE]
----
Only the Proxy object named cluster is supported, and no additional
proxies can be created.
----

# Cluster Network Operator configuration

The configuration for the cluster network is specified as part of the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) configuration and stored in a custom resource (CR) object that is named cluster. The CR specifies the fields for the Network API in the operator.openshift.io API group.

The CNO configuration inherits the following fields during cluster installation from the Network API in the Network.config.openshift.io API group:

clusterNetwork:: IP address pools from which pod IP addresses are allocated.
serviceNetwork:: IP address pool for services.
defaultNetwork.type:: Cluster network plugin. OVNKubernetes is the only supported plugin during installation.

You can specify the cluster network plugin configuration for your cluster by setting the fields for the defaultNetwork object in the CNO object named cluster.

## Cluster Network Operator configuration object

The fields for the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) are described in the following table:



## defaultNetwork object configuration

The values for the defaultNetwork object are defined in the following table:



## Configuration for the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin

The following table describes the configuration fields for the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin:










```yaml
defaultNetwork:
  type: OVNKubernetes
  ovnKubernetesConfig:
    mtu: 1400
    genevePort: 6081
      ipsecConfig:
        mode: Full
```



[IMPORTANT]
----
Using OVNKubernetes can lead to a stack exhaustion problem on IBM Power(R).
----

## kubeProxyConfig object configuration (OpenShiftSDN container network interface only)

The values for the kubeProxyConfig object are defined in the following table:



# Specifying advanced network configuration

You can use advanced network configuration for your network plugin to integrate your cluster into your existing network environment.
You can specify advanced network configuration only before you install the cluster.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Customizing your network configuration by modifying the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform manifest files created by the installation program is not supported. Applying a manifest file that you create, as in the following procedure, is supported.
----

* You have created the install-config.yaml file and completed any modifications to it.

1. Change to the directory that contains the installation program and create the manifests:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory> 1
```

<installation_directory> specifies the name of the directory that contains the install-config.yaml file for your cluster.
2. Create a stub manifest file for the advanced network configuration that is named cluster-network-03-config.yml in the <installation_directory>/manifests/ directory:

```terminal
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
```

3. Specify the advanced network configuration for your cluster in the cluster-network-03-config.yml file, such as in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  defaultNetwork:
    ovnKubernetesConfig:
      ipsecConfig:
        mode: Full
```
4. Optional: Back up the manifests/cluster-network-03-config.yml file. The
installation program consumes the manifests/ directory when you create the
Ignition config files.

# Configuring hybrid networking with OVN-Kubernetes

You can configure your cluster to use hybrid networking with the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin. This allows a hybrid cluster that supports different node networking configurations.


[NOTE]
----
This configuration is necessary to run both Linux and Windows nodes in the same cluster.
----

* You defined OVNKubernetes for the networking.networkType parameter in the install-config.yaml file. See the installation documentation for configuring Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform network customizations on your chosen cloud provider for more information.

1. Change to the directory that contains the installation program and create the manifests:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory>
```

where:
<installation_directory>:: Specifies the name of the directory that contains the install-config.yaml file for your cluster.
2. Create a stub manifest file for the advanced network configuration that is named cluster-network-03-config.yml in the <installation_directory>/manifests/ directory:

```terminal
$ cat <<EOF > <installation_directory>/manifests/cluster-network-03-config.yml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
EOF
```

where:
<installation_directory>:: Specifies the directory name that contains the
manifests/ directory for your cluster.
3. Open the cluster-network-03-config.yml file in an editor and configure OVN-Kubernetes with hybrid networking, as in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  defaultNetwork:
    ovnKubernetesConfig:
      hybridOverlayConfig:
        hybridClusterNetwork: 1
        - cidr: 10.132.0.0/14
          hostPrefix: 23
        hybridOverlayVXLANPort: 9898 2
```

Specify the CIDR configuration used for nodes on the additional overlay network. The hybridClusterNetwork CIDR must not overlap with the clusterNetwork CIDR.
Specify a custom VXLAN port for the additional overlay network. This is required for running Windows nodes in a cluster installed on vSphere, and must not be configured for any other cloud provider. The custom port can be any open port excluding the default 4789 port. For more information on this requirement, see the Microsoft documentation on Pod-to-pod connectivity between hosts is broken.

[NOTE]
----
Windows Server Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC): Windows Server 2019 is not supported on clusters with a custom hybridOverlayVXLANPort value because this Windows server version does not support selecting a custom VXLAN port.
----
4. Save the cluster-network-03-config.yml file and quit the text editor.
5. Optional: Back up the manifests/cluster-network-03-config.yml file. The
installation program deletes the manifests/ directory when creating the
cluster.

# Deploying the cluster

You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on a compatible cloud platform.


[IMPORTANT]
----
You can run the create cluster command of the installation program only once, during initial installation.
----

* You have configured an account with the cloud platform that hosts your cluster.
* You have the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.
* You have verified that the cloud provider account on your host has the correct permissions to deploy the cluster. An account with incorrect permissions causes the installation process to fail with an error message that displays the missing permissions.

* Change to the directory that contains the installation program and initialize the cluster deployment:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install create cluster --dir <installation_directory> \ 1
    --log-level=info 2
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the
location of your customized ./install-config.yaml file.
To view different installation details, specify warn, debug, or
error instead of info.

When the cluster deployment completes successfully:

* The terminal displays directions for accessing your cluster, including a link to the web console and credentials for the kubeadmin user.
* Credential information also outputs to <installation_directory>/.openshift_install.log.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not delete the installation program or the files that the installation program creates. Both are required to delete the cluster.
----


```terminal
...
INFO Install complete!
INFO To access the cluster as the system:admin user when using 'oc', run 'export KUBECONFIG=/home/myuser/install_dir/auth/kubeconfig'
INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.mycluster.example.com
INFO Login to the console with user: "kubeadmin", and password: "password"
INFO Time elapsed: 36m22s
```



[IMPORTANT]
----
* The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending node-bootstrapper certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for Recovering from expired control plane certificates for more information.
* It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.
----

# Telemetry access for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15, the Telemetry service, which runs by default to provide metrics about cluster health and the success of updates, requires internet access. If your cluster is connected to the internet, Telemetry runs automatically, and your cluster is registered to https://console.redhat.com/openshift [OpenShift Cluster Manager].

After you confirm that your https://console.redhat.com/openshift [OpenShift Cluster Manager] inventory is correct, either maintained automatically by Telemetry or manually by using OpenShift Cluster Manager, use subscription watch to track your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform subscriptions at the account or multi-cluster level.

* See About remote health monitoring for more information about the Telemetry service.
* See Accessing the web console for more details about accessing and understanding the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console
* See Accessing the web console for more details about accessing and understanding the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

# Next steps

* Validate an installation.
* Customize your cluster.
* If necessary, you can opt out of remote health reporting.
