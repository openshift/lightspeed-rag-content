# Installation configuration parameters for Alibaba Cloud


Before you deploy an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on Alibaba Cloud, you provide parameters to customize your cluster and the platform that hosts it. When you create the install-config.yaml file, you provide values for the required parameters through the command line. You can then modify the install-config.yaml file to customize your cluster further.

# Available installation configuration parameters for Alibaba Cloud

The following tables specify the required, optional, and Alibaba Cloud-specific installation configuration parameters that you can set as part of the installation process.


[NOTE]
----
After installation, you cannot modify these parameters in the install-config.yaml file.

## Required configuration parameters

Required installation configuration parameters are described in the following table:



## Network configuration parameters

You can customize your installation configuration based on the requirements of your existing network infrastructure. For example, you can expand the IP address block for the cluster network or provide different IP address blocks than the defaults.

Only IPv4 addresses are supported.


[NOTE]
----
Globalnet is not supported with Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation disaster recovery solutions. For regional disaster recovery scenarios, ensure that you use a nonoverlapping range of private IP addresses for the cluster and service networks in each cluster.

## Optional configuration parameters

Optional installation configuration parameters are described in the following table:



1. Not all CCO modes are supported for all cloud providers. For more information about CCO modes, see the "Managing cloud provider credentials" entry in the Authentication and authorization content.

## Additional Alibaba Cloud configuration parameters

Additional Alibaba Cloud configuration parameters are described in the following table. The alibabacloud parameters are the configuration used when installing on Alibaba Cloud. The defaultMachinePlatform parameters are the default configuration used when installing on Alibaba Cloud for machine pools that do not define their own platform configuration.

These parameters apply to both compute machines and control plane machines where specified.


[NOTE]
----
If defined, the parameters compute.platform.alibabacloud and controlPlane.platform.alibabacloud will overwrite platform.alibabacloud.defaultMachinePlatform settings for compute machines and control plane machines respectively.
