Creating the required Alibaba Cloud resources

Before you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, you must use the Alibaba Cloud console to create a Resource Access Management (RAM) user that has sufficient permissions to install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform into your Alibaba Cloud. This user must also have permissions to create new RAM users. You can also configure and use the ccoctl tool to create new credentials for the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform components with the permissions that they require.

Alibaba Cloud on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
Creating the required RAM user
You must have a Alibaba Cloud Resource Access Management (RAM) user for the installation that has sufficient privileges. You can use the Alibaba Cloud Resource Access Management console to create a new user or modify an existing user. Later, you create credentials in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform based on this user's permissions.

When you configure the RAM user, be sure to consider the following requirements:

The user must have an Alibaba Cloud AccessKey ID and AccessKey secret pair.

Add the AccessKey ID and secret to the ~/.alibabacloud/credentials file on your local computer. Alibaba Cloud automatically creates this file when you log in to the console. The Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) utility, ccoutil, uses these credentials when processing Credential Request objects.

The RAM user must have the AdministratorAccess policy to ensure that the account has sufficient permission to create the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. This policy grants permissions to manage all Alibaba Cloud resources.


For more information about creating a RAM user and granting permissions, see Create a RAM user and Grant permissions to a RAM user in the Alibaba Cloud documentation.
Configuring the Cloud Credential Operator utility
To assign RAM users and policies that provide long-term RAM AccessKeys (AKs) for each in-cluster component, extract and prepare the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) utility (ccoctl) binary.

The ccoctl utility is a Linux binary that must run in a Linux environment.
You have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform account with cluster administrator access.

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
