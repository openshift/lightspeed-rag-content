Preparing to install on Nutanix

Before you install an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, be sure that your Nutanix environment meets the following requirements.
Nutanix version requirements
You must install the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster to a Nutanix environment that meets the following requirements.
Environment requirements
Before you install an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, review the following Nutanix AOS environment requirements.

Required account privileges
The installation program requires access to a Nutanix account with the necessary permissions to deploy the cluster and to maintain the daily operation of it. The following options are available to you:

You can use a local Prism Central user account with administrative privileges. Using a local account is the quickest way to grant access to an account with the required permissions.

If your organizationâ€™s security policies require that you use a more restrictive set of permissions, use the permissions that are listed in the following table to create a custom Cloud Native role in Prism Central. You can then assign the role to a user account that is a member of a Prism Central authentication directory.


Consider the following when managing this user account:

When assigning entities to the role, ensure that the user can access only the Prism Element and subnet that are required to deploy the virtual machines.

Ensure that the user is a member of the project to which it needs to assign virtual machines.


For more information, see the Nutanix documentation about creating a Custom Cloud Native role, assigning a role, and adding a user to a project.
Cluster limits
Available resources vary between clusters. The number of possible clusters within a Nutanix environment is limited primarily by available storage space and any limitations associated with the resources that the cluster creates, and resources that you require to deploy the cluster, such a IP addresses and networks.
Cluster resources
A minimum of 800 GB of storage is required to use a standard cluster.

When you deploy a Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster that uses installer-provisioned infrastructure, the installation program must be able to create several resources in your Nutanix instance. Although these resources use 856 GB of storage, the bootstrap node is destroyed as part of the installation process.

A standard Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation creates the following resources:

1 label

Virtual machines:
Networking requirements
You must use either AHV IP Address Management (IPAM) or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) for the network and ensure that it is configured to provide persistent IP addresses to the cluster machines. Additionally, create the following networking resources before you install the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster:

IP addresses

DNS records


It is recommended that each Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform node in the cluster have access to a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server that is discoverable via DHCP. Installation is possible without an NTP server. However, an NTP server prevents errors typically associated with asynchronous server clocks.
Required IP Addresses
An installer-provisioned installation requires two static virtual IP (VIP) addresses:

A VIP address for the API is required. This address is used to access the cluster API.

A VIP address for ingress is required. This address is used for cluster ingress traffic.


You specify these IP addresses when you install the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
DNS records
You must create DNS records for two static IP addresses in the appropriate DNS server for the Nutanix instance that hosts your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. In each record, <cluster_name> is the cluster name and <base_domain> is the cluster base domain that you specify when you install the cluster.

A complete DNS record takes the form: <component>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>..
Configuring the Cloud Credential Operator utility
The Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) manages cloud provider credentials as Kubernetes custom resource definitions (CRDs). To install a cluster on Nutanix, you must set the CCO to manual mode as part of the installation process.

To create and manage cloud credentials from outside of the cluster when the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) is operating in manual mode, extract and prepare the CCO utility (ccoctl) binary.

The ccoctl utility is a Linux binary that must run in a Linux environment.
You have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform account with cluster administrator access.

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).


Obtain the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:

Obtain the CCO container image from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:

Extract the ccoctl binary from the CCO container image within the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:

Change the permissions to make ccoctl executable by running the following command:


To verify that ccoctl is ready to use, display the help file by running the following command:
