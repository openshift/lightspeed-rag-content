Installation configuration parameters for Nutanix

Before you deploy an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on Nutanix, you provide parameters to customize your cluster and the platform that hosts it. When you create the install-config.yaml file, you provide values for the required parameters through the command line. You can then modify the install-config.yaml file to customize your cluster further.
