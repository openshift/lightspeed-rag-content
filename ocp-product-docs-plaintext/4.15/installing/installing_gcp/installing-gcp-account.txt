Configuring a GCP project

Before you can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, you must configure a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project to host it.
Creating a GCP project
To install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, you must create a project in your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account to host the cluster.

Create a project to host your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. See
Creating and Managing Projects in the GCP documentation.
Enabling API services in GCP
Your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project requires access to several API services to complete Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation.

You created a project to host your cluster.


Enable the following required API services in the project that hosts your
cluster. You may also enable optional API services which are not required for installation. See
Enabling services
in the GCP documentation.
Configuring DNS for GCP
To install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account you use must have a dedicated public hosted zone in the same project that you host the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. This zone must be authoritative for the domain. The DNS service provides cluster DNS resolution and name lookup for external connections to the cluster.

Identify your domain, or subdomain, and registrar. You can transfer an existing domain and
registrar or obtain a new one through GCP or another source.

Create a public hosted zone for your domain or subdomain in your GCP project. See
Creating public zones
in the GCP documentation.

Extract the new authoritative name servers from the hosted zone records. See
Look up your Cloud DNS name servers
in the GCP documentation.

Update the registrar records for the name servers that your domain
uses. For example, if you registered your domain to Google Domains, see the
following topic in the Google Domains Help:
How to switch to custom name servers.

If you migrated your root domain to Google Cloud DNS, migrate your DNS records. See Migrating to Cloud DNS in the GCP documentation.

If you use a subdomain, follow your company's procedures to add its delegation records to the parent domain. This process might include a request to your company's IT department or the division that controls the root domain and DNS services for your company.
GCP account limits
The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster uses a number of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) components, but the default Quotas do not affect your ability to install a default Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

A default cluster, which contains three compute and three control plane machines, uses the following resources. Note that some resources are required only during the bootstrap process and are removed after the cluster deploys.


If any of the quotas are insufficient during installation, the installation program displays an error that states both which quota was exceeded and the region.
Be sure to consider your actual cluster size, planned cluster growth, and any usage from other clusters that are associated with your account. The CPU, static IP addresses, and persistent disk SSD (storage) quotas are the ones that are most likely to be insufficient.

If you plan to deploy your cluster in one of the following regions, you will exceed the maximum storage quota and are likely to exceed the CPU quota limit:

asia-east2

asia-northeast2

asia-south1

australia-southeast1

europe-north1

europe-west2

europe-west3

europe-west6

northamerica-northeast1

southamerica-east1

us-west2


You can increase resource quotas from the GCP console, but you might need to file a support ticket. Be sure to plan your cluster size early so that you can allow time to resolve the support ticket before you install your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
Creating a service account in GCP
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform requires a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) service account that provides authentication and authorization to access data in the Google APIs. If you do not have an existing IAM service account that contains the required roles in your project, you must create one.

You created a project to host your cluster.


Create a service account in the project that you use to host your
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. See
Creating a service account
in the GCP documentation.

Grant the service account the appropriate permissions. You can either
grant the individual permissions that follow or assign the Owner role to it.
See Granting roles to a service account for specific resources.

You can create the service account key in JSON format, or attach the service account to a GCP virtual machine.
See Creating service account keys and Creating and enabling service accounts for instances in the GCP documentation.


Required GCP roles
When you attach the Owner role to the service account that you create, you grant that service account all permissions, including those that are required to install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. If your organization's security policies require a more restrictive set of permissions, you can create a service account with the following permissions. If you deploy your cluster into an existing virtual private cloud (VPC), the service account does not require certain networking permissions, which are noted in the following lists:

Compute Admin

Role Administrator

Security Admin

Service Account Admin

Service Account Key Admin

Service Account User

Storage Admin


DNS Administrator


Compute Load Balancer Admin


The following roles are applied to the service accounts that the control plane and compute machines use:
Required GCP permissions for installer-provisioned infrastructure
When you attach the Owner role to the service account that you create, you grant that service account all permissions, including those that are required to install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

If your organizationâ€™s security policies require a more restrictive set of permissions, you can create custom roles with the necessary permissions. The following permissions are required for the installer-provisioned infrastructure for creating and deleting the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

Required GCP permissions for shared VPC installations
When you are installing a cluster to a shared VPC, you must configure the service account for both the host project and the service project. If you are not installing to a shared VPC, you can skip this section.

You must apply the minimum roles required for a standard installation as listed above, to the service project. Note that custom roles, and therefore fine-grained permissions, cannot be used in shared VPC installations because GCP does not support adding the required permission compute.organizations.administerXpn to custom roles.

In addition, the host project must apply one of the following configurations to the service account:

projects/<host-project>/roles/dns.networks.bindPrivateDNSZone

roles/compute.networkAdmin

roles/compute.securityAdmin
projects/<host-project>/roles/dns.networks.bindPrivateDNSZone

roles/compute.networkUser
