Installation methods

You can install an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on vSphere using a variety of different installation methods. Each method has qualities that can make them more suitable for different use cases, such as installing a cluster in a disconnected environment or installing a cluster with minimal configuration and provisioning.
Assisted Installer
You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform with the Assisted Installer. This method requires no setup for the installer and is ideal for connected environments like vSphere. Installing with the Assisted Installer also provides integration with vSphere, enabling autoscaling. See Installing an on-premise cluster using the Assisted Installer for additional details.
Agent-based Installer
You can install an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on vSphere using the Agent-based Installer. The Agent-based Installer can be used to boot an on-premises server in a disconnected environment by using a bootable image. With the Agent-based Installer, users also have the flexibility to provision infrastructure, customize network configurations, and customize installations within a disconnected environment. See Preparing to install with the Agent-based Installer for additional details.
Installer-provisioned infrastructure installation
You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on vSphere by using installer-provisioned infrastructure. Installer-provisioned infrastructure allows the installation program to preconfigure and automate the provisioning of resources required by Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. Installer-provisioned infrastructure is useful for installing in environments with disconnected networks, where the installation program provisions the underlying infrastructure for the cluster.

Installing a cluster on vSphere: You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on vSphere by using installer-provisioned infrastructure installation with no customization.

Installing a cluster on vSphere with customizations: You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on vSphere by using installer-provisioned infrastructure installation with the default customization options.

Installing a cluster on vSphere with network customizations: You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on installer-provisioned vSphere infrastructure, with network customizations. You can customize your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform network configuration during installation, so that your cluster can coexist with your existing IP address allocations and adhere to your network requirements.

Installing a cluster on vSphere in a restricted network: You can install a cluster on VMware vSphere infrastructure in a restricted network by creating an internal mirror of the installation release content.
You can use this method to deploy Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on an internal network that is not visible to the internet.
User-provisioned infrastructure installation
You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on vSphere by using user-provisioned infrastructure. User-provisioned infrastructure requires the user to provision all resources required by Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. If you do not use infrastructure that the installation program provisions, you must manage and maintain the cluster resources yourself.

Installing a cluster on vSphere with user-provisioned infrastructure: You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on VMware vSphere infrastructure that you provision.

Installing a cluster on vSphere with network customizations with user-provisioned infrastructure: You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on VMware vSphere infrastructure that you provision with customized network configuration options.

Installing a cluster on vSphere in a restricted network with user-provisioned infrastructure: Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform can be installed on VMware vSphere infrastructure that you provision in a restricted network.


The steps for performing a user-provisioned infrastructure installation are provided as an example only. Installing a cluster with infrastructure you provide requires knowledge of the vSphere platform and the installation process of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. Use the user-provisioned infrastructure installation instructions as a guide; you are free to create the required resources through other methods.
