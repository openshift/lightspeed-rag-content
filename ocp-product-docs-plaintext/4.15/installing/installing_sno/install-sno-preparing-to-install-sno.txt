Preparing to install on a single node

Prerequisites
You reviewed details about the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation and update processes.

You have read the documentation on selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users.
About OpenShift on a single node
You can create a single-node cluster with standard installation methods. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on a single node is a specialized installation that requires the creation of a special Ignition configuration file. The primary use case is for edge computing workloads, including intermittent connectivity, portable clouds, and 5G radio access networks (RAN) close to a base station. The major tradeoff with an installation on a single node is the lack of high availability.

The use of OpenShiftSDN with single-node OpenShift is not supported. OVN-Kubernetes is the default network plugin for single-node OpenShift deployments.
Requirements for installing OpenShift on a single node
Installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on a single node alleviates some of the requirements for high availability and large scale clusters. However, you must address the following requirements:

Administration host: You must have a computer to prepare the ISO, to create the USB boot drive, and to monitor the installation.

CPU Architecture: Installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on a single node supports x86_64, arm64,ppc64le, and s390x CPU architectures.

Supported platforms: Installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on a single node is supported on bare metal, vSphere, AWS cloud, Red Hat OpenStack, OpenShift Virtualization, IBM Power(R), and IBM Z(R) platforms.

Production-grade server: Installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on a single node requires a server with sufficient resources to run Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform services and a production workload.

Networking: The server must have access to the internet or access to a local registry if it is not connected to a routable network. The server must have a DHCP reservation or a static IP address for the Kubernetes API, ingress route, and cluster node domain names. You must configure the DNS to resolve the IP address to each of the following fully qualified domain names (FQDN):
