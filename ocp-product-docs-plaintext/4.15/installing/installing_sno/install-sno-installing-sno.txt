Installing OpenShift on a single node

You can install single-node OpenShift using the web-based Assisted Installer and a discovery ISO that you generate using the Assisted Installer. You can also install single-node OpenShift by using coreos-installer to generate the installation ISO.
Installing single-node OpenShift using the Assisted Installer
To install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on a single node, use the web-based Assisted Installer wizard to guide you through the process and manage the installation.

See the Assisted Installer for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform documentation for details and configuration options.

Generating the discovery ISO with the Assisted Installer
Installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on a single node requires a discovery ISO, which the Assisted Installer can generate.

On the administration host, open a browser and navigate to Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager.

Click Create Cluster to create a new cluster.

In the Cluster name field, enter a name for the cluster.

In the Base domain field, enter a base domain. For example:

Select Install single node OpenShift (SNO) and complete the rest of the wizard steps. Download the discovery ISO.

Make a note of the discovery ISO URL for installing with virtual media.


If you enable OpenShift Virtualization during this process, you must have a second local storage device of at least 50GiB for your virtual machines.

Installing single-node OpenShift with the Assisted Installer
Use the Assisted Installer to install the single-node cluster.

Attach the RHCOS discovery ISO to the target host.

Configure the boot drive order in the server BIOS settings to boot from the attached discovery ISO and then reboot the server.

On the administration host, return to the browser. Wait for the host to appear in the list of discovered hosts. If necessary, reload the Assisted Clusters page and select the cluster name.

Complete the install wizard steps. Add networking details, including a subnet from the available subnets. Add the SSH public key if necessary.

Monitor the installation's progress. Watch the cluster events. After the installation process finishes writing the operating system image to the server's hard disk, the server restarts.

Remove the discovery ISO, and reset the server to boot from the installation drive.

Adding worker nodes to single-node OpenShift clusters
Installing single-node OpenShift on cloud providers
Additional requirements for installing single-node OpenShift on a cloud provider
The documentation for installer-provisioned installation on cloud providers is based on a high availability cluster consisting of three control plane nodes. When referring to the documentation, consider the differences between the requirements for a single-node OpenShift cluster and a high availability cluster.

A high availability cluster requires a temporary bootstrap machine, three control plane machines, and at least two compute machines. For a single-node OpenShift cluster, you need only a temporary bootstrap machine and one cloud instance for the control plane node and no worker nodes.

The minimum resource requirements for high availability cluster installation include a control plane node with 4 vCPUs and 100GB of storage. For a single-node OpenShift cluster, you must have a minimum of 8 vCPU cores and 120GB of storage.

The controlPlane.replicas setting in the install-config.yaml file should be set to 1.

The compute.replicas setting in the install-config.yaml file should be set to 0.
This makes the control plane node schedulable.
Supported cloud providers for single-node OpenShift
The following table contains a list of supported cloud providers and CPU architectures.

Creating a bootable ISO image on a USB drive
You can install software using a bootable USB drive that contains an ISO image. Booting the server with the USB drive prepares the server for the software installation.

On the administration host, insert a USB drive into a USB port.

Create a bootable USB drive, for example:
Booting from an HTTP-hosted ISO image using the Redfish API
You can provision hosts in your network using ISOs that you install using the Redfish Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) API.

This example procedure demonstrates the steps on a Dell server.
Ensure that you have the latest firmware version of iDRAC that is compatible with your hardware. If you have any issues with the hardware or firmware, you must contact the provider.
Download the installation Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) ISO.

Use a Dell PowerEdge server that is compatible with iDRAC9.


Copy the ISO file to an HTTP server accessible in your network.

Boot the host from the hosted ISO file, for example:
Creating a custom live RHCOS ISO for remote server access
In some cases, you cannot attach an external disk drive to a server, however, you need to access the server remotely to provision a node. It is recommended to enable SSH access to the server. You can create a live RHCOS ISO with SSHd enabled and with predefined credentials so that you can access the server after it boots.

You installed the butane utility.


Download the coreos-installer binary from the coreos-installer image mirror page.

Download the latest live RHCOS ISO from mirror.openshift.com.

Create the embedded.yaml file that the butane utility uses to create the Ignition file:

Run the butane utility to create the Ignition file using the following command:

After the Ignition file is created, you can include the configuration in a new live RHCOS ISO, which is named rhcos-sshd-4.15.0-x86_64-live.x86_64.iso, with the coreos-installer utility:


Check that the custom live ISO can be used to boot the server by running the following command:
Installing single-node OpenShift with IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE
Installing a single-node cluster on IBM Z(R) and IBM(R) LinuxONE requires user-provisioned installation using either the "Installing a cluster with RHEL KVM on IBM Z(R) and IBM(R) LinuxONE" or the "Installing a cluster with z/VM on IBM Z(R) and IBM(R) LinuxONE" procedure.

Installing a single-node cluster on IBM Z(R) simplifies installation for development and test environments and requires less resource requirements at entry level.

The equivalent of two Integrated Facilities for Linux (IFL), which are SMT2 enabled, for each cluster.

At least one network connection to both connect to the LoadBalancer service and to serve data for traffic outside the cluster.


You can use dedicated or shared IFLs to assign sufficient compute resources. Resource sharing is one of the key strengths of IBM Z(R). However, you must adjust capacity correctly on each hypervisor layer and ensure sufficient resources for every Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

Setting up basion for single-node OpenShift with IBM Power
Prior to installing single-node OpenShift on IBM Power(R), you must set up bastion. Setting up a bastion server for single-node OpenShift on IBM Power(R) requires the configuration of the following services:

PXE is used for the single-node OpenShift cluster installation. PXE requires the following services to be configured and run:

You must install dnsmasq to support DNS, DHCP and PXE, httpd for HTTP.


Use the following procedure to configure a bastion server that meets these requirements.

Use the following command to install grub2, which is required to enable PXE for PowerVM:

Use the following commands to download RHCOS image files from the mirror repo for PXE.

To create the ignition file for a single-node OpenShift cluster, you must create the install-config.yaml file.

Download the openshift-install image to create the ignition file and copy it to the http directory.
Installing single-node OpenShift with IBM Power
You have set up bastion.


There are two steps for the single-node OpenShift cluster installation. First the single-node OpenShift logical partition (LPAR) needs to boot up with PXE, then you need to monitor the installation progress.

Use the following command to boot powerVM with netboot:

After the single-node OpenShift LPAR boots up with PXE, use the openshift-install command to monitor the progress of installation:
