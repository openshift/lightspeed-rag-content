Configuring an Azure account

Before you can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, you must configure a Microsoft Azure account to meet installation requirements.

All Azure resources that are available through public endpoints are subject to resource name restrictions, and you cannot create resources that use certain terms. For a list of terms that Azure restricts, see Resolve reserved resource name errors in the Azure documentation.
Azure account limits
The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster uses a number of Microsoft Azure components, and the default Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints affect your ability to install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters.

Default limits vary by offer category types, such as Free Trial and Pay-As-You-Go, and by series, such as Dv2, F, and G. For example, the default for Enterprise Agreement subscriptions is 350 cores.

Check the limits for your subscription type and if necessary, increase quota limits for your account before you install a default cluster on Azure.
The following table summarizes the Azure components whose limits can impact your ability to install and run Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters.


Optimizing storage.
Configuring a public DNS zone in Azure
To install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, the Microsoft Azure account you use must have a dedicated public hosted DNS zone in your account. This zone must be authoritative for the domain. This service provides cluster DNS resolution and name lookup for external connections to the cluster.

Identify your domain, or subdomain, and registrar. You can transfer an
existing domain and registrar or obtain a new one through Azure or another source.

If you are using an existing domain and registrar, migrate its DNS to Azure. See
Migrate an active DNS name to Azure App Service
in the Azure documentation.

Configure DNS for your domain. Follow the steps in the
Tutorial: Host your domain in Azure DNS
in the Azure documentation to create a public hosted zone for your domain or
subdomain, extract the new authoritative name servers, and update the registrar
records for the name servers that your domain uses.

If you use a subdomain, follow your company's procedures to add its delegation
records to the parent domain.
Increasing Azure account limits
To increase an account limit, file a support request on the Azure portal.

You can increase only one type of quota per support request.
From the Azure portal, click Help + support in the lower left corner.

Click New support request and then select the required values:

On the Problem Details page, provide the required information for your quota
increase:

Click Next: Review + create and then click Create.
Recording the subscription and tenant IDs
The installation program requires the subscription and tenant IDs that are associated with your Azure account. You can use the Azure CLI to gather this information.

You have installed or updated the Azure CLI.


Log in to the Azure CLI by running the following command:

Ensure that you are using the right subscription:

If you are not using the right subscription:

Record the id and tenantId parameter values from the output. You require these values to install an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
Supported identities to access Azure resources
An Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster requires an Azure identity to create and manage Azure resources. As such, you need one of the following types of identities to complete the installation:

A service principal

A system-assigned managed identity

A user-assigned managed identity


Required Azure roles
An Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster requires an Azure identity to create and manage Azure resources. Before you create the identity, verify that your environment meets the following requirements:

The Azure account that you use to create the identity is assigned the User Access Administrator and Contributor roles. These roles are required when:

If you are going to use a service principal to complete the installation, verify that the Azure account that you use to create the identity is assigned the microsoft.directory/servicePrincipals/createAsOwner permission in Microsoft Entra ID.


To set roles on the Azure portal, see the Manage access to Azure resources using RBAC and the Azure portal in the Azure documentation.
Required Azure permissions for installer-provisioned infrastructure
The installation program requires access to an Azure service principal or managed identity with the necessary permissions to deploy the cluster and to maintain its daily operation. These permissions must be granted to the Azure subscription that is associated with the identity.

The following options are available to you:

You can assign the identity the Contributor and User Access Administrator roles. Assigning these roles is the quickest way to grant all of the required permissions.

If your organization's security policies require a more restrictive set of permissions, you can create a custom role with the necessary permissions.

To install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on Azure, you must scope the permissions to your subscription. Later, you can re-scope these permissions to the installer created resource group. If the public DNS zone is present in a different resource group, then the network DNS zone related permissions must always be applied to your subscription. By default, the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program assigns the Azure identity the Contributor role.

You can scope all the permissions to your subscription when deleting an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
Using Azure managed identities
The installation program requires an Azure identity to complete the installation. You can use either a system-assigned or user-assigned managed identity.

If you are unable to use a managed identity, you can use a service principal.

If you are using a system-assigned managed identity, enable it on the virtual machine that you will run the installation program from.

If you are using a user-assigned managed identity:

Verify that the required permissions are assigned to the managed identity.
Creating a service principal
The installation program requires an Azure identity to complete the installation. You can use a service principal.

If you are unable to use a service principal, you can use a managed identity.

You have installed or updated the Azure CLI.

You have an Azure subscription ID.

If you are not going to assign the Contributor and User Administrator Access roles to the service principal, you have created a custom role with the required Azure permissions.


Create the service principal for your account by running the following command:

Record the values of the appId and password parameters from the output. You require these values when installing the cluster.

If you applied the Contributor role to your service principal, assign the User Administrator Access role by running the following command:

Supported Azure Marketplace regions
Installing a cluster using the Azure Marketplace image is available to customers who purchase the offer in North America and EMEA.

While the offer must be purchased in North America or EMEA, you can deploy the cluster to any of the Azure public partitions that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform supports.

Deploying a cluster using the Azure Marketplace image is not supported for the Azure Government regions.
Supported Azure regions
The installation program dynamically generates the list of available Microsoft Azure regions based on your subscription.
