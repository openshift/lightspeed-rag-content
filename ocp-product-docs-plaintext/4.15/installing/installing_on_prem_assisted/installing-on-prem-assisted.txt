Installing an on-premise cluster using the Assisted Installer

You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on on-premise hardware or on-premise VMs by using the Assisted Installer. Installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform by using the Assisted Installer supports x86_64, AArch64, ppc64le, and s390x CPU architectures.
Using the Assisted Installer
The Assisted Installer is a user-friendly installation solution offered on the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console. The Assisted Installer supports the various deployment platforms with a focus on bare metal, Nutanix, and vSphere infrastructures.

The Assisted Installer provides installation functionality as a service. This software-as-a-service (SaaS) approach has the following advantages:

Web user interface: The web user interface performs cluster installation without the user having to create the installation configuration files manually.

No bootstrap node: A bootstrap node is not required when installing with the Assisted Installer. The bootstrapping process executes on a node within the cluster.

Hosting: The Assisted Installer hosts:

Streamlined installation workflow: Deployment does not require in-depth knowledge of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. The Assisted Installer provides reasonable defaults and provides the installer as a service, which:

Advanced networking: The Assisted Installer supports IPv4 networking with SDN and OVN, IPv6 and dual stack networking with OVN only, NMState-based static IP addressing, and an HTTP/S proxy. OVN is the default Container Network Interface (CNI) for OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 and later releases. SDN is supported up to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14, but is not supported for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15 and later releases.

Preinstallation validation: The Assisted Installer validates the configuration before installation to ensure a high probability of success. The validation process includes the following checks:

REST API: The Assisted Installer has a REST API, enabling automation.


The Assisted Installer supports installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on premises in a connected environment, including with an optional HTTP/S proxy. It can install the following:

Highly available Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform or single-node OpenShift (SNO)

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on bare metal, Nutanix, or vSphere with full platform integration, or other virtualization platforms without integration

Optional: OpenShift Virtualization, multicluster engine, Logical volume manager storage (LVM Storage), and OpenShift Data Foundation


The user interface provides an intuitive interactive workflow where automation does not exist or is not required. Users may also automate installations using the REST API.

See the Assisted Installer for OpenShift Container Platform documentation for details.
