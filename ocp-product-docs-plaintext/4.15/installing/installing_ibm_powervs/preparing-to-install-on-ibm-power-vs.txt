Preparing to install on IBM Power Virtual Server

The installation workflows documented in this section are for IBM Power(R) Virtual Server infrastructure environments.
Prerequisites
You reviewed details about the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation and update processes.

You read the documentation on selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users.
Requirements for installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on IBM Power Virtual Server
Before installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on IBM Power(R) Virtual Server you must create a service account and configure an IBM Cloud(R) account. See Configuring an IBM Cloud(R) account for details about creating an account, configuring DNS and supported IBM Power(R) Virtual Server regions.

You must manually manage your cloud credentials when installing a cluster to IBM Power(R) Virtual Server. Do this by configuring the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) for manual mode before you install the cluster.
Choosing a method to install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on IBM Power Virtual Server
You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on IBM Power(R) Virtual Server using installer-provisioned infrastructure. This process involves using an installation program to provision the underlying infrastructure for your cluster. Installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on IBM Power(R) Virtual Server using user-provisioned infrastructure is not supported at this time.

See Installation process for more information about installer-provisioned installation processes.

Installing a cluster on installer-provisioned infrastructure
You can install a cluster on IBM Power(R) Virtual Server infrastructure that is provisioned by the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program by using one of the following methods:

Installing a customized cluster on IBM Power(R) Virtual Server: You can install a customized cluster on IBM Power(R) Virtual Server infrastructure that the installation program provisions. The installation program allows for some customization to be applied at the installation stage. Many other customization options are available post-installation.

Installing a cluster on IBM Power(R) Virtual Server into an existing VPC: You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on IBM Power(R) Virtual Server into an existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). You can use this installation method if you have constraints set by the guidelines of your company, such as limits when creating new accounts or infrastructure.

Installing a private cluster on IBM Power(R) Virtual Server: You can install a private cluster on IBM Power(R) Virtual Server. You can use this method to deploy Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on an internal network that is not visible to the internet.

Installing a cluster on IBM Power(R) Virtual Server in a restricted network: You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on IBM Power(R) Virtual Server on installer-provisioned infrastructure by using an internal mirror of the installation release content. You can use this method to install a cluster that does not require an active internet connection to obtain the software components.
Configuring the Cloud Credential Operator utility
The Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) manages cloud provider credentials as Kubernetes custom resource definitions (CRDs). To install a cluster on IBM Power(R) Virtual Server, you must set the CCO to manual mode as part of the installation process.

To create and manage cloud credentials from outside of the cluster when the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) is operating in manual mode, extract and prepare the CCO utility (ccoctl) binary.

The ccoctl utility is a Linux binary that must run in a Linux environment.
You have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform account with cluster administrator access.

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).


Obtain the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:

Obtain the CCO container image from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:

Extract the ccoctl binary from the CCO container image within the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:

Change the permissions to make ccoctl executable by running the following command:


To verify that ccoctl is ready to use, display the help file by running the following command:
