Installing a cluster on user-provisioned infrastructure in AWS by using CloudFormation templates

In "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" version "4.15", you can install a cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS) that uses infrastructure that you provide.

One way to create this infrastructure is to use the provided CloudFormation templates. You can modify the templates to customize your infrastructure or use the information that they contain to create AWS objects according to your company's policies.

The steps for performing a user-provisioned infrastructure installation are provided as an example only. Installing a cluster with infrastructure you provide requires knowledge of the cloud provider and the installation process of "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform". Several CloudFormation templates are provided to assist in completing these steps or to help model your own. You are also free to create the required resources through other methods; the templates are just an example.
Prerequisites
You reviewed details about the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation and update processes.

You read the documentation on selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users.

You configured an AWS account to host the cluster.

You downloaded the AWS CLI and installed it on your computer. See Install the AWS CLI Using the Bundled Installer (Linux, macOS, or UNIX) in the AWS documentation.

If you use a firewall, you configured it to allow the sites that your cluster requires access to.

If the cloud identity and access management (IAM) APIs are not accessible in your environment, or if you do not want to store an administrator-level credential secret in the kube-system namespace, you can manually create and maintain long-term credentials.
Internet access for "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform"
In "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" "4.15", you require access to the internet to install your cluster.

You must have internet access to:

Access OpenShift Cluster Manager to download the installation program and perform subscription management. If the cluster has internet access and you do not disable Telemetry, that service automatically entitles your cluster.

Access Quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install your cluster.

Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.
Requirements for a cluster with user-provisioned infrastructure
For a cluster that contains user-provisioned infrastructure, you must deploy all of the required machines.

This section describes the requirements for deploying "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" on user-provisioned infrastructure.

Required machines for cluster installation
The smallest "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" clusters require the following hosts:


To maintain high availability of your cluster, use separate physical hosts for these cluster machines.
The bootstrap and control plane machines must use Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) as the operating system. However, the compute machines can choose between Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS), Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.6 and later.

Note that RHCOS is based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9.2 and inherits all of its hardware certifications and requirements. See Red Hat Enterprise Linux technology capabilities and limits.
Minimum resource requirements for cluster installation
Each cluster machine must meet the following minimum requirements:


One vCPU is equivalent to one physical core when simultaneous multithreading (SMT), or hyperthreading, is not enabled. When enabled, use the following formula to calculate the corresponding ratio: (threads per core × cores) × sockets = vCPUs.

"Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" and Kubernetes are sensitive to disk performance, and faster storage is recommended, particularly for etcd on the control plane nodes which require a 10 ms p99 fsync duration. Note that on many cloud platforms, storage size and IOPS scale together, so you might need to over-allocate storage volume to obtain sufficient performance.

As with all user-provisioned installations, if you choose to use RHEL compute machines in your cluster, you take responsibility for all operating system life cycle management and maintenance, including performing system updates, applying patches, and completing all other required tasks. Use of RHEL 7 compute machines is deprecated and has been removed in "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" 4.10 and later.
If an instance type for your platform meets the minimum requirements for cluster machines, it is supported to use in "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform".

Optimizing storage
Tested instance types for AWS
The following Amazon Web Services (AWS) instance types have been tested with "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform".

Use the machine types included in the following charts for your AWS instances. If you use an instance type that is not listed in the chart, ensure that the instance size you use matches the minimum resource requirements that are listed in the section named "Minimum resource requirements for cluster installation".
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/installer/master/docs/user/aws/tested_instance_types_x86_64.md
Tested instance types for AWS on 64-bit ARM infrastructures
The following Amazon Web Services (AWS) 64-bit ARM instance types have been tested with "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform".

Use the machine types included in the following charts for your AWS ARM instances. If you use an instance type that is not listed in the chart, ensure that the instance size you use matches the minimum resource requirements that are listed in "Minimum resource requirements for cluster installation".
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/installer/master/docs/user/aws/tested_instance_types_aarch64.md
Certificate signing requests management
Because your cluster has limited access to automatic machine management when you use infrastructure that you provision, you must provide a mechanism for approving cluster certificate signing requests (CSRs) after installation. The kube-controller-manager only approves the kubelet client CSRs. The machine-approver cannot guarantee the validity of a serving certificate that is requested by using kubelet credentials because it cannot confirm that the correct machine issued the request. You must determine and implement a method of verifying the validity of the kubelet serving certificate requests and approving them.
Required AWS infrastructure components
To install "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" on user-provisioned infrastructure in Amazon Web Services (AWS), you must manually create both the machines and their supporting infrastructure.

For more information about the integration testing for different platforms, see the OpenShift Container Platform 4.x Tested Integrations page.

By using the provided CloudFormation templates, you can create stacks of AWS resources that represent the following components:

An AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

Networking and load balancing components

Security groups and roles

An "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" bootstrap node

"Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" control plane nodes

An "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" compute node


Alternatively, you can manually create the components or you can reuse existing infrastructure that meets the cluster requirements. Review the CloudFormation templates for more details about how the components interrelate.

Other infrastructure components
A VPC

DNS entries

Load balancers (classic or network) and listeners

A public and a private Route 53 zone

Security groups

IAM roles

S3 buckets


If you are working in a disconnected environment, you are unable to reach the public IP addresses for EC2, ELB, and S3 endpoints. Depending on the level to which you want to restrict internet traffic during the installation, the following configuration options are available:


Create a VPC endpoint and attach it to the subnets that the clusters are using. Name the endpoints as follows:

ec2.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com

elasticloadbalancing.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com

s3.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com


With this option, network traffic remains private between your VPC and the required AWS services.


As part of the installation process, you can configure an HTTP or HTTPS proxy. With this option, internet traffic goes through the proxy to reach the required AWS services.


As part of the installation process, you can configure an HTTP or HTTPS proxy with VPC endpoints. Create a VPC endpoint and attach it to the subnets that the clusters are using. Name the endpoints as follows:

ec2.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com

elasticloadbalancing.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com

s3.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com


When configuring the proxy in the install-config.yaml file, add these endpoints to the noProxy field. With this option, the proxy prevents the cluster from accessing the internet directly. However, network traffic remains private between your VPC and the required AWS services.

You must provide a suitable VPC and subnets that allow communication to your machines.


Your DNS and load balancer configuration needs to use a public hosted zone and can use a private hosted zone similar to the one that the installation program uses if it provisions the cluster's infrastructure. You must create a DNS entry that resolves to your load balancer. An entry for api.<cluster_name>.<domain> must point to the external load balancer, and an entry for api-int.<cluster_name>.<domain> must point to the internal load balancer.

The cluster also requires load balancers and listeners for port 6443, which are required for the Kubernetes API and its extensions, and port 22623, which are required for the Ignition config files for new machines. The targets will be the control plane nodes. Port 6443 must be accessible to both clients external to the cluster and nodes within the cluster. Port 22623 must be accessible to nodes within the cluster.


The control plane and worker machines require access to the following ports:


The control plane machines require the following Ingress groups. Each Ingress group is a AWS::EC2::SecurityGroupIngress resource.


The worker machines require the following Ingress groups. Each Ingress group is a AWS::EC2::SecurityGroupIngress resource.


You must grant the machines permissions in AWS. The provided CloudFormation templates grant the machines Allow permissions for the following AWS::IAM::Role objects and provide a AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile for each set of roles. If you do not use the templates, you can grant the machines the following broad permissions or the following individual permissions.
Cluster machines
You need AWS::EC2::Instance objects for the following machines:

A bootstrap machine. This machine is required during installation, but you can remove it after your cluster deploys.

Three control plane machines. The control plane machines are not governed by a control plane machine set.

Compute machines. You must create at least two compute machines, which are also known as worker machines, during installation. These machines are not governed by a compute machine set.
Required AWS permissions for the IAM user
Your IAM user must have the permission tag:GetResources in the region us-east-1 to delete the base cluster resources. As part of the AWS API requirement, the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation program performs various actions in this region.
When you attach the AdministratorAccess policy to the IAM user that you create in Amazon Web Services (AWS), you grant that user all of the required permissions. To deploy all components of an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster, the IAM user requires the following permissions:

ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress

ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress

ec2:DescribeInstanceTypeOfferings

servicequotas:ListAWSDefaultServiceQuotas
sts:AssumeRole
Obtaining an AWS Marketplace image
If you are deploying an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster using an AWS Marketplace image, you must first subscribe through AWS. Subscribing to the offer provides you with the AMI ID that the installation program uses to deploy compute nodes.

You have an AWS account to purchase the offer. This account does not have to be the same account that is used to install the cluster.


Complete the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" subscription from the AWS Marketplace.

Record the AMI ID for your specific AWS Region. If you use the CloudFormation template to deploy your compute nodes, you must update the worker0.type.properties.ImageID parameter with the AMI ID value.
Obtaining the installation program
Before you install "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform", download the installation file on  the host you are using for installation.

You have a computer that runs Linux or macOS, with 500 MB of local disk space.


Access the Infrastructure Provider page on the OpenShift Cluster Manager site. If you have a Red Hat account, log in with your credentials. If you do not, create an account.

Select your infrastructure provider.

Navigate to the page for your installation type, download the installation program that corresponds with your host operating system and architecture, and place the file in the directory where you will store the installation configuration files.

Extract the installation program. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux
operating system, run the following command:

Download your installation pull secret from Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager. This pull secret allows you to authenticate with the services that are provided by the included authorities, including Quay.io, which serves the container images for "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" components.
Generating a key pair for cluster node SSH access
During an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation, you can provide an SSH public key to the installation program. The key is passed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) nodes through their Ignition config files and is used to authenticate SSH access to the nodes. The key is added to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys list for the core user on each node, which enables password-less authentication.

After the key is passed to the nodes, you can use the key pair to SSH in to the RHCOS nodes as the user core. To access the nodes through SSH, the private key identity must be managed by SSH for your local user.

If you want to SSH in to your cluster nodes to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, you must provide the SSH public key during the installation process. The ./openshift-install gather command also requires the SSH public key to be in place on the cluster nodes.

Do not skip this procedure in production environments, where disaster recovery and debugging is required.
You must use a local key, not one that you configured with platform-specific approaches such as AWS key pairs.
If you do not have an existing SSH key pair on your local machine to use for authentication onto your cluster nodes, create one. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

View the public SSH key:

Add the SSH private key identity to the SSH agent for your local user, if it has not already been added. SSH agent management of the key is required for password-less SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes, or if you want to use the ./openshift-install gather command.

Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent:


When you install "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform", provide the SSH public key to the installation program.
If you install a cluster on infrastructure that you provision, you must provide the key to the installation program.
Creating the installation files for AWS
To install "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using user-provisioned infrastructure, you must generate the files that the installation program needs to deploy your cluster and modify them so that the cluster creates only the machines that it will use. You generate and customize the install-config.yaml file, Kubernetes manifests, and Ignition config files. You also have the option to first set up a separate var partition during the preparation phases of installation.

Optional: Creating a separate /var partition
It is recommended that disk partitioning for "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" be left to the installer. However, there are cases where you might want to create separate partitions in a part of the filesystem that you expect to grow.

"Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" supports the addition of a single partition to attach storage to either the /var partition or a subdirectory of /var. For example:

/var/lib/containers: Holds container-related content that can grow as more images and containers are added to a system.

/var/lib/etcd: Holds data that you might want to keep separate for purposes such as performance optimization of etcd storage.

/var: Holds data that you might want to keep separate for purposes such as auditing.


Storing the contents of a /var directory separately makes it easier to grow storage for those areas as needed and reinstall "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" at a later date and keep that data intact. With this method, you will not have to pull all your containers again, nor will you have to copy massive log files when you update systems.

Because /var must be in place before a fresh installation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS), the following procedure sets up the separate /var partition by creating a machine config manifest that is inserted during the openshift-install preparation phases of an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation.

If you follow the steps to create a separate /var partition in this procedure, it is not necessary to create the Kubernetes manifest and Ignition config files again as described later in this section.
Create a directory to hold the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation files:

Run openshift-install to create a set of files in the manifest and openshift subdirectories. Answer the system questions as you are prompted:

Optional: Confirm that the installation program created manifests in the clusterconfig/openshift directory:

Create a Butane config that configures the additional partition. For example, name the file $HOME/clusterconfig/98-var-partition.bu, change the disk device name to the name of the storage device on the worker systems, and set the storage size as appropriate. This example places the /var directory on a separate partition:

Create a manifest from the Butane config and save it to the clusterconfig/openshift directory. For example, run the following command:

Run openshift-install again to create Ignition configs from a set of files in the manifest and openshift subdirectories:


Now you can use the Ignition config files as input to the installation procedures to install Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) systems.
Creating the installation configuration file
Generate and customize the installation configuration file that the installation program needs to deploy your cluster.

You obtained the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation program
for user-provisioned infrastructure
and the pull secret for your cluster.

You checked that you are deploying your cluster to an AWS Region with an accompanying Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) AMI published by Red Hat. If you are deploying to an AWS Region that requires a custom AMI, such as an AWS GovCloud Region, you must create the install-config.yaml file manually.


Create the install-config.yaml file.

If you are installing a three-node cluster, modify the install-config.yaml file by setting the compute.replicas parameter to 0. This ensures that the cluster's control planes are schedulable. For more information, see "Installing a three-node cluster on AWS".

Optional: Back up the install-config.yaml file.


See Configuration and credential file settings in the AWS documentation for more information about AWS profile and credential configuration.
Configuring the cluster-wide proxy during installation
Production environments can deny direct access to the internet and instead have an HTTP or HTTPS proxy available. You can configure a new "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster to use a proxy by configuring the proxy settings in the install-config.yaml file.

You have an existing install-config.yaml file.

You reviewed the sites that your cluster requires access to and determined whether any of them need to bypass the proxy. By default, all cluster egress traffic is proxied, including calls to hosting cloud provider APIs. You added sites to the Proxy object's spec.noProxy field to bypass the proxy if necessary.


Edit your install-config.yaml file and add the proxy settings. For example:

Save the file and reference it when installing "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform".


The installation program creates a cluster-wide proxy that is named cluster that uses the proxy settings in the provided install-config.yaml file. If no proxy settings are provided, a cluster Proxy object is still created, but it will have a nil spec.

Only the Proxy object named cluster is supported, and no additional proxies can be created.
Creating the Kubernetes manifest and Ignition config files
Because you must modify some cluster definition files and manually start the cluster machines, you must generate the Kubernetes manifest and Ignition config files that the cluster needs to configure the machines.

The installation configuration file transforms into the Kubernetes manifests. The manifests wrap into the Ignition configuration files, which are later used to configure the cluster machines.

The Ignition config files that the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending node-bootstrapper certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for Recovering from expired control plane certificates for more information.

It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.
You obtained the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation program.

You created the install-config.yaml installation configuration file.


Change to the directory that contains the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation program and generate the Kubernetes manifests for the cluster:

Remove the Kubernetes manifest files that define the control plane machines:

Remove the Kubernetes manifest files that define the control plane machine set:

Check that the mastersSchedulable parameter in the <installation_directory>/manifests/cluster-scheduler-02-config.yml Kubernetes manifest file is set to false. This setting prevents pods from being scheduled on the control plane machines:

Optional: If you do not want
the Ingress Operator
to create DNS records on your behalf, remove the privateZone and publicZone
sections from the <installation_directory>/manifests/cluster-dns-02-config.yml DNS configuration file:

To create the Ignition configuration files, run the following command from the directory that contains the installation program:
Extracting the infrastructure name
The Ignition config files contain a unique cluster identifier that you can use to uniquely identify your cluster in Amazon Web Services (AWS). The infrastructure name is also used to locate the appropriate AWS resources during an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation. The provided CloudFormation templates contain references to this infrastructure name, so you must extract it.

You obtained the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.

You can view details about the CloudFormation stacks that you create by navigating to the AWS CloudFormation console.
Accessing RHCOS AMIs with stream metadata
In "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform", stream metadata provides standardized metadata about RHCOS in the JSON format and injects the metadata into the cluster. Stream metadata is a stable format that supports multiple architectures and is intended to be self-documenting for maintaining automation.

You can use the coreos print-stream-json sub-command of openshift-install to access information about the boot images in the stream metadata format. This command provides a method for printing stream metadata in a scriptable, machine-readable format.

For user-provisioned installations, the openshift-install binary contains references to the version of RHCOS boot images that are tested for use with "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform", such as the AWS AMI.

To parse the stream metadata, use one of the following methods:

From a Go program, use the official stream-metadata-go library at https://github.com/coreos/stream-metadata-go. You can also view example code in the library.

From another programming language, such as Python or Ruby, use the JSON library of your preferred programming language.

From a command-line utility that handles JSON data, such as jq:
RHCOS AMIs for the AWS infrastructure
Red Hat provides Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) AMIs that are valid for the various AWS regions and instance architectures that you can manually specify for your "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" nodes.

By importing your own AMI, you can also install to regions that do not have a published RHCOS AMI.


AWS regions without a published RHCOS AMI
You can deploy an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster to Amazon Web Services (AWS) regions without native support for a Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) Amazon Machine Image (AMI) or the AWS software development kit (SDK). If a published AMI is not available for an AWS region, you can upload a custom AMI prior to installing the cluster.

If you are deploying to a region not supported by the AWS SDK and you do not specify a custom AMI, the installation program copies the us-east-1 AMI to the user account automatically. Then the installation program creates the control plane machines with encrypted EBS volumes using the default or user-specified Key Management Service (KMS) key. This allows the AMI to follow the same process workflow as published RHCOS AMIs.

A region without native support for an RHCOS AMI is not available to select from the terminal during cluster creation because it is not published. However, you can install to this region by configuring the custom AMI in the install-config.yaml file.
Uploading a custom RHCOS AMI in AWS
If you are deploying to a custom Amazon Web Services (AWS) region, you must upload a custom Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that belongs to that region.

You configured an AWS account.

You created an Amazon S3 bucket with the required IAM
service role.

You uploaded your RHCOS VMDK file to Amazon S3.

You downloaded the AWS CLI and installed it on your computer. See

The file is specific to a cluster and is created during "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" installation.

You deployed an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster.

You installed the oc CLI.


Export the kubeadmin credentials:

Verify you can run oc commands successfully using the exported configuration:
Approving the certificate signing requests for your machines
When you add machines to a cluster, two pending certificate signing requests (CSRs) are generated for each machine that you added. You must confirm that these CSRs are approved or, if necessary, approve them yourself. The client requests must be approved first, followed by the server requests.

You added machines to your cluster.


Confirm that the cluster recognizes the machines:

Review the pending CSRs and ensure that you see the client requests with the Pending or Approved status for each machine that you added to the cluster:

If the CSRs were not approved, after all of the pending CSRs for the machines you added are in Pending status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines:

Now that your client requests are approved, you must review the server requests for each machine that you added to the cluster:

If the remaining CSRs are not approved, and are in the Pending status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines:

After all client and server CSRs have been approved, the machines have the Ready status. Verify this by running the following command:


For more information on CSRs, see Certificate Signing Requests.
Initial Operator configuration
After the control plane initializes, you must immediately configure some Operators so that they all become available.

Your control plane has initialized.


Watch the cluster components come online:

Configure the Operators that are not available.


Image registry storage configuration
Amazon Web Services provides default storage, which means the Image Registry Operator is available after installation. However, if the Registry Operator cannot create an S3 bucket and automatically configure storage, you must manually configure registry storage.

Instructions are shown for configuring a persistent volume, which is required for production clusters. Where applicable, instructions are shown for configuring an empty directory as the storage location, which is available for only non-production clusters.

Additional instructions are provided for allowing the image registry to use block storage types by using the Recreate rollout strategy during upgrades.

You can configure registry storage for user-provisioned infrastructure in AWS to deploy "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" to hidden regions. See Configuring the registry for AWS user-provisioned infrastructure for more information.

Configuring registry storage for AWS with user-provisioned infrastructure
During installation, your cloud credentials are sufficient to create an Amazon S3 bucket and the Registry Operator will automatically configure storage.

If the Registry Operator cannot create an S3 bucket and automatically configure storage, you can create an S3 bucket and configure storage with the following procedure.

You have a cluster on AWS with user-provisioned infrastructure.

For Amazon S3 storage, the secret is expected to contain two keys:


Use the following procedure if the Registry Operator cannot create an S3 bucket and automatically configure storage.

Set up a Bucket Lifecycle Policy
to abort incomplete multipart uploads that are one day old.

Fill in the storage configuration in
configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster:


To secure your registry images in AWS, block public access to the S3 bucket.
Configuring storage for the image registry in non-production clusters
You must configure storage for the Image Registry Operator. For non-production clusters, you can set the image registry to an empty directory. If you do so, all images are lost if you restart the registry.

To set the image registry storage to an empty directory:
Deleting the bootstrap resources
