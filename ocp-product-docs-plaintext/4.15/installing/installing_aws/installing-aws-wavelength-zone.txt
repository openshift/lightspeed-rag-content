Installing a cluster on AWS with compute nodes on AWS Wavelength Zones

You can quickly install an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Wavelength Zones by setting the zone names in the edge compute pool of the install-config.yaml file, or install a cluster in an existing Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with Wavelength Zone subnets.

AWS Wavelength Zones is an infrastructure that AWS configured for mobile edge computing (MEC) applications.

A Wavelength Zone embeds AWS compute and storage services within the 5G network of a communication service provider (CSP). By placing application servers in a Wavelength Zone, the application traffic from your 5G devices can stay in the 5G network. The application traffic of the device reaches the target server directly, making latency a non-issue.

See Wavelength Zones in the AWS documentation.

About AWS Wavelength Zones and edge compute pool
Read the following sections to understand infrastructure behaviors and cluster limitations in an AWS Wavelength Zones environment.

Cluster limitations in AWS Wavelength Zones
Some limitations exist when you try to deploy a cluster with a default installation configuration in an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Wavelength Zone.

The following list details limitations when deploying a cluster in a pre-configured AWS zone:

The maximum transmission unit (MTU) between an Amazon EC2 instance in a zone and an Amazon EC2 instance in the Region is 1300. This causes the cluster-wide network MTU to change according to the network plugin that is used with the deployment.

Network resources such as Network Load Balancer (NLB), Classic Load Balancer, and Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateways are not globally supported.

For an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on AWS, the AWS Elastic Block Storage (EBS) gp3 type volume is the default for node volumes and the default for the storage class. This volume type is not globally available on zone locations. By default, the nodes running in zones are deployed with the gp2 EBS volume. The gp2-csi StorageClass parameter must be set when creating workloads on zone nodes.
If you want the installation program to automatically create Wavelength Zone subnets for your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, specific configuration limitations apply with this method. The following note details some of these limitations. For other limitations, ensure that you read the "Quotas and considerations for Wavelength Zones" document that Red Hat provides in the "Infrastructure prerequisites" section.

The following configuration limitation applies when you set the installation program to automatically create subnets for your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster:

When the installation program creates private subnets in AWS Wavelength Zones, the program associates each subnet with the route table of its parent zone. This operation ensures that each private subnet can route egress traffic to the internet by way of NAT Gateways in an AWS Region.

If the parent-zone route table does not exist during cluster installation, the installation program associates any private subnet with the first available private route table in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). This approach is valid only for AWS Wavelength Zones subnets in an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
About edge compute pools
Edge compute nodes are tainted compute nodes that run in AWS Wavelength Zones locations.

When deploying a cluster that uses Wavelength Zones, consider the following points:

Amazon EC2 instances in the Wavelength Zones are more expensive than Amazon EC2 instances in the Availability Zones.

The latency is lower between the applications running in AWS Wavelength Zones and the end user. A latency impact exists for some workloads if, for example, ingress traffic is mixed between Wavelength Zones and Availability Zones.


Generally, the maximum transmission unit (MTU) between an Amazon EC2 instance in a Wavelength Zones and an Amazon EC2 instance in the Region is 1300. The cluster network MTU must be always less than the EC2 MTU to account for the overhead. The specific overhead is determined by the network plugin. For example: OVN-Kubernetes has an overhead of 100 bytes.

The network plugin can provide additional features, such as IPsec, that also affect the MTU sizing.

For more information, see How AWS Wavelength work in the AWS documentation.
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 introduced a new compute pool, edge, that is designed for use in remote zones. The edge compute pool configuration is common between AWS Wavelength Zones locations. Because of the type and size limitations of resources like EC2 and EBS on Wavelength Zones resources, the default instance type can vary from the traditional compute pool.

The default Elastic Block Store (EBS) for Wavelength Zones locations is gp2, which differs from the non-edge compute pool. The instance type used for each Wavelength Zones on an edge compute pool also might differ from other compute pools, depending on the instance offerings on the zone.

The edge compute pool creates new labels that developers can use to deploy applications onto AWS Wavelength Zones nodes. The new labels are:

node-role.kubernetes.io/edge=''

machine.openshift.io/zone-type=wavelength-zone

machine.openshift.io/zone-group=$ZONE_GROUP_NAME


By default, the machine sets for the edge compute pool define the taint of NoSchedule to prevent other workloads from spreading on Wavelength Zones instances. Users can only run user workloads if they define tolerations in the pod specification.

Installation prerequisites
Before you install a cluster in an AWS Wavelength Zones environment, you must configure your infrastructure so that it can adopt Wavelength Zone capabilities.

Opting in to an AWS Wavelength Zones
If you plan to create subnets in AWS Wavelength Zones, you must opt in to each zone group separately.

You have installed the AWS CLI.

You have determined an AWS Region for where you want to deploy your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

You have attached a permissive IAM policy to a user or role account that opts in to the zone group.


List the zones that are available in your AWS Region by running the following command:

Opt in to the zone group on your AWS account by running the following command:
Internet access for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15, you require access to the internet to install your cluster.

You must have internet access to:

Access https://console.redhat.com/openshift [OpenShift Cluster Manager] to download the installation program and perform subscription management. If the cluster has internet access and you do not disable Telemetry, that service automatically entitles your cluster.

Access Quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install your cluster.

Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.
Obtaining an AWS Marketplace image
If you are deploying an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster using an AWS Marketplace image, you must first subscribe through AWS. Subscribing to the offer provides you with the AMI ID that the installation program uses to deploy compute nodes.

You have an AWS account to purchase the offer. This account does not have to be the same account that is used to install the cluster.


Complete the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform subscription from the AWS Marketplace.

Record the AMI ID for your specific AWS Region. As part of the installation process, you must update the install-config.yaml file with this value before deploying the cluster.
Installing the OpenShift CLI by downloading the binary
You can install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) to interact with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform from a command-line interface. You can install oc on Linux, Windows, or macOS.

If you installed an earlier version of oc, you cannot use it to complete all of the commands in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15. Download and install the new version of oc.

You can install the OpenShift CLI (oc) binary on Linux by using the following procedure.

Navigate to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform downloads page on the Red Hat Customer Portal.

Select the architecture from the Product Variant drop-down list.

Select the appropriate version from the Version drop-down list.

Click Download Now next to the OpenShift v4.15 Linux Client entry and save the file.

Unpack the archive:

Place the oc binary in a directory that is on your PATH.


After you install the OpenShift CLI, it is available using the oc command:



You can install the OpenShift CLI (oc) binary on Windows by using the following procedure.

Navigate to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform downloads page on the Red Hat Customer Portal.

Select the appropriate version from the Version drop-down list.

Click Download Now next to the OpenShift v4.15 Windows Client entry and save the file.

Unzip the archive with a ZIP program.

Move the oc binary to a directory that is on your PATH.


After you install the OpenShift CLI, it is available using the oc command:



You can install the OpenShift CLI (oc) binary on macOS by using the following procedure.

Navigate to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform downloads page on the Red Hat Customer Portal.

Select the appropriate version from the Version drop-down list.

Click Download Now next to the OpenShift v4.15 macOS Client entry and save the file.

Unpack and unzip the archive.

Move the oc binary to a directory on your PATH.


After you install the OpenShift CLI, it is available using the oc command:
Obtaining the installation program
Before you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, download the installation file on  the host you are using for installation.

You have a computer that runs Linux or macOS, with 500 MB of local disk space.


Access the Infrastructure Provider page on the OpenShift Cluster Manager site. If you have a Red Hat account, log in with your credentials. If you do not, create an account.

Select your infrastructure provider.

Navigate to the page for your installation type, download the installation program that corresponds with your host operating system and architecture, and place the file in the directory where you will store the installation configuration files.

Extract the installation program. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux
operating system, run the following command:

Download your installation https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret [pull secret from Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager]. This pull secret allows you to authenticate with the services that are provided by the included authorities, including Quay.io, which serves the container images for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform components.
Generating a key pair for cluster node SSH access
During an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation, you can provide an SSH public key to the installation program. The key is passed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) nodes through their Ignition config files and is used to authenticate SSH access to the nodes. The key is added to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys list for the core user on each node, which enables password-less authentication.

After the key is passed to the nodes, you can use the key pair to SSH in to the RHCOS nodes as the user core. To access the nodes through SSH, the private key identity must be managed by SSH for your local user.

If you want to SSH in to your cluster nodes to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, you must provide the SSH public key during the installation process. The ./openshift-install gather command also requires the SSH public key to be in place on the cluster nodes.

Do not skip this procedure in production environments, where disaster recovery and debugging is required.
You must use a local key, not one that you configured with platform-specific approaches such as AWS key pairs.
If you do not have an existing SSH key pair on your local machine to use for authentication onto your cluster nodes, create one. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

View the public SSH key:

Add the SSH private key identity to the SSH agent for your local user, if it has not already been added. SSH agent management of the key is required for password-less SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes, or if you want to use the ./openshift-install gather command.

Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent:


When you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, provide the SSH public key to the installation program.
Preparing for the installation
Before you extend nodes to Wavelength Zones, you must prepare certain resources for the cluster installation environment.

Minimum resource requirements for cluster installation
Each cluster machine must meet the following minimum requirements:


One vCPU is equivalent to one physical core when simultaneous multithreading (SMT), or hyperthreading, is not enabled. When enabled, use the following formula to calculate the corresponding ratio: (threads per core × cores) × sockets = vCPUs.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and Kubernetes are sensitive to disk performance, and faster storage is recommended, particularly for etcd on the control plane nodes which require a 10 ms p99 fsync duration. Note that on many cloud platforms, storage size and IOPS scale together, so you might need to over-allocate storage volume to obtain sufficient performance.

As with all user-provisioned installations, if you choose to use RHEL compute machines in your cluster, you take responsibility for all operating system life cycle management and maintenance, including performing system updates, applying patches, and completing all other required tasks. Use of RHEL 7 compute machines is deprecated and has been removed in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 and later.
As of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.13, RHCOS is based on RHEL version 9.2, which updates the micro-architecture requirements. The following list contains the minimum instruction set architectures (ISA) that each architecture requires:

x86-64 architecture requires x86-64-v2 ISA

ARM64 architecture requires ARMv8.0-A ISA

IBM Power architecture requires Power 9 ISA

s390x architecture requires z14 ISA


For more information, see RHEL Architectures.
If an instance type for your platform meets the minimum requirements for cluster machines, it is supported to use in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
Tested instance types for AWS
The following Amazon Web Services (AWS) instance types have been tested with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform for use with AWS Wavelength Zones.

Use the machine types included in the following charts for your AWS instances. If you use an instance type that is not listed in the chart, ensure that the instance size you use matches the minimum resource requirements that are listed in the section named "Minimum resource requirements for cluster installation".

Deploying the cluster
Installing a cluster in an existing VPC that has Wavelength Zone subnets
You can install a cluster into an existing Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The installation program provisions the rest of the required infrastructure, which you can further customize. To customize the installation, modify parameters in the install-config.yaml file before you install the cluster.

Installing a cluster on AWS into an existing VPC requires extending compute nodes to the edge of the Cloud Infrastructure by using AWS Wavelength Zones.

You can use a provided CloudFormation template to create network resources. Additionally, you can modify a template to customize your infrastructure or use the information that they contain to create AWS resources according to your company's policies.

The steps for performing an installer-provisioned infrastructure installation are provided for example purposes only. Installing a cluster in an existing VPC requires that you have knowledge of the cloud provider and the installation process of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. You can use a CloudFormation template to assist you with completing these steps or to help model your own cluster installation. Instead of using the CloudFormation template to create resources, you can decide to use other methods for generating these resources.
Creating a VPC in AWS
You can create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), and subnets for all Wavelength Zones locations, in Amazon Web Services (AWS) for your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster to extend compute nodes to edge locations. You can further customize your VPC to meet your requirements, including a VPN and route tables. You can also add new Wavelength Zones subnets not included at initial deployment.

You can use the provided CloudFormation template and a custom parameter file to create a stack of AWS resources that represent the VPC.

If you do not use the provided CloudFormation template to create your AWS infrastructure, you must review the provided information and manually create the infrastructure. If your cluster does not initialize correctly, you might have to contact Red Hat support with your installation logs.
You configured an AWS account.

You added your AWS keys and AWS Region to your local AWS profile by running aws configure.

You opted in to the AWS Wavelength Zones on your AWS account.


Create a JSON file that contains the parameter values that the CloudFormation template requires:

Go to the section of the documentation named "CloudFormation template for the VPC", and then copy the syntax from the provided template. Save the copied template syntax as a YAML file on your local system. This template describes the VPC that your cluster requires.

Launch the CloudFormation template to create a stack of AWS resources that represent the VPC by running the following command:

Confirm that the template components exist by running the following command:
CloudFormation template for the VPC

Creating a VPC carrier gateway
To use public subnets in your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster that runs on Wavelength Zones, you must create the carrier gateway and associate the carrier gateway to the VPC. Subnets are useful for deploying load balancers or edge compute nodes.

To create edge nodes or internet-facing load balancers in Wavelength Zones locations for your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, you must create the following required network components:

A carrier gateway that associates to the existing VPC.

A carrier route table that lists route entries.

A subnet that associates to the carrier route table.


Carrier gateways exist for VPCs that only contain subnets in a Wavelength Zone.

The following list explains the functions of a carrier gateway in the context of an AWS Wavelength Zones location:

Provides connectivity between your Wavelength Zone and the carrier network, which includes any available devices from the carrier network.

Performs Network Address Translation (NAT) functions, such as translating IP addresses that are public IP addresses stored in a network border group, from Wavelength Zones to carrier IP addresses. These translation functions apply to inbound and outbound traffic.

Authorizes inbound traffic from a carrier network that is located in a specific location.

Authorizes outbound traffic to a carrier network and the internet.


No inbound connection configuration exists from the internet to a Wavelength Zone through the carrier gateway.
You can use the provided CloudFormation template to create a stack of the following AWS resources:

One carrier gateway that associates to the VPC ID in the template.

One public route table for the Wavelength Zone named as <ClusterName>-public-carrier.

Default IPv4 route entry in the new route table that targets the carrier gateway.

VPC gateway endpoint for an AWS Simple Storage Service (S3).


If you do not use the provided CloudFormation template to create your AWS infrastructure, you must review the provided information and manually create the infrastructure. If your cluster does not initialize correctly, you might have to contact Red Hat support with your installation logs.
You configured an AWS account.

You added your AWS keys and region to your local AWS profile by running aws configure.


Go to the next section of the documentation named "CloudFormation template for the VPC Carrier Gateway", and then copy the syntax from the CloudFormation template for VPC Carrier Gateway template. Save the copied template syntax as a YAML file on your local system. This template describes the VPC that your cluster requires.

Run the following command to deploy the CloudFormation template, which creates a stack of AWS resources that represent the VPC:


Confirm that the CloudFormation template components exist by running the following command:

Modifying an installation configuration file to use AWS Wavelength Zones subnets
Modify your install-config.yaml file to include Wavelength Zones subnets.

You created subnets by using the procedure "Creating subnets in Wavelength Zones".

You created an install-config.yaml file by using the procedure "Creating the installation configuration file".


Modify the install-config.yaml configuration file by specifying Wavelength Zones subnets in the platform.aws.subnets parameter.


For more information about viewing the CloudFormation stacks that you created, see AWS CloudFormation console.

For more information about AWS profile and credential configuration, see Configuration and credential file settings in the AWS documentation.


Deploying the cluster
Optional: Assign public IP addresses to edge compute nodes
If your workload requires deploying the edge compute nodes in public subnets on Wavelength Zones infrastructure, you can configure the machine set manifests when installing a cluster.

AWS Wavelength Zones infrastructure accesses the network traffic in a specified zone, so applications can take advantage of lower latency when serving end users that are closer to that zone.

The default setting that deploys compute nodes in private subnets might not meet your needs, so consider creating edge compute nodes in public subnets when you want to apply more customization to your infrastructure.

By default, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform deploy the compute nodes in private subnets. For best performance, consider placing compute nodes in subnets that have their Public IP addresses attached to the subnets.

You must create additional security groups, but ensure that you only open the groups' rules over the internet when you really need to.
Change to the directory that contains the installation program and generate the manifest files. Ensure that the installation manifests get created at the openshift and manifests directory level.

Edit the machine set manifest that the installation program generates for the Wavelength Zones, so that the manifest gets deployed in public subnets. Specify true for the spec.template.spec.providerSpec.value.publicIP parameter.
Deploying the cluster
You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on a compatible cloud platform.

You can run the create cluster command of the installation program only once, during initial installation.
You have configured an account with the cloud platform that hosts your cluster.

You have the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.

You have verified that the cloud provider account on your host has the correct permissions to deploy the cluster. An account with incorrect permissions causes the installation process to fail with an error message that displays the missing permissions.


Change to the directory that contains the installation program and initialize the cluster deployment:

Optional: Remove or disable the AdministratorAccess policy from the IAM
account that you used to install the cluster.


When the cluster deployment completes successfully:

The terminal displays directions for accessing your cluster, including a link to the web console and credentials for the kubeadmin user.

Credential information also outputs to <installation_directory>/.openshift_install.log.


Do not delete the installation program or the files that the installation program creates. Both are required to delete the cluster.
...
INFO Install complete!
INFO To access the cluster as the system:admin user when using 'oc', run 'export KUBECONFIG=/home/myuser/install_dir/auth/kubeconfig'
INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.mycluster.example.com
INFO Login to the console with user: "kubeadmin", and password: "password"
INFO Time elapsed: 36m22s
The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending node-bootstrapper certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for Recovering from expired control plane certificates for more information.

It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.
Verifying the status of the deployed cluster
Verify that your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform successfully deployed on AWS Wavelength Zones.

Logging in to the cluster by using the CLI
You can log in to your cluster as a default system user by exporting the cluster kubeconfig file. The kubeconfig file contains information about the cluster that is used by the CLI to connect a client to the correct cluster and API server. The file is specific to a cluster and is created during Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation.

You deployed an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

You installed the oc CLI.


Export the kubeadmin credentials:

Verify you can run oc commands successfully using the exported configuration:
Logging in to the cluster by using the web console
The kubeadmin user exists by default after an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation. You can log in to your cluster as the kubeadmin user by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

You have access to the installation host.

You completed a cluster installation and all cluster Operators are available.


Obtain the password for the kubeadmin user from the kubeadmin-password file on the installation host:

List the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console route:

Navigate to the route detailed in the output of the preceding command in a web browser and log in as the kubeadmin user.


For more information about accessing and understanding the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, see Accessing the web console for more details about accessing and understanding the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.
Verifying nodes that were created with edge compute pool
After you install a cluster that uses AWS Wavelength Zones infrastructure, check the status of the machine that was created by the machine set manifests created during installation.

To check the machine sets created from the subnet you added to the install-config.yaml file, run the following command:

To check the machines that were created from the machine sets, run the following command:

To check nodes with edge roles, run the following command:
Telemetry access for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15, the Telemetry service, which runs by default to provide metrics about cluster health and the success of updates, requires internet access. If your cluster is connected to the internet, Telemetry runs automatically, and your cluster is registered to https://console.redhat.com/openshift [OpenShift Cluster Manager].

After you confirm that your https://console.redhat.com/openshift [OpenShift Cluster Manager] inventory is correct, either maintained automatically by Telemetry or manually by using OpenShift Cluster Manager, use subscription watch to track your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform subscriptions at the account or multi-cluster level.

For more information about the Telemetry service, see About remote health monitoring.
