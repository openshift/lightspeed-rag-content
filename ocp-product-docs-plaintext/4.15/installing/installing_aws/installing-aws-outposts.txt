Installing a cluster on AWS with compute nodes on AWS Outposts

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.14, you could install a cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS) with compute nodes running in AWS Outposts as a Technology Preview. As of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.15, this installation method is no longer supported.

Instead, you can install a cluster on AWS into an existing VPC and provision compute nodes on AWS Outposts as a postinstallation configuration task.
