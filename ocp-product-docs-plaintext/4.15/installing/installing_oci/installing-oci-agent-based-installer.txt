Installing a cluster on {oci-first-no-rt} by using the Agent-based Installer

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15, you can use the Agent-based Installer to install a cluster on Oracle(R) Cloud Infrastructure, so that you can run cluster workloads on infrastructure that supports dedicated, hybrid, public, and multiple cloud environments.
The Agent-based Installer and OCI overview
You can install an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on Oracle(R) Cloud Infrastructure by using the Agent-based Installer. Both Red Hat and Oracle test, validate, and support running OCI and Oracle(R) Cloud VMware Solution (OCVS) workloads in an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on OCI.

Using the Agent-based Installer to install an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on OCI that is configured with a virtual machine (VM) compute instance is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
The Agent-based installer provides the ease of use of the Assisted Installation service, but with the capability to install a cluster in either a connected or disconnected environment.

OCI provides services that can meet your regulatory compliance, performance, and cost-effectiveness needs. OCI supports 64-bit x86 instances and 64-bit ARM instances. Additionally, OCI provides an OCVS service where you can move VMware workloads to OCI with minimal application re-architecture.

Consider selecting a nonvolatile memory express (NVMe) drive or a solid-state drive (SSD) for your boot disk, because these drives offer low latency and high throughput capabilities for your boot disk.
By running your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on OCI, you can access the following capabilities:

Compute flexible shapes, where you can customize the number of Oracle(R) CPUs (OCPUs) and memory resources for your VM. With access to this capability, a cluster’s workload can perform operations in a resource-balanced environment. You can find all RHEL-certified OCI shapes by going to the Oracle page on the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog portal.

Block Volume storage, where you can configure scaling and auto-tuning settings for your storage volume, so that the Block Volume service automatically adjusts the performance level to optimize performance.

OCVS, where you can deploy a cluster in a public-cloud environment that operates on a VMware® vSphere software-defined data center (SDDC). You continue to retain full-administrative control over your VMware vSphere environment, but you can use OCI services to improve your applications on flexible, scalable, and secure infrastructure.


To ensure the best performance conditions for your cluster workloads that operate on OCI and on the OCVS service, ensure volume performance units (VPUs) for your block volume is sized for your workloads. The following list provides some guidance in selecting the VPUs needed for specific performance needs:

Test or proof of concept environment: 100 GB, and 20 to 30 VPUs.

Basic environment: 500 GB, and 60 VPUs.

Heavy production environment: More than 500 GB, and 100 or more VPUs.


Consider reserving additional VPUs to provide sufficient capacity for updates and scaling activities. For more information about VPUs, see Volume Performance Units (Oracle documentation).

Creating OCI infrastructure resources and services
You must create an OCI environment on your virtual machine (VM) shape. By creating this environment, you can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and deploy a cluster on an infrastructure that supports a wide range of cloud options and strong security policies. Having prior knowledge of OCI components can help you with understanding the concept of OCI resources and how you can configure them to meet your organizational needs.

The Agent-based installer method for installing an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on OCI requires that you manually create OCI resources and services.

To ensure compatibility with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, you must set A as the record type for each DNS record and name records as follows:

api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>, which targets the apiVIP parameter of the API load balancer.

api-int.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>, which targets the apiVIP parameter of the API load balancer.

*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>, which targets the ingressVIP parameter of the Ingress load balancer.


The api.* and api-int.* DNS records relate to control plane machines, so you must ensure that all nodes in your installed Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster can access these DNS records.
You configured an OCI account to host the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. See Prerequisites (Oracle documentation).


Create the required OCI resources and services. See OCI Resources Needed for Using the Agent-based Installer (Oracle documentation).

Creating configuration files for installing a cluster on OCI
You need to create the install-config.yaml and the agent-config.yaml configuration files so that you can use the Agent-based Installer to generate a bootable ISO image. The Agent-based installation comprises a bootable ISO that has the Assisted discovery agent and the Assisted Service. Both of these components are required to perform the cluster installation, but the latter component runs on only one of the hosts.

At a later stage, you must follow the steps in the Oracle documentation for uploading your generated agent ISO image to Oracle’s default Object Storage bucket, which is the initial step for integrating your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on Oracle(R) Cloud Infrastructure.

You can also use the Agent-based Installer to generate or accept Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) custom resources.
You reviewed details about the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation and update processes.

You read the documentation on selecting a cluster installation method and preparing the method for users.

You have read the "Preparing to install with the Agent-based Installer" documentation.

You downloaded the Agent-Based Installer and the command-line interface (CLI) from the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console.

You have logged in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform with administrator privileges.


For a disconnected environment, mirror the Mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift to your local container image registry.

Configure the install-config.yaml configuration file to meet the needs of your organization.

Create a directory on your local system named openshift.

Complete the steps in the "Configuration Files" section of the Oracle documentation to download Oracle Cloud Controller Manager (CCM) and Oracle Container Storage Interface (CSI) manifests as an archive file and save the archive file in your openshift directory. You need the Oracle CCM manifests for deploying the Oracle CCM during cluster installation so that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform can connect to the external OCI platform. You need the Oracle CSI custom manifests for deploying the Oracle CSI driver during cluster installation so that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform can claim required objects from OCI.

Access the custom manifest files that are provided in the "Configuration Files" section of the Oracle documentation.

Use the Agent-based Installer to generate a minimal ISO image, which excludes the rootfs image, by entering the following command in your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI. You can use this image later in the process to boot all your cluster’s nodes.

Configure the agent-config.yaml configuration file to meet your organization’s requirements.

Apply one of the following two updates to your agent-config.yaml configuration file:

Configuring your firewall for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
Before you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, you must configure your firewall to grant access to the sites that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform requires. When using a firewall, make additional configurations to the firewall so that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform can access the sites that it requires to function.

For a disconnected environment, you must mirror content from both Red Hat and Oracle. This environment requires that you create firewall rules to expose your firewall to specific ports and registries.

If your environment has a dedicated load balancer in front of your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, review the allowlists between your firewall and load balancer to prevent unwanted network restrictions to your cluster.
Set the following registry URLs for your firewall's allowlist:

Set your firewall's allowlist to include any site that provides resources for a language or framework that your builds require.

If you do not disable Telemetry, you must grant access to the following URLs to access Red Hat Insights:

Set your firewall's allowlist to include the following registry URLs:

Set your firewall's allowlist to include the following external URLs. Each repository URL hosts OCI containers. Consider mirroring images to as few repositories as possible to reduce any performance issues.
Running a cluster on OCI
To run a cluster on Oracle(R) Cloud Infrastructure, you must upload the generated agent ISO image to the default Object Storage bucket on OCI. Additionally, you must create a compute instance from the supplied base image, so that your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and OCI can communicate with each other for the purposes of running the cluster on OCI.

OCI supports the following Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster topologies:

Installing an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on a single node.

A highly-availabile cluster that has a minimum of three control plane instances and two compute instances.

A compact three-node cluster that has a minimum of three control plane instances.
You generated an agent ISO image. See the "Creating configuration files for installing a cluster on OCI" section.


Upload the agent ISO image to Oracle’s default Object Storage bucket and import the agent ISO image as a custom image to this bucket. Ensure you that you configure the custom image to boot in Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) mode. For more information, see Creating the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform ISO Image (Oracle documentation).

Create a compute instance from the supplied base image for your cluster topology. See Creating the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on OCI (Oracle documentation).
