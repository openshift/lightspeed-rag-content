Introduction to OpenShift API for Data Protection

The OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) product safeguards customer applications on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. It offers comprehensive disaster recovery protection, covering Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform applications, application-related cluster resources, persistent volumes, and internal images. OADP is also capable of backing up both containerized applications and virtual machines (VMs).
