# Pods crash or restart due to lack of memory or CPU


If a Velero or Restic pod crashes due to a lack of memory or CPU, you can set specific resource requests for either of those resources.
The values for the resource request fields must follow the same format as Kubernetes resource requirements.
If you do not specify configuration.velero.podConfig.resourceAllocations or configuration.restic.podConfig.resourceAllocations, see the following default resources specification configuration for a Velero or Restic pod:

```yaml
requests:
  cpu: 500m
  memory: 128Mi
```

* Velero CPU and memory requirements based on collected data

# Setting resource requests for a Velero pod

You can use the configuration.velero.podConfig.resourceAllocations specification field in the oadp_v1alpha1_dpa.yaml file to set specific resource requests for a Velero pod.

* Set the cpu and memory resource requests in the YAML file:
Example Velero file

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
...
configuration:
  velero:
    podConfig:
      resourceAllocations: 1
        requests:
          cpu: 200m
          memory: 256Mi
```

The resourceAllocations listed are for average usage.

# Setting resource requests for a Restic pod

You can use the configuration.restic.podConfig.resourceAllocations specification field to set specific resource requests for a Restic pod.

* Set the cpu and memory resource requests in the YAML file:
Example Restic file

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
...
configuration:
  restic:
    podConfig:
      resourceAllocations: 1
        requests:
          cpu: 1000m
          memory: 16Gi
```

The resourceAllocations listed are for average usage.
