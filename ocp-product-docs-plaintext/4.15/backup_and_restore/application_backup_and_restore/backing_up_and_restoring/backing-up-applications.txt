Backing up applications

You back up applications by creating a Backup custom resource (CR). See Creating a Backup CR.

The Backup CR creates backup files for Kubernetes resources and internal images on S3 object storage.

If your cloud provider has a native snapshot API or supports CSI snapshots, the Backup CR backs up persistent volumes (PVs) by creating snapshots. For more information about working with CSI snapshots, see Backing up persistent volumes with CSI snapshots.


For more information about CSI volume snapshots, see CSI volume snapshots.

The CloudStorage API, which automates the creation of a bucket for object storage, is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
The CloudStorage API is a Technology Preview feature when you use a CloudStorage object and want OADP to use the CloudStorage API to automatically create an S3 bucket for use as a BackupStorageLocation.

The CloudStorage API supports manually creating a BackupStorageLocation object by specifying an existing S3 bucket. The CloudStorage API that creates an S3 bucket automatically is currently only enabled for AWS S3 storage.
If your cloud provider does not support snapshots or if your applications are on NFS data volumes, you can create backups by using Kopia or Restic. See Backing up applications with File System Backup: Kopia or Restic.


The OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) does not support backing up volume snapshots that were created by other software.
You can create backup hooks to run commands before or after the backup operation. See Creating backup hooks.

You can schedule backups by creating a Schedule CR instead of a Backup CR. See Scheduling backups using Schedule CR].
Known issues
OpenShift Container Platform "4.15" enforces a pod security admission (PSA) policy that can hinder the readiness of pods during a Restic restore process. 

This issue has been resolved in the OADP 1.1.6 and OADP 1.2.2 releases, therefore it is recommended that users upgrade to these releases.

For more information, see Restic restore partially failing on OCP 4.15 due to changed PSA policy.
