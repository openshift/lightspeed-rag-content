Configuring the OpenShift API for Data Protection with Multicloud Object Gateway

You install the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) with Multicloud Object Gateway (MCG) by installing the OADP Operator. The Operator installs Velero 1.11.

Starting from OADP 1.0.4, all OADP 1.0.z versions can only be used as a dependency of the MTC Operator and are not available as a standalone Operator.
You configure Multicloud Object Gateway as a backup location. MCG is a component of OpenShift Data Foundation. You configure MCG as a backup location in the DataProtectionApplication custom resource (CR).

The CloudStorage API, which automates the creation of a bucket for object storage, is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
You create a Secret for the backup location and then you install the Data Protection Application. For more details, see Installing the OADP Operator.

To install the OADP Operator in a restricted network environment, you must first disable the default OperatorHub sources and mirror the Operator catalog. For details, see Using Operator Lifecycle Manager on restricted networks.
Retrieving Multicloud Object Gateway credentials
You must retrieve the Multicloud Object Gateway (MCG) credentials in order to create a Secret custom resource (CR) for the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP).

MCG is a component of OpenShift Data Foundation.

You must deploy OpenShift Data Foundation by using the appropriate OpenShift Data Foundation deployment guide.


Obtain the S3 endpoint, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY by running the describe command on the NooBaa custom resource.

Create a credentials-velero file:
About backup and snapshot locations and their secrets
You specify backup and snapshot locations and their secrets in the DataProtectionApplication custom resource (CR).


You specify AWS S3-compatible object storage, such as Multicloud Object Gateway or MinIO, as a backup location.

Velero backs up Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform resources, Kubernetes objects, and internal images as an archive file on object storage.


If you use your cloud provider's native snapshot API to back up persistent volumes, you must specify the cloud provider as the snapshot location.

If you use Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots, you do not need to specify a snapshot location because you will create a VolumeSnapshotClass CR to register the CSI driver.

If you use File System Backup (FSB), you do not need to specify a snapshot location because FSB backs up the file system on object storage.


If the backup and snapshot locations use the same credentials or if you do not require a snapshot location, you create a default Secret.

If the backup and snapshot locations use different credentials, you create two secret objects:

Custom Secret for the backup location, which you specify in the DataProtectionApplication CR.

Default Secret for the snapshot location, which is not referenced in the DataProtectionApplication CR.


The Data Protection Application requires a default Secret. Otherwise, the installation will fail.

If you do not want to specify backup or snapshot locations during the installation, you can create a default Secret with an empty credentials-velero file.
Creating a default Secret
You create a default Secret if your backup and snapshot locations use the same credentials or if you do not require a snapshot location.

The default name of the Secret is cloud-credentials.

The DataProtectionApplication custom resource (CR) requires a default Secret.  Otherwise, the installation will fail. If the name of the backup location Secret is not specified, the default name is used.

If you do not want to use the backup location credentials during the installation, you can create a Secret with the default name by using an empty credentials-velero file.
Your object storage and cloud storage, if any, must use the same credentials.

You must configure object storage for Velero.

You must create a credentials-velero file for the object storage in the appropriate format.


Create a Secret with the default name:


The Secret is referenced in the spec.backupLocations.credential block of the DataProtectionApplication CR when you install the Data Protection Application.
Creating secrets for different credentials
If your backup and snapshot locations use different credentials, you must create two Secret objects:

Backup location Secret with a custom name. The custom name is specified in the spec.backupLocations block of the DataProtectionApplication custom resource (CR).

Snapshot location Secret with the default name, cloud-credentials. This Secret is not specified in the DataProtectionApplication CR.


Create a credentials-velero file for the snapshot location in the appropriate format for your cloud provider.

Create a Secret for the snapshot location with the default name:

Create a credentials-velero file for the backup location in the appropriate format for your object storage.

Create a Secret for the backup location with a custom name:

Add the Secret with the custom name to the DataProtectionApplication CR, as in the following example:
Configuring the Data Protection Application
You can configure the Data Protection Application by setting Velero resource allocations or enabling self-signed CA certificates.

Setting Velero CPU and memory resource allocations
You set the CPU and memory resource allocations for the Velero pod by editing the  DataProtectionApplication custom resource (CR) manifest.

You must have the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Operator installed.


Edit the values in the spec.configuration.velero.podConfig.ResourceAllocations block of the DataProtectionApplication CR manifest, as in the following example:


Kopia is an option in OADP 1.3 and later releases. You can use Kopia for file system backups, and Kopia is your only option for Data Mover cases with the built-in Data Mover.

Kopia is more resource intensive than Restic, and you might need to adjust the CPU and memory requirements accordingly.
Enabling self-signed CA certificates
You must enable a self-signed CA certificate for object storage by editing the DataProtectionApplication custom resource (CR) manifest to prevent a certificate signed by unknown authority error.

You must have the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Operator installed.


Edit the spec.backupLocations.velero.objectStorage.caCert parameter and spec.backupLocations.velero.config parameters of the DataProtectionApplication CR manifest:


Using CA certificates with the velero command aliased for Velero deployment
You might want to use the Velero CLI without installing it locally on your system by creating an alias for it.

You must be logged in to the OpenShift Container Platform cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

You must have the OpenShift CLI (oc) installed.


In a future release of OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP), we plan to mount the certificate to the Velero pod so that this step is not required.
Installing the Data Protection Application 1.2 and earlier
You install the Data Protection Application (DPA) by creating an instance of the DataProtectionApplication API.

You must install the OADP Operator.

You must configure object storage as a backup location.

If you use snapshots to back up PVs, your cloud provider must support either a native snapshot API or Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots.

If the backup and snapshot locations use the same credentials, you must create a Secret with the default name, cloud-credentials.

If the backup and snapshot locations use different credentials, you must create two Secrets:


Click Operators -> Installed Operators and select the OADP Operator.

Under Provided APIs, click Create instance in the DataProtectionApplication box.

Click YAML View and update the parameters of the DataProtectionApplication manifest:

Click Create.


Verify the installation by viewing the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) resources by running the following command:

Verify that the DataProtectionApplication (DPA) is reconciled by running the following command:

Verify the type is set to Reconciled.

Verify the backup storage location and confirm that the PHASE is Available by running the following command:
