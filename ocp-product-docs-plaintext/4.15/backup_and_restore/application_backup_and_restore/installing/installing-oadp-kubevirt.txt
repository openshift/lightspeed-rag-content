Installing the Data Protection Application 1.3
You install the Data Protection Application (DPA) by creating an instance of the DataProtectionApplication API.

You must install the OADP Operator.

You must configure object storage as a backup location.

If you use snapshots to back up PVs, your cloud provider must support either a native snapshot API or Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots.

If the backup and snapshot locations use the same credentials, you must create a Secret with the default name, cloud-credentials.


Click Operators -> Installed Operators and select the OADP Operator.

Under Provided APIs, click Create instance in the DataProtectionApplication box.

Click YAML View and update the parameters of the DataProtectionApplication manifest:

Click Create.
