Using Data Mover for CSI snapshots

The OADP Data Mover enables customers to back up Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume snapshots to a remote object store. When Data Mover is enabled, you can restore stateful applications, using CSI volume snapshots pulled from the object store if a failure, accidental deletion, or corruption of the cluster occurs.

The Data Mover solution uses the Restic option of VolSync.

Data Mover supports backup and restore of CSI volume snapshots only.

In OADP 1.2 Data Mover VolumeSnapshotBackups (VSBs) and VolumeSnapshotRestores (VSRs) are queued using the VolumeSnapshotMover (VSM). The VSM's performance is improved by specifying a concurrent number of VSBs and VSRs simultaneously InProgress. After all async plugin operations are complete, the backup is marked as complete.

The OADP 1.2 Data Mover is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
Red Hat recommends that customers who use OADP 1.2 Data Mover in order to back up and restore ODF CephFS volumes, upgrade or install "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" version 4.12 or later for improved performance. OADP Data Mover can leverage CephFS shallow volumes in "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" version 4.12 or later, which based on our testing, can improve the performance of backup times.
