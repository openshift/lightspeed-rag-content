Using OADP 1.2 Data Mover with Ceph storage

You can use OADP 1.2 Data Mover to back up and restore application data for clusters that use CephFS, CephRBD, or both.

OADP 1.2 Data Mover leverages Ceph features that support large-scale environments. One of these is the shallow copy method, which is available for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 and later. This feature supports backing up and restoring StorageClass and AccessMode resources other than what is found on the source persistent volume claim (PVC).

The CephFS shallow copy feature is a backup feature. It is not part of restore operations.
Prerequisites for using OADP 1.2 Data Mover with Ceph storage
The following prerequisites apply to all back up and restore operations of data using OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.2 Data Mover in a cluster that uses Ceph storage:

You have installed Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 or later.

You have installed the OADP Operator.

You have created a secret cloud-credentials in the namespace openshift-adp.

You have installed Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation.

You have installed the latest VolSync Operator by using Operator Lifecycle Manager.
Defining custom resources for use with OADP 1.2 Data Mover
When you install Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation, it automatically creates default CephFS and a CephRBD StorageClass and VolumeSnapshotClass custom resources (CRs). You must define these CRs for use with OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.2 Data Mover.

After you define the CRs, you must make several other changes to your environment before you can perform your back up and restore operations.

Defining CephFS custom resources for use with OADP 1.2 Data Mover
When you install Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation, it automatically creates a default CephFS StorageClass custom resource (CR) and a default CephFS VolumeSnapshotClass CR. You can define these CRs for use with OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.2 Data Mover.

Define the VolumeSnapshotClass CR as in the following example:

Define the StorageClass CR as in the following example:
Defining CephRBD custom resources for use with OADP 1.2 Data Mover
When you install Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation, it automatically creates a default CephRBD StorageClass custom resource (CR) and a default CephRBD VolumeSnapshotClass CR. You can define these CRs for use with OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.2 Data Mover.

Define the VolumeSnapshotClass CR as in the following example:

Define the StorageClass CR as in the following example:
Defining additional custom resources for use with OADP 1.2 Data Mover
After you redefine the default StorageClass and CephRBD VolumeSnapshotClass custom resources (CRs), you must create the following CRs:

A CephFS StorageClass CR defined to use the shallow copy feature

A Restic Secret CR


Create a CephFS StorageClass CR and set the backingSnapshot parameter set to true as in the following example:

Configure a Restic Secret CR as in the following example:
Backing up and restoring data using OADP 1.2 Data Mover and CephFS storage
You can use OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.2 Data Mover to back up and restore data using CephFS storage by enabling the shallow copy feature of CephFS.

A stateful application is running in a separate namespace with persistent volume claims (PVCs) using CephFS as the provisioner.

The StorageClass and VolumeSnapshotClass custom resources (CRs) are defined for CephFS and OADP 1.2 Data Mover.

There is a secret cloud-credentials in the openshift-adp namespace.


Creating a DPA for use with CephFS storage
You must create a Data Protection Application (DPA) CR before you use the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.2 Data Mover to back up and restore data using CephFS storage.

For the OADP 1.2 Data Mover, you must verify that the deletionPolicy field of the VolumeSnapshotClass CR is set to Retain by running the following command:

Verify that the labels of the VolumeSnapshotClass CR are set to true by running the following command:

Verify that the storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class annotation of the StorageClass CR is set to true by running the following command:

Create a Data Protection Application (DPA) CR similar to the following example:
Backing up data using OADP 1.2 Data Mover and CephFS storage
You can use OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.2 Data Mover to back up data using CephFS storage by enabling the shallow copy feature of CephFS storage.

Create a Backup CR as in the following example:

Monitor the progress of the VolumeSnapshotBackup CRs by completing the following steps:

Wait several minutes until the VolumeSnapshotBackup CR has the status Completed.

Verify that there is at least one snapshot in the object store that is given in the Restic Secret. You can check for this snapshot in your targeted BackupStorageLocation storage provider that has a prefix of /<OADP_namespace>.
Restoring data using OADP 1.2 Data Mover and CephFS storage
You can use OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.2 Data Mover to restore data using CephFS storage if the shallow copy feature of CephFS storage was enabled for the back up procedure. The shallow copy feature is not used in the restore procedure.

Delete the application namespace by running the following command:

Delete any VolumeSnapshotContent CRs that were created during backup by running the following command:

Create a Restore CR as in the following example:

Monitor the progress of the VolumeSnapshotRestore CRs by doing the following:

Verify that your application data has been restored by running the following command:
Backing up and restoring data using OADP 1.2 Data Mover and split volumes (CephFS and Ceph RBD)
You can use OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.2 Data Mover to backup and restore data in an environment that has split volumes, that is, an environment that uses both CephFS and CephRBD.

A stateful application is running in a separate namespace with persistent volume claims (PVCs) using CephFS as the provisioner.

The StorageClass and VolumeSnapshotClass custom resources (CRs) are defined for CephFS and OADP 1.2 Data Mover.

There is a secret cloud-credentials in the openshift-adp namespace.


Creating a DPA for use with split volumes
You must create a Data Protection Application (DPA) CR before you use the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.2 Data Mover to back up and restore data using split volumes.

Create a Data Protection Application (DPA) CR as in the following example:
Backing up data using OADP 1.2 Data Mover and split volumes
You can use OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.2 Data Mover to back up data in an environment that has split volumes.

Create a Backup CR as in the following example:

Monitor the progress of the VolumeSnapshotBackup CRs by completing the following steps:

Wait several minutes until the VolumeSnapshotBackup CR has the status Completed.

Verify that there is at least one snapshot in the object store that is given in the Restic Secret. You can check for this snapshot in your targeted BackupStorageLocation storage provider that has a prefix of /<OADP_namespace>.
Restoring data using OADP 1.2 Data Mover and split volumes
You can use OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.2 Data Mover to restore data in an environment that has split volumes, if the shallow copy feature of CephFS storage was enabled for the back up procedure. The shallow copy feature is not used in the restore procedure.

Delete the application namespace by running the following command:

Delete any VolumeSnapshotContent CRs that were created during backup by running the following command:

Create a Restore CR as in the following example:

Monitor the progress of the VolumeSnapshotRestore CRs by doing the following:

Verify that your application data has been restored by running the following command:
Deletion policy for OADP 1.2
The deletion policy determines rules for removing data from a system, specifying when and how deletion occurs based on factors such as retention periods, data sensitivity, and compliance requirements. It manages data removal effectively while meeting regulations and preserving valuable information.

Deletion policy guidelines for OADP 1.2
Review the following deletion policy guidelines for the OADP 1.2:

To use OADP 1.2.x Data Mover to backup and restore, set the deletionPolicy field to Retain in the VolumeSnapshotClass custom resource (CR).

In OADP 1.2.x, to use CSI backup and restore, you can set the deletionPolicy field to either Retain or Delete in the VolumeSnapshotClass CR.


OADP 1.2.x Data Mover to backup and restore is a Technology Preview feature and is not supported without a support exception.
