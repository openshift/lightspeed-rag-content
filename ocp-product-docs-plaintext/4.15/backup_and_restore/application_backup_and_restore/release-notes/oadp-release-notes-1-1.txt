OADP 1.1.7 release notes
The OADP 1.1.7 release notes lists any resolved issues and known issues.

Resolved issues
The following highlighted issues are resolved in OADP 1.1.7:

In previous releases of OADP 1.1, the HTTP/2 protocol was susceptible to a denial of service attack because request cancellation could reset multiple streams quickly. The server had to set up and tear down the streams while not hitting any server-side limit for the maximum number of active streams per connection. This resulted in a denial of service due to server resource consumption. For a list of all OADP issues associated with this CVE, see the following Jira list.

For more information, see CVE-2023-39325 (Rapid Reset Attack).

Known issues

OADP 1.1.6 release notes
The OADP 1.1.6 release notes lists any new features, resolved issues and bugs, and known issues.

Resolved issues
OCP 4.14 introduced pod security standards that meant the privileged profile is enforced. In previous releases of OADP, this profile caused the pod to receive permission denied errors. This issue was caused because of the restore order. The pod was created before the security context constraints (SCC) resource. As this pod violated the pod security standard, the pod was denied and subsequently failed. OADP-2420

In previous releases of OADP, the restore of job resource was partially failing in OCP 4.14. This issue was not seen in older OCP versions. The issue was caused by an additional label being to the job resource, which was not present in older OCP versions. OADP-2530

New features
This version of OADP is a service release. No new features are added to this version.
Resolved issues
In previous releases of OADP, OADP did not facilitate the support of all the upstream Velero server arguments. This issue has been resolved in OADP 1.1.4 and all the upstream Velero server arguments are supported. OADP-1557

In previous releases of OADP, OADP Data Mover could restore from an incorrect snapshot if there was more than one Volume Snapshot Restore (VSR) resource in the cluster for the same Velero restore name and PersistentVolumeClaim (pvc) name. OADP-1822

In previous releases of OADP, ACM BackupSchedules failed validation because of a missing OwnerReference on Backup Storage Locations (BSLs) created with dpa.spec.backupLocations.bucket. OADP-1511

For a complete list of all issues resolved in this release, see the list of OADP 1.1.4 resolved issues in Jira.
Known issues
This release has the following known issues:

OADP backups might fail because a UID/GID range might have changed on the cluster where the application has been restored, with the result that OADP does not back up and restore Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform UID/GID range metadata. To avoid the issue, if the backed application requires a specific UUID, ensure the range is available when restored. An additional workaround is to allow OADP to create the namespace in the restore operation.

A restoration might fail if ArgoCD is used during the process due to a label used by ArgoCD, app.kubernetes.io/instance. This label identifies which resources ArgoCD needs to manage, which can create a conflict with OADP's procedure for managing resources on restoration. To work around this issue, set .spec.resourceTrackingMethod on the ArgoCD YAML to annotation+label or annotation. If the issue continues to persist, then disable ArgoCD before beginning to restore, and enable it again when restoration is finished.

Velero plugins are started as separate processes. When the Velero operation has completed, either successfully or not, they exit. Therefore if you see a received EOF, stopping recv loop messages in debug logs, it does not mean an error occurred. The message indicates that a plugin operation has completed. OADP-2176
