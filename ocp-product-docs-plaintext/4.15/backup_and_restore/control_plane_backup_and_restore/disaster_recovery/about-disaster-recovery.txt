About disaster recovery

The disaster recovery documentation provides information for administrators on how to recover from several disaster situations that might occur with their Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. As an administrator, you might need to follow one or more of the following procedures to return your cluster to a working state.

Disaster recovery requires you to have at least one healthy control plane host.

Restoring to a previous cluster state
This solution handles situations where you want to restore your cluster to
a previous state, for example, if an administrator deletes something critical.
This also includes situations where you have lost the majority of your control plane hosts, leading to etcd quorum loss and the cluster going offline. As long as you have taken an etcd backup, you can follow this procedure to restore your cluster to a previous state.
Recovering from expired control plane certificates
This solution handles situations where your control plane certificates have
expired. For example, if you shut down your cluster before the first certificate
rotation, which occurs 24 hours after installation, your certificates will not
be rotated and will expire. You can follow this procedure to recover from
expired control plane certificates.
