Adding compute machines to AWS by using CloudFormation templates

You can add more compute machines to your "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS) that you created by using the sample CloudFormation templates.
Prerequisites
You installed your cluster on AWS by using the provided AWS CloudFormation templates.

You have the JSON file and CloudFormation template that you used to create the compute machines during cluster installation. If you do not have these files, you must recreate them by following the instructions in the installation procedure.
Adding more compute machines to your AWS cluster by using CloudFormation templates
You can add more compute machines to your "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS) that you created by using the sample CloudFormation templates.

The CloudFormation template creates a stack that represents one compute machine. You must create a stack for each compute machine.
If you do not use the provided CloudFormation template to create your compute nodes, you must review the provided information and manually create the infrastructure. If your cluster does not initialize correctly, you might have to contact Red Hat support with your installation logs.
You installed an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster by using CloudFormation templates and have access to the JSON file and CloudFormation template that you used to create the compute machines during cluster installation.

You installed the AWS CLI.


Create another compute stack.

Continue to create compute stacks until you have created enough compute machines for your cluster.
Approving the certificate signing requests for your machines
When you add machines to a cluster, two pending certificate signing requests (CSRs) are generated for each machine that you added. You must confirm that these CSRs are approved or, if necessary, approve them yourself. The client requests must be approved first, followed by the server requests.

You added machines to your cluster.


Confirm that the cluster recognizes the machines:

Review the pending CSRs and ensure that you see the client requests with the Pending or Approved status for each machine that you added to the cluster:

If the CSRs were not approved, after all of the pending CSRs for the machines you added are in Pending status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines:

Now that your client requests are approved, you must review the server requests for each machine that you added to the cluster:

If the remaining CSRs are not approved, and are in the Pending status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines:

After all client and server CSRs have been approved, the machines have the Ready status. Verify this by running the following command:
