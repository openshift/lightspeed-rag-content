Overview of machine management

You can use machine management to flexibly work with underlying infrastructure such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP), and VMware vSphere to manage the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster. You can control the cluster and perform auto-scaling, such as scaling up and down the cluster based on specific workload policies.

It is important to have a cluster that adapts to changing workloads. The "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster can horizontally scale up and down when the load increases or decreases.

Machine management is implemented as a custom resource definition (CRD). A CRD object defines a new unique object Kind in the cluster and enables the Kubernetes API server to handle the object's entire lifecycle.

The Machine API Operator provisions the following resources:

MachineSet

Machine

ClusterAutoscaler

MachineAutoscaler

MachineHealthCheck
Machine API overview
The Machine API is a combination of primary resources that are based on the upstream Cluster API project and custom "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" resources.

For "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" "4.15" clusters, the Machine API performs all node host provisioning management actions after the cluster installation finishes. Because of this system, "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" "4.15" offers an elastic, dynamic provisioning method on top of public or private cloud infrastructure.

The two primary resources are:


Machines
A fundamental unit that describes the host for a node. A machine has a providerSpec specification, which describes the types of compute nodes that are offered for different cloud platforms. For example, a machine type for a compute node might define a specific machine type and required metadata.
Machine sets
MachineSet resources are groups of compute machines. Compute machine sets are to compute machines as replica sets are to pods. If you need more compute machines or must scale them down, you change the replicas field on the MachineSet resource to meet your compute need.


The following custom resources add more capabilities to your cluster:


Machine autoscaler
The MachineAutoscaler resource automatically scales compute machines in a cloud. You can set the minimum and maximum scaling boundaries for nodes in a specified compute machine set, and the machine autoscaler maintains that range of nodes.
Cluster autoscaler
This resource is based on the upstream cluster autoscaler project. In the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" implementation, it is integrated with the Machine API by extending the compute machine set API. You can use the cluster autoscaler to manage your cluster in the following ways:
Machine health check
The MachineHealthCheck resource detects when a machine is unhealthy, deletes it, and, on supported platforms, makes a new machine.


In "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" version 3.11, you could not roll out a multi-zone architecture easily because the cluster did not manage machine provisioning. Beginning with "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" version 4.1, this process is easier. Each compute machine set is scoped to a single zone, so the installation program sends out compute machine sets across availability zones on your behalf. And then because your compute is dynamic, and in the face of a zone failure, you always have a zone for when you must rebalance your machines. In global Azure regions that do not have multiple availability zones, you can use availability sets to ensure high availability. The autoscaler provides best-effort balancing over the life of a cluster.

Machine phases and lifecycle
Managing compute machines
As a cluster administrator, you can perform the following actions:

Create a compute machine set for the following cloud providers:

Create a machine set for a bare metal deployment: Creating a compute machine set on bare metal

Manually scale a compute machine set by adding or removing a machine from the compute machine set.

Modify a compute machine set through the MachineSet YAML configuration file.

Delete a machine.

Create infrastructure compute machine sets.

Configure and deploy a machine health check to automatically fix damaged machines in a machine pool.
Managing control plane machines
As a cluster administrator, you can perform the following actions:

Update your control plane configuration with a control plane machine set for the following cloud providers:

Configure and deploy a machine health check to automatically recover unhealthy control plane machines.
Applying autoscaling to an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster
You can automatically scale your "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster to ensure flexibility for changing workloads. To autoscale your cluster, you must first deploy a cluster autoscaler, and then deploy a machine autoscaler for each compute machine set.

The cluster autoscaler increases and decreases the size of the cluster based on deployment needs.

The machine autoscaler adjusts the number of machines in the compute machine sets that you deploy in your "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster.
Adding compute machines on user-provisioned infrastructure
User-provisioned infrastructure is an environment where you can deploy infrastructure such as compute, network, and storage resources that host the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform". You can add compute machines to a cluster on user-provisioned infrastructure during or after the installation process.
Adding RHEL compute machines to your cluster
As a cluster administrator, you can perform the following actions:

Add Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) compute machines, also known as worker machines, to a user-provisioned infrastructure cluster or an installation-provisioned infrastructure cluster.

Add more Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) compute machines to an existing cluster.
