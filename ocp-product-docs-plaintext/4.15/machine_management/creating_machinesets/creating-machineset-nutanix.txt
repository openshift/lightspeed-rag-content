Creating a compute machine set on Nutanix

You can create a different compute machine set to serve a specific purpose in your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on Nutanix. For example, you might create infrastructure machine sets and related machines so that you can move supporting workloads to the new machines.

You can use the advanced machine management and scaling capabilities only in clusters where the Machine API is operational. Clusters with user-provisioned infrastructure require additional validation and configuration to use the Machine API.

Clusters with the infrastructure platform type none cannot use the Machine API. This limitation applies even if the compute machines that are attached to the cluster are installed on a platform that supports the feature. This parameter cannot be changed after installation.

To view the platform type for your cluster, run the following command:

$ oc get infrastructure cluster -o jsonpath='{.status.platform}'
Sample YAML for a compute machine set custom resource on Nutanix
This sample YAML defines a Nutanix compute machine set that creates nodes that are labeled with node-role.kubernetes.io/<role>: "".

In this sample, <infrastructure_id> is the infrastructure ID label that is based on the cluster ID that you set when you provisioned the cluster, and <role> is the node label to add.


In the following example, you can obtain some of the values for your cluster by using the OpenShift CLI (oc).


Infrastructure ID
The <infrastructure_id> string is the infrastructure ID that is based on the cluster ID that you set when you provisioned the cluster. If you have the OpenShift CLI installed, you can obtain the infrastructure ID by running the following command:


apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1

            uuid: <cluster_uuid>
          credentialsSecret:

            uuid: <subnet_uuid>
          systemDiskSize: 120Gi 11
          userDataSecret:

          vcpuSockets: 4 13
          vcpusPerSocket: 1 14
For <infrastructure_id>, specify the infrastructure ID that is based on the cluster ID that you set when you provisioned the cluster.

Specify the node label to add.

Specify the infrastructure ID, node label, and zone.

Annotations for the cluster autoscaler.

Specifies the boot type that the compute machines use. For more information about boot types, see Understanding UEFI, Secure Boot, and TPM in the Virtualized Environment. Valid values are Legacy, SecureBoot, or UEFI. The default is Legacy.

Specify one or more Nutanix Prism categories to apply to compute machines. This stanza requires key and value parameters for a category key-value pair that exists in Prism Central. For more information about categories, see Category management.

Specify a Nutanix Prism Element cluster configuration. In this example, the cluster type is uuid, so there is a uuid stanza.

Specify the image to use. Use an image from an existing default compute machine set for the cluster.

Specify the amount of memory for the cluster in Gi.

Specify the Nutanix project that you use for your cluster. In this example, the project type is name, so there is a name stanza.

Specify the size of the system disk in Gi.

Specify the name of the secret in the user data YAML file that is in the openshift-machine-api namespace. Use the value that installation program populates in the default compute machine set.

Specify the number of vCPU sockets.

Specify the number of vCPUs per socket.
Creating a compute machine set
In addition to the compute machine sets created by the installation program, you can create your own to dynamically manage the machine compute resources for specific workloads of your choice.

Deploy an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

Log in to oc as a user with cluster-admin permission.


Create a new YAML file that contains the compute machine set custom resource (CR) sample and is named <file_name>.yaml.

Optional: If you are not sure which value to set for a specific field, you can check an existing compute machine set from your cluster.

Create a MachineSet CR by running the following command:


View the list of compute machine sets by running the following command:
Failure domains for Nutanix clusters
To add or update the failure domain configuration on a Nutanix cluster, you must make coordinated changes to several resources. The following actions are required:

Modify the cluster infrastructure custom resource (CR).

Modify the cluster control plane machine set CR.

Modify or replace the compute machine set CRs.
