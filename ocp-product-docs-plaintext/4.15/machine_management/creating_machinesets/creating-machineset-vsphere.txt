Creating a compute machine set on vSphere

You can create a different compute machine set to serve a specific purpose in your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on VMware vSphere. For example, you might create infrastructure machine sets and related machines so that you can move supporting workloads to the new machines.

You can use the advanced machine management and scaling capabilities only in clusters where the Machine API is operational. Clusters with user-provisioned infrastructure require additional validation and configuration to use the Machine API.

Clusters with the infrastructure platform type none cannot use the Machine API. This limitation applies even if the compute machines that are attached to the cluster are installed on a platform that supports the feature. This parameter cannot be changed after installation.

To view the platform type for your cluster, run the following command:

$ oc get infrastructure cluster -o jsonpath='{.status.platform}'
Sample YAML for a compute machine set custom resource on vSphere
This sample YAML defines a compute machine set that runs on VMware vSphere and creates nodes that are labeled with node-role.kubernetes.io/<role>: "".

In this sample, <infrastructure_id> is the infrastructure ID label that is based on the cluster ID that you set when you provisioned the cluster, and <role> is the node label to add.

Specify the infrastructure ID that is based on the cluster ID that you set when you provisioned the cluster. If you have the OpenShift CLI (oc) installed, you can obtain the infrastructure ID by running the following command:

Specify the infrastructure ID and node label.

Specify the node label to add.

Specify the vSphere VM network to deploy the compute machine set to. This VM network must be where other compute machines reside in the cluster.

Specify the vSphere VM template to use, such as user-5ddjd-rhcos.

Specify the vCenter Datacenter to deploy the compute machine set on.

Specify the vCenter Datastore to deploy the compute machine set on.

Specify the path to the vSphere VM folder in vCenter, such as /dc1/vm/user-inst-5ddjd.

Specify the vSphere resource pool for your VMs.

Specify the vCenter server IP or fully qualified domain name.
Minimum required vCenter privileges for compute machine set management
To manage compute machine sets in an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on vCenter, you must use an account with privileges to read, create, and delete the required resources. Using an account that has global administrative privileges is the simplest way to access all of the necessary permissions.

If you cannot use an account with global administrative privileges, you must create roles to grant the minimum required privileges. The following table lists the minimum vCenter roles and privileges that are required to create, scale, and delete compute machine sets and to delete machines in your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.


The following table details the permissions and propagation settings that are required for compute machine set management.


For more information about creating an account with only the required privileges, see vSphere Permissions and User Management Tasks in the vSphere documentation.
Requirements for clusters with user-provisioned infrastructure to use compute machine sets
To use compute machine sets on clusters that have user-provisioned infrastructure, you must ensure that you cluster configuration supports using the Machine API.


To create compute machine sets, you must be able to supply the infrastructure ID for your cluster.

To obtain the infrastructure ID for your cluster, run the following command:



To use compute machine sets, the Machine API must be able to interact with vCenter. Credentials that authorize the Machine API components to interact with vCenter must exist in a secret in the openshift-machine-api namespace.

To determine whether the required credentials exist, run the following command:

If the secret does not exist, create it by running the following command:



Provisioning virtual machines (VMs) requires a valid Ignition configuration. The Ignition configuration contains the machine-config-server address and a system trust bundle for obtaining further Ignition configurations from the Machine Config Operator.

By default, this configuration is stored in the worker-user-data secret in the machine-api-operator namespace. Compute machine sets reference the secret during the machine creation process.

To determine whether the required secret exists, run the following command:

If the secret does not exist, create it by running the following command:


Understanding the Machine Config Operator

Installing RHCOS and starting the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform bootstrap process
Creating a compute machine set
In addition to the compute machine sets created by the installation program, you can create your own to dynamically manage the machine compute resources for specific workloads of your choice.

Clusters that are installed with user-provisioned infrastructure have a different networking stack than clusters with infrastructure that is provisioned by the installation program. As a result of this difference, automatic load balancer management is unsupported on clusters that have user-provisioned infrastructure. For these clusters, a compute machine set can only create worker and infra type machines.
Deploy an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

Log in to oc as a user with cluster-admin permission.

Have the necessary permissions to deploy VMs in your vCenter instance and have the required access to the datastore specified.

If your cluster uses user-provisioned infrastructure, you have satisfied the specific Machine API requirements for that configuration.


Create a new YAML file that contains the compute machine set custom resource (CR) sample and is named <file_name>.yaml.

Optional: If you are not sure which value to set for a specific field, you can check an existing compute machine set from your cluster.

Create a MachineSet CR by running the following command:
