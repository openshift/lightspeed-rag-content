Creating a compute machine set on IBM Cloud

You can create a different compute machine set to serve a specific purpose in your "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster on IBM Cloud&#174;. For example, you might create infrastructure machine sets and related machines so that you can move supporting workloads to the new machines.

You can use the advanced machine management and scaling capabilities only in clusters where the Machine API is operational. Clusters with user-provisioned infrastructure require additional validation and configuration to use the Machine API.

Clusters with the infrastructure platform type none cannot use the Machine API. This limitation applies even if the compute machines that are attached to the cluster are installed on a platform that supports the feature. This parameter cannot be changed after installation.

To view the platform type for your cluster, run the following command:

$ oc get infrastructure cluster -o jsonpath='{.status.platform}'
Sample YAML for a compute machine set custom resource on IBM Cloud
This sample YAML defines a compute machine set that runs in a specified IBM Cloud&#174; zone in a region and creates nodes that are labeled with node-role.kubernetes.io/<role>: "".

In this sample, <infrastructure_id> is the infrastructure ID label that is based on the cluster ID that you set when you provisioned the cluster, and <role> is the node label to add.

The infrastructure ID that is based on the cluster ID that you set when you provisioned the cluster. If you have the OpenShift CLI installed, you can obtain the infrastructure ID by running the following command:

The node label to add.

The infrastructure ID, node label, and region.

The custom Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) image that was used for cluster installation.

The infrastructure ID and zone within your region to place machines on. Be sure that your region supports the zone that you specify.

Specify the IBM Cloud&#174; instance profile.

Specify the region to place machines on.

The resource group that machine resources are placed in. This is either an existing resource group specified at installation time, or an installer-created resource group named based on the infrastructure ID.

The VPC name.

Specify the zone within your region to place machines on. Be sure that your region supports the zone that you specify.
Creating a compute machine set
In addition to the compute machine sets created by the installation program, you can create your own to dynamically manage the machine compute resources for specific workloads of your choice.

Deploy an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster.

Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

Log in to oc as a user with cluster-admin permission.


Create a new YAML file that contains the compute machine set custom resource (CR) sample and is named <file_name>.yaml.

Optional: If you are not sure which value to set for a specific field, you can check an existing compute machine set from your cluster.

Create a MachineSet CR by running the following command:
