Managing machines with the Cluster API

Managing machines with the Cluster API is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
The Cluster API is an upstream project that is integrated into "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" as a Technology Preview for Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). You can use the Cluster API to create and manage compute machine sets and compute machines in your "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster. This capability is in addition or an alternative to managing machines with the Machine API.

For "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" {product-version} clusters, you can use the Cluster API to perform node host provisioning management actions after the cluster installation finishes. This system enables an elastic, dynamic provisioning method on top of public or private cloud infrastructure.

With the Cluster API Technology Preview, you can create compute machines and compute machine sets on "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" clusters for supported providers. You can also explore the features that are enabled by this implementation that might not be available with the Machine API.


By using the Cluster API, "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" users and developers are able to realize the following advantages:

The option to use upstream community Cluster API infrastructure providers which might not be supported by the Machine API.

The opportunity to collaborate with third parties who maintain machine controllers for infrastructure providers.

The ability to use the same set of Kubernetes tools for infrastructure management in "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform".

The ability to create compute machine sets by using the Cluster API that support features that are not available with the Machine API.



Using the Cluster API to manage machines is a Technology Preview feature and has the following limitations:

Only AWS and GCP clusters are supported.

To use this feature, you must enable the TechPreviewNoUpgrade feature set. Enabling this feature set cannot be undone and prevents minor version updates.

You must create the primary resources that the Cluster API requires manually.

You cannot manage control plane machines by using the Cluster API.

Migration of existing compute machine sets created by the Machine API to Cluster API compute machine sets is not supported.

Full feature parity with the Machine API is not available.
Cluster API architecture
The "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" integration of the upstream Cluster API is implemented and managed by the Cluster CAPI Operator. The Cluster CAPI Operator and its operands are provisioned in the openshift-cluster-api namespace, in contrast to the Machine API, which uses the openshift-machine-api namespace.

The Cluster CAPI Operator
The Cluster CAPI Operator is an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" Operator that maintains the lifecycle of Cluster API resources. This Operator is responsible for all administrative tasks related to deploying the Cluster API project within an "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster.

If a cluster is configured correctly to allow the use of the Cluster API, the Cluster CAPI Operator installs the Cluster API components on the cluster.

For more information, see the "Cluster CAPI Operator" entry in the Cluster Operators reference content.

Cluster CAPI Operator
Cluster API primary resources
The Cluster API consists of the following primary resources. For the Technology Preview of this feature, you must create these resources manually in the openshift-cluster-api namespace.


Cluster
A fundamental unit that represents a cluster that is managed by the Cluster API.
Infrastructure
A provider-specific resource that defines properties that are shared by all the compute machine sets in the cluster, such as the region and subnets.
Machine template
A provider-specific template that defines the properties of the machines that a compute machine set creates.
Machine set
A group of machines.
Machine
A fundamental unit that describes the host for a node.
Sample YAML files
For the Cluster API Technology Preview, you must create the primary resources that the Cluster API requires manually. The following example YAML files show how to make these resources work together and configure settings for the machines that they create that are appropriate for your environment.

Troubleshooting clusters that use the Cluster API
Use the information in this section to understand and recover from issues you might encounter. Generally, troubleshooting steps for problems with the Cluster API are similar to those steps for problems with the Machine API.

The Cluster CAPI Operator and its operands are provisioned in the openshift-cluster-api namespace, whereas the Machine API uses the openshift-machine-api namespace. When using oc commands that reference a namespace, be sure to reference the correct one.

CLI commands return Cluster API machines
For clusters that use the Cluster API, oc commands such as oc get machine return results for Cluster API machines. Because the letter c precedes the letter m alphabetically, Cluster API machines appear in the return before Machine API machines do.

To list only Machine API machines, use the fully qualified name machines.machine.openshift.io when running the oc get machine command:

To list only Cluster API machines, use the fully qualified name machines.cluster.x-k8s.io when running the oc get machine command:
