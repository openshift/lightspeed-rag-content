Cluster API configuration

Managing machines with the Cluster API is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
The following example YAML files show how to make the Cluster API primary resources work together and configure settings for the machines that they create that are appropriate for your environment.
Sample YAML for a Cluster API cluster resource
The cluster resource defines the name and infrastructure provider for the cluster and is managed by the Cluster API. This resource has the same structure for all providers.

apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1

  namespace: openshift-cluster-api
spec:
  infrastructureRef:
    apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: <infrastructure_kind> 2
    name: <cluster_name>
    namespace: openshift-cluster-api
