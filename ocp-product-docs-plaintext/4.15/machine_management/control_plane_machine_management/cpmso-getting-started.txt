Getting started with control plane machine sets

The process for getting started with control plane machine sets depends on the state of the ControlPlaneMachineSet custom resource (CR) in your cluster.


Clusters with an active generated CR
Clusters that have a generated CR with an active state use the control plane machine set by default. No administrator action is required.
Clusters with an inactive generated CR
For clusters that include an inactive generated CR, you must review the CR configuration and activate the CR.
Clusters without a generated CR
For clusters that do not include a generated CR, you must create and activate a CR with the appropriate configuration for your cluster.


If you are uncertain about the state of the ControlPlaneMachineSet CR in your cluster, you can verify the CR status.
Supported cloud providers
In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15, the control plane machine set is supported for Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, Nutanix, and VMware vSphere clusters.

The status of the control plane machine set after installation depends on your cloud provider and the version of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform that you installed on your cluster.


AWS clusters that are upgraded from version 4.11 or earlier require CR activation.

GCP and Azure clusters that are upgraded from version 4.12 or earlier require CR activation.

Nutanix and RHOSP clusters that are upgraded from version 4.13 or earlier require CR activation.

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.15, installing a cluster with an active generated CR on VWware vSphere is available as a Technology Preview feature. To enable the feature, set the featureSet parameter to TechPreviewNoUpgrade in the install-config.yaml file.
Checking the control plane machine set custom resource state
You can verify the existence and state of the ControlPlaneMachineSet custom resource (CR).

Determine the state of the CR by running the following command:


To use the control plane machine set, you must ensure that a ControlPlaneMachineSet CR with the correct settings for your cluster exists.

If your cluster has an existing CR, you must verify that the configuration in the CR is correct for your cluster.

If your cluster does not have an existing CR, you must create one with the correct configuration for your cluster.
Activating the control plane machine set custom resource
To use the control plane machine set, you must ensure that a ControlPlaneMachineSet custom resource (CR) with the correct settings for your cluster exists. On a cluster with a generated CR, you must verify that the configuration in the CR is correct for your cluster and activate it.

For more information about the parameters in the CR, see "Control plane machine set configuration".
View the configuration of the CR by running the following command:

Change the values of any fields that are incorrect for your cluster configuration.

When the configuration is correct, activate the CR by setting the .spec.state field to Active and saving your changes.

Creating a control plane machine set custom resource
To use the control plane machine set, you must ensure that a ControlPlaneMachineSet custom resource (CR) with the correct settings for your cluster exists. On a cluster without a generated CR, you must create the CR manually and activate it.

For more information about the structure and parameters of the CR, see "Control plane machine set configuration".
Create a YAML file using the following template:

Refer to the sample YAML for a control plane machine set CR and populate your file with values that are appropriate for your cluster configuration.

Refer to the sample failure domain configuration and sample provider specification for your cloud provider and update those sections of your file with the appropriate values.

When the configuration is correct, activate the CR by setting the .spec.state field to Active and saving your changes.

Create the CR from your YAML file by running the following command:
