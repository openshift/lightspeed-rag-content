Control plane machine set configuration

These example YAML snippets show the base structure for a control plane machine set custom resource (CR) and platform-specific samples for provider specification and failure domain configurations.

The <platform_provider_spec> and <platform_failure_domains> sections of the control plane machine set resources are provider-specific. Refer to the example YAML for your cluster:

Some sections of the control plane machine set CR are provider-specific. The following example YAML snippets show provider specification and failure domain configurations for an Amazon Web Services (AWS) cluster.

Sample AWS provider specification
When you create a control plane machine set for an existing cluster, the provider specification must match the providerSpec configuration in the control plane machine custom resource (CR) that is created by the installation program. You can omit any field that is set in the failure domain section of the CR.

In the following example, <cluster_id> is the infrastructure ID that is based on the cluster ID that you set when you provisioned the cluster. If you have the OpenShift CLI installed, you can obtain the infrastructure ID by running the following command:

Specifies the vCenter server IP or fully qualified domain name.
Sample VMware vSphere failure domain configuration
On VMware vSphere infrastructure, the cluster-wide infrastructure Custom Resource Definition (CRD), infrastructures.config.openshift.io, defines failure domains for your cluster. The providerSpec in the ControlPlaneMachineSet custom resource (CR) specifies names for failure domains. A failure domain is an infrastructure resource that comprises a control plane machine set, a vCenter datacenter, vCenter datastore, and a network.

By using a failure domain resource, you can use a control plane machine set to deploy control plane machines on hardware that is separate from the primary VMware vSphere infrastructure. A control plane machine set also balances control plane machines across defined failure domains to provide fault tolerance capabilities to your infrastructure.

If you modify the ProviderSpec configuration in the ControlPlaneMachineSet CR, the control plane machine set updates all control plane machines deployed on the primary infrastructure and each failure domain infrastructure.
Defining a failure domain for a control plane machine set is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

A failure domain defines the vCenter location for "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" cluster nodes.

Defines failure domains by name for the control plane machine set.


Each failureDomains.platform.vsphere.name field value in the ControlPlaneMachineSet CR must match the corresponding value defined in the failureDomains.name field of the cluster-wide infrastructure CRD. Currently, the vsphere.name field is the only supported failure domain field that you can specify in the ControlPlaneMachineSet CR.
For an example of a cluster-wide infrastructure CRD that defines resources for each failure domain, see Specifying multiple regions and zones for your cluster on vSphere
Sample YAML for configuring Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) clusters
Some sections of the control plane machine set CR are provider-specific. The following example YAML snippets show provider specification and failure domain configurations for an RHOSP cluster.

Sample RHOSP provider specification
When you create a control plane machine set for an existing cluster, the provider specification must match the providerSpec configuration in the control plane machine custom resource (CR) that is created by the installation program.

The control plane machines security group.
Sample RHOSP failure domain configuration
The control plane machine set concept of a failure domain is analogous to the existing Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) concept of an availability zone. The ControlPlaneMachineSet CR spreads control plane machines across multiple failure domains when possible.

The following example demonstrates the use of multiple Nova availability zones as well as Cinder availability zones.
