Control plane configuration options for Microsoft Azure

You can change the configuration of your Microsoft Azure control plane machines and enable features by updating values in the control plane machine set. When you save an update to the control plane machine set, the Control Plane Machine Set Operator updates the control plane machines according to your configured update strategy.
Sample YAML for configuring Microsoft Azure clusters
The following example YAML snippets show provider specification and failure domain configurations for an Azure cluster.

Sample Azure provider specification
When you create a control plane machine set for an existing cluster, the provider specification must match the providerSpec configuration in the control plane Machine CR that is created by the installation program. You can omit any field that is set in the failure domain section of the CR.

In the following example, <cluster_id> is the infrastructure ID that is based on the cluster ID that you set when you provisioned the cluster. If you have the OpenShift CLI installed, you can obtain the infrastructure ID by running the following command:

$ oc get -o jsonpath='{.status.infrastructureName}{"\n"}' infrastructure cluster
apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1
kind: ControlPlaneMachineSet

            apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
            credentialsSecret:
              name: azure-cloud-credentials 1
              namespace: openshift-machine-api
            diagnostics: {}
            image: 2
              offer: ""
              publisher: ""

              version: ""
            internalLoadBalancer: <cluster_id>-internal 4
            kind: AzureMachineProviderSpec 5
            location: <region> 6
            managedIdentity: <cluster_id>-identity
            metadata:
              creationTimestamp: null
              name: <cluster_id>

            vmSize: Standard_D8s_v3
            vnet: <cluster_id>-vnet
            zone: "1" 11
Specifies the secret name for the cluster. Do not change this value.

Specifies the image details for your control plane machine set.

Specifies an image that is compatible with your instance type. The Hyper-V generation V2 images created by the installation program have a -gen2 suffix, while V1 images have the same name without the suffix.

Specifies the internal load balancer for the control plane. This field might not be preconfigured but is required in both the ControlPlaneMachineSet and control plane Machine CRs.

Specifies the cloud provider platform type. Do not change this value.

Specifies the region to place control plane machines on.

Specifies the disk configuration for the control plane.

Specifies the public load balancer for the control plane.

Specifies the subnet for the control plane.

Specifies the control plane user data secret. Do not change this value.

Specifies the zone configuration for clusters that use a single zone for all failure domains.
Sample Azure failure domain configuration
The control plane machine set concept of a failure domain is analogous to existing Azure concept of an Azure availability zone. The ControlPlaneMachineSet CR spreads control plane machines across multiple failure domains when possible.

When configuring Azure failure domains in the control plane machine set, you must specify the availability zone name. An Azure cluster uses a single subnet that spans multiple zones.

apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1
kind: ControlPlaneMachineSet
metadata:
  name: cluster
  namespace: openshift-machine-api
spec:
# ...
  template:
# ...
    machines_v1beta1_machine_openshift_io:
      failureDomains:
        azure:
        - zone: "1" 1
        - zone: "2"
        - zone: "3"
        platform: Azure 2
# ...
Each instance of zone specifies an Azure availability zone for a failure domain.

Specifies the cloud provider platform name. Do not change this value.
Enabling Microsoft Azure features for control plane machines
You can enable the following features by updating values in the control plane machine set.

Restricting the API server to private
After you deploy a cluster to Microsoft Azure, you can reconfigure the API server to use only the private zone.

Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

Have access to the web console as a user with admin privileges.


In the web portal or console for your cloud provider, take the following actions:


Configuring the Ingress Controller endpoint publishing scope to Internal
Using the Azure Marketplace offering
You can create a machine set running on Azure that deploys machines that use the Azure Marketplace offering. To use this offering, you must first obtain the Azure Marketplace image. When obtaining your image, consider the following:

While the images are the same, the Azure Marketplace publisher is different depending on your region. If you are located in North America, specify redhat as the publisher. If you are located in EMEA, specify redhat-limited as the publisher.

The offer includes a rh-ocp-worker SKU and a rh-ocp-worker-gen1 SKU. The rh-ocp-worker SKU represents a Hyper-V generation version 2 VM image. The default instance types used in "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" are version 2 compatible. If you plan to use an instance type that is only version 1 compatible, use the image associated with the rh-ocp-worker-gen1 SKU. The rh-ocp-worker-gen1 SKU represents a Hyper-V version 1 VM image.


Installing images with the Azure marketplace is not supported on clusters with 64-bit ARM instances.
You have installed the Azure CLI client (az).

Your Azure account is entitled for the offer and you have logged into this account with the Azure CLI client.

Enabling Azure boot diagnostics
You can enable boot diagnostics on Azure machines that your machine set creates.

Have an existing Microsoft Azure
cluster.


Add the diagnostics configuration that is applicable to your storage type to the providerSpec field in your machine set YAML file:


On the Microsoft Azure portal, review the Boot diagnostics page for a machine deployed by the machine set, and verify that you can see the serial logs for the machine.
Machine sets that deploy machines with ultra disks as data disks
You can create a machine set running on Azure that deploys machines with ultra disks. Ultra disks are high-performance storage that are intended for use with the most demanding data workloads.

Microsoft Azure ultra disks documentation


Creating machines with ultra disks by using machine sets
You can deploy machines with ultra disks on Azure by editing your machine set YAML file.

Have an existing Microsoft Azure cluster.


Create a custom secret in the openshift-machine-api namespace using the master data secret by running the following command:

In a text editor, open the userData.txt file and locate the final } character in the file.

Extract the disabling template value to a file called disableTemplating.txt by running the following command:

Combine the userData.txt file and disableTemplating.txt file to create a data secret file by running the following command:

Edit your control plane machine set CR by running the following command:

Add the following lines in the positions indicated:

To use an ultra disk on the control plane, reconfigure your workload to use the control plane's ultra disk mount point.
Troubleshooting resources for machine sets that enable ultra disks
Use the information in this section to understand and recover from issues you might encounter.

Incorrect ultra disk configuration
If an incorrect configuration of the ultraSSDCapability parameter is specified in the machine set, the machine provisioning fails.

For example, if the ultraSSDCapability parameter is set to Disabled, but an ultra disk is specified in the dataDisks parameter, the following error message appears:

StorageAccountType UltraSSD_LRS can be used only when additionalCapabilities.ultraSSDEnabled is set.
To resolve this issue, verify that your machine set configuration is correct.
Unsupported disk parameters
If a region, availability zone, or instance size that is not compatible with ultra disks is specified in the machine set, the machine provisioning fails. Check the logs for the following error message:

failed to create vm <machine_name>: failure sending request for machine <machine_name>: cannot create vm: compute.VirtualMachinesClient#CreateOrUpdate: Failure sending request: StatusCode=400 -- Original Error: Code="BadRequest" Message="Storage Account type 'UltraSSD_LRS' is not supported <more_information_about_why>."
To resolve this issue, verify that you are using this feature in a supported environment and that your machine set configuration is correct.
Unable to delete disks
If the deletion of ultra disks as data disks is not working as expected, the machines are deleted and the data disks are orphaned. You must delete the orphaned disks manually if desired.
Enabling customer-managed encryption keys for a machine set
You can supply an encryption key to Azure to encrypt data on managed disks at rest. You can enable server-side encryption with customer-managed keys by using the Machine API.

An Azure Key Vault, a disk encryption set, and an encryption key are required to use a customer-managed key. The disk encryption set must be in a resource group where the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) has granted permissions. If not, an additional reader role is required to be granted on the disk encryption set.

Create an Azure Key Vault instance.

Create an instance of a disk encryption set.

Grant the disk encryption set access to key vault.


Configure the disk encryption set under the providerSpec field in your machine set YAML file. For example:

Configuring trusted launch for Azure virtual machines by using machine sets
Using trusted launch for Azure virtual machines is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
"Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" "4.15" supports trusted launch for Azure virtual machines (VMs). By editing the machine set YAML file, you can configure the trusted launch options that a machine set uses for machines that it deploys. For example, you can configure these machines to use UEFI security features such as Secure Boot or a dedicated virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) instance.

Some feature combinations result in an invalid configuration.

Using the secureBoot field.

Using the virtualizedTrustedPlatformModule field.
For more information about related features and functionality, see the Microsoft Azure documentation about Trusted launch for Azure virtual machines.

In a text editor, open the YAML file for an existing machine set or create a new one.

Edit the following section under the providerSpec field to provide a valid configuration:


On the Azure portal, review the details for a machine deployed by the machine set and verify that the trusted launch options match the values that you configured.
Configuring Azure confidential virtual machines by using machine sets
Using Azure confidential virtual machines is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
"Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" "4.15" supports Azure confidential virtual machines (VMs).

Confidential VMs are currently not supported on 64-bit ARM architectures.
By editing the machine set YAML file, you can configure the confidential VM options that a machine set uses for machines that it deploys. For example, you can configure these machines to use UEFI security features such as Secure Boot or a dedicated virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) instance.

Not all instance types support confidential VMs. Do not change the instance type for a control plane machine set that is configured to use confidential VMs to a type that is incompatible. Using an incompatible instance type can cause your cluster to become unstable.
For more information about related features and functionality, see the Microsoft Azure documentation about Confidential virtual machines.

In a text editor, open the YAML file for an existing machine set or create a new one.

Edit the following section under the providerSpec field:


On the Azure portal, review the details for a machine deployed by the machine set and verify that the confidential VM options match the values that you configured.
Accelerated Networking for Microsoft Azure VMs
Accelerated Networking uses single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to provide Microsoft Azure VMs with a more direct path to the switch. This enhances network performance. This feature can be enabled after installation.

Limitations
Consider the following limitations when deciding whether to use Accelerated Networking:

Accelerated Networking is only supported on clusters where the Machine API is operational.
Enabling Accelerated Networking on an existing Microsoft Azure cluster
You can enable Accelerated Networking on Azure by adding acceleratedNetworking to your machine set YAML file.

Have an existing Microsoft Azure cluster where the Machine API is operational.


Add the following to the providerSpec field:


On the Microsoft Azure portal, review the Networking settings page for a machine provisioned by the machine set, and verify that the Accelerated networking field is set to Enabled.
