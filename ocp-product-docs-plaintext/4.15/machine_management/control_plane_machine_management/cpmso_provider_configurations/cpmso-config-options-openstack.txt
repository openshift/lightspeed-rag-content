Control plane configuration options for RHOSP

You can change the configuration of your Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) control plane machines and enable features by updating values in the control plane machine set. When you save an update to the control plane machine set, the Control Plane Machine Set Operator updates the control plane machines according to your configured update strategy.
Sample YAML for configuring Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) clusters
The following example YAML snippets show provider specification and failure domain configurations for an RHOSP cluster.

Sample RHOSP provider specification
When you create a control plane machine set for an existing cluster, the provider specification must match the providerSpec configuration in the control plane machine custom resource (CR) that is created by the installation program.

apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1
kind: ControlPlaneMachineSet
metadata:
  name: cluster
  namespace: openshift-machine-api
spec:
# ...
  template:
# ...
      spec:
        providerSpec:
          value:
            apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1alpha1
            cloudName: openstack
            cloudsSecret:
              name: openstack-cloud-credentials 1
              namespace: openshift-machine-api
            flavor: m1.xlarge 2
            image: ocp1-2g2xs-rhcos
            kind: OpenstackProviderSpec 3
            metadata:
              creationTimestamp: null
            networks:
            - filter: {}
              subnets:
              - filter:
                  name: ocp1-2g2xs-nodes
                  tags: openshiftClusterID=ocp1-2g2xs
            securityGroups:
            - filter: {}
              name: ocp1-2g2xs-master 4
            serverGroupName: ocp1-2g2xs-master
            serverMetadata:
              Name: ocp1-2g2xs-master
              openshiftClusterID: ocp1-2g2xs
            tags:
            - openshiftClusterID=ocp1-2g2xs
            trunk: true
            userDataSecret:
              name: master-user-data
The secret name for the cluster. Do not change this value.

The RHOSP flavor type for the control plane.

The RHOSP cloud provider platform type. Do not change this value.

The control plane machines security group.
Sample RHOSP failure domain configuration
The control plane machine set concept of a failure domain is analogous to the existing Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) concept of an availability zone. The ControlPlaneMachineSet CR spreads control plane machines across multiple failure domains when possible.

The following example demonstrates the use of multiple Nova availability zones as well as Cinder availability zones.

apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1
kind: ControlPlaneMachineSet
metadata:
  name: cluster
  namespace: openshift-machine-api
spec:
# ...
  template:
# ...
    machines_v1beta1_machine_openshift_io:
      failureDomains:
        platform: OpenStack
        openstack:
        - availabilityZone: nova-az0
          rootVolume:
            availabilityZone: cinder-az0
        - availabilityZone: nova-az1
          rootVolume:
            availabilityZone: cinder-az1
        - availabilityZone: nova-az2
          rootVolume:
            availabilityZone: cinder-az2
# ...
Enabling Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) features for control plane machines
You can enable the following features by updating values in the control plane machine set.

Changing the RHOSP compute flavor by using a control plane machine set
You can change the Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) compute service (Nova) flavor that your control plane machines use by updating the specification in the control plane machine set custom resource.

In RHOSP, flavors define the compute, memory, and storage capacity of computing instances. By increasing or decreasing the flavor size, you can scale your control plane vertically.

Your RHOSP cluster uses a control plane machine set.


Edit the following line under the providerSpec field:

After you save your changes, machines are replaced with ones that use the flavor you chose.
