Troubleshooting the control plane machine set

Use the information in this section to understand and recover from issues you might encounter.
Checking the control plane machine set custom resource state
You can verify the existence and state of the ControlPlaneMachineSet custom resource (CR).

Determine the state of the CR by running the following command:


To use the control plane machine set, you must ensure that a ControlPlaneMachineSet CR with the correct settings for your cluster exists.

If your cluster has an existing CR, you must verify that the configuration in the CR is correct for your cluster.

If your cluster does not have an existing CR, you must create one with the correct configuration for your cluster.

Creating a control plane machine set custom resource
Adding a missing Azure internal load balancer
The internalLoadBalancer parameter is required in both the ControlPlaneMachineSet and control plane Machine custom resources (CRs) for Azure. If this parameter is not preconfigured on your cluster, you must add it to both CRs.

For more information about where this parameter is located in the Azure provider specification, see the sample Azure provider specification. The placement in the control plane Machine CR is similar.

List the control plane machines in your cluster by running the following command:

For each control plane machine, edit the CR by running the following command:

Add the internalLoadBalancer parameter with the correct details for your cluster and save your changes.

Edit your control plane machine set CR by running the following command:

Add the internalLoadBalancer parameter with the correct details for your cluster and save your changes.


For clusters that use the default RollingUpdate update strategy, the Operator automatically propagates the changes to your control plane configuration.

For clusters that are configured to use the OnDelete update strategy, you must replace your control plane machines manually.


Sample Microsoft Azure provider specification
Recovering a degraded etcd Operator
Certain situations can cause the etcd Operator to become degraded.

For example, while performing remediation, the machine health check might delete a control plane machine that is hosting etcd. If the etcd member is not reachable at that time, the etcd Operator becomes degraded.

When the etcd Operator is degraded, manual intervention is required to force the Operator to remove the failed member and restore the cluster state.

List the control plane machines in your cluster by running the following command:

Edit the machine CR for the failed control plane machine by running the following command:

Remove the contents of the lifecycleHooks parameter from the failed control plane machine and save your changes.


Restoring to a previous cluster state
Upgrading clusters that run on OpenStack
For clusters that run on OpenStack that were created with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.13 or earlier, you might have to perform post-upgrade tasks before you can use control plane machine sets.

Configuring OpenStack clusters that have machines with root volume availability zones after an upgrade
For some clusters that run on OpenStack that you upgrade, you must manually update machine resources before you can use control plane machine sets if the following configurations are true:

The upgraded cluster was created with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.13 or earlier.

The cluster infrastructure is installer-provisioned.

Machines were distributed across multiple availability zones.

Machines were configured to use root volumes for which block storage availability zones were not defined.


To understand why this procedure is necessary, see Solution #7024383.

For all control plane machines, edit the provider spec for all control plane machines that match the environment. For example, to edit the machine master-0, enter the following command:

In the provider spec, set the value of the property rootVolume.availabilityZone to the volume of the availability zone you want to use.

Run the following command to retrieve information about the control plane machine set resource:

Run the following command to edit the resource:

For that resource, set the value of the spec.state property to Active to activate control plane machine sets for your cluster.


Your control plane is ready to be managed by the Cluster Control Plane Machine Set Operator.
Configuring OpenStack clusters that have control plane machines with availability zones after an upgrade
For some clusters that run on OpenStack that you upgrade, you must manually update machine resources before you can use control plane machine sets if the following configurations are true:

The upgraded cluster was created with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.13 or earlier.

The cluster infrastructure is installer-provisioned.

Control plane machines were distributed across multiple compute availability zones.


To understand why this procedure is necessary, see Solution #7013893.

For the master-1 and master-2 control plane machines, open the provider specs for editing. For example, to edit the first machine, enter the following command:

For the master-1 and master-2 control plane machines, edit the value of the serverGroupName property in their provider specs to match that of the machine master-0.

Run the following command to retrieve information about the control plane machine set resource:

Run the following command to edit the resource:

For that resource, set the value of the spec.state property to Active to activate control plane machine sets for your cluster.


Your control plane is ready to be managed by the Cluster Control Plane Machine Set Operator.
