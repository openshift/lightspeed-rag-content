Jaeger configuration reference

When the Service Mesh Operator deploys the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource, it can also create the resources for distributed tracing. Service Mesh uses Jaeger for distributed tracing.

Jaeger does not use FIPS validated cryptographic modules.
Enabling and disabling tracing
You enable distributed tracing by specifying a tracing type and a sampling rate in the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource.

apiVersion: maistra.io/v2
kind: ServiceMeshControlPlane
metadata:
  name: basic
spec:
  version: v2.4
  tracing:
    sampling: 100
    type: Jaeger
Currently, the only tracing type that is supported is Jaeger.

Jaeger is enabled by default. To disable tracing, set type to None.

The sampling rate determines how often the Envoy proxy generates a trace. You can use the sampling rate option to control what percentage of requests get reported to your tracing system. You can configure this setting based upon your traffic in the mesh and the amount of tracing data you want to collect. You configure sampling as a scaled integer representing 0.01% increments. For example, setting the value to 10 samples 0.1% of traces, setting the value to 500 samples 5% of traces, and a setting of 10000 samples 100% of traces.

The SMCP sampling configuration option controls the Envoy sampling rate. You configure the Jaeger trace sampling rate in the Jaeger custom resource.
Specifying Jaeger configuration in the SMCP
You configure Jaeger under the addons section of the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource. However, there are some limitations to what you can configure in the SMCP.

When the SMCP passes configuration information to the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator, it triggers one of three deployment strategies: allInOne, production, or streaming.
Deploying the distributed tracing platform
The distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) has predefined deployment strategies. You specify a deployment strategy in the Jaeger custom resource (CR) file. When you create an instance of the distributed tracing platform (Jaeger), the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator uses this configuration file to create the objects necessary for the deployment.

The Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator currently supports the following deployment strategies:

allInOne (default) - This strategy is intended for development, testing, and demo purposes and it is not for production use. The main back-end components, Agent, Collector, and Query service, are all packaged into a single executable, which is configured (by default) to use in-memory storage. You can configure this deployment strategy in the SMCP.

production - The production strategy is intended for production environments, where long term storage of trace data is important, and a more scalable and highly available architecture is required. Each back-end component is therefore deployed separately. The Agent can be injected as a sidecar on the instrumented application. The Query and Collector services are configured with a supported storage type, which is currently Elasticsearch. Multiple instances of each of these components can be provisioned as required for performance and resilience purposes. You can configure this deployment strategy in the SMCP, but in order to be fully customized, you must specify your configuration in the Jaeger CR and link that to the SMCP.

streaming - The streaming strategy is designed to augment the production strategy by providing a streaming capability that sits between the Collector and the Elasticsearch back-end storage. This provides the benefit of reducing the pressure on the back-end storage, under high load situations, and enables other trace post-processing capabilities to tap into the real-time span data directly from the streaming platform (AMQ Streams/ Kafka). You cannot configure this deployment strategy in the SMCP; you must configure a Jaeger CR and link that to the SMCP.


The streaming strategy requires an additional Red Hat subscription for AMQ Streams.
Default distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) deployment
If you do not specify Jaeger configuration options, the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource will use the allInOne Jaeger deployment strategy by default. When using the default allInOne deployment strategy, set spec.addons.jaeger.install.storage.type to Memory. You can accept the defaults or specify additional configuration options under install.

apiVersion: maistra.io/v2
kind: ServiceMeshControlPlane
metadata:
  name: basic
spec:
  version: v2.4
  tracing:
    sampling: 10000
    type: Jaeger
  addons:
    jaeger:
      name: jaeger
      install:
        storage:
          type: Memory
Production distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) deployment (minimal)
To use the default settings for the production deployment strategy, set spec.addons.jaeger.install.storage.type to Elasticsearch and specify additional configuration options under install. Note that the SMCP only supports configuring Elasticsearch resources and image name.

apiVersion: maistra.io/v2
kind: ServiceMeshControlPlane
metadata:
  name: basic
spec:
  version: v2.4
  tracing:
    sampling: 10000
    type: Jaeger
  addons:
    jaeger:
      name: jaeger  #name of Jaeger CR
      install:
        storage:
          type: Elasticsearch
        ingress:
          enabled: true
  runtime:
    components:
      tracing.jaeger.elasticsearch: # only supports resources and image name
        container:
          resources: {}
Production distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) deployment (fully customized)
The SMCP supports only minimal Elasticsearch parameters. To fully customize your production environment and access all of the Elasticsearch configuration parameters, use the Jaeger custom resource (CR) to configure Jaeger.

Create and configure your Jaeger instance and set spec.addons.jaeger.name to the name of the Jaeger instance, in this example: MyJaegerInstance.

apiVersion: maistra.io/v2
kind: ServiceMeshControlPlane
metadata:
  name: basic
spec:
  version: v2.4
  tracing:
    sampling: 1000
    type: Jaeger
  addons:
    jaeger:
      name: MyJaegerInstance #name of Jaeger CR
      install:
        storage:
          type: Elasticsearch
        ingress:
          enabled: true
Streaming Jaeger deployment
To use the streaming deployment strategy, you create and configure your Jaeger instance first, then set spec.addons.jaeger.name to the name of the Jaeger instance, in this example: MyJaegerInstance.

apiVersion: maistra.io/v2
kind: ServiceMeshControlPlane
metadata:
  name: basic
spec:
  version: v2.4
  tracing:
    sampling: 1000
    type: Jaeger
  addons:
    jaeger:
      name: MyJaegerInstance  #name of Jaeger CR
Specifying Jaeger configuration in a Jaeger custom resource
You can fully customize your Jaeger deployment by configuring Jaeger in the Jaeger custom resource (CR) rather than in the ServiceMeshControlPlane (SMCP) resource. This configuration is sometimes referred to as an "external Jaeger" since the configuration is specified outside of the SMCP.

You must deploy the SMCP and Jaeger CR in the same namespace. For example, istio-system.
You can configure and deploy a standalone Jaeger instance and then specify the name of the Jaeger resource as the value for spec.addons.jaeger.name in the SMCP resource. If a Jaeger CR matching the value of name exists, the Service Mesh control plane will use the existing installation. This approach lets you fully customize your Jaeger configuration.

Deployment best practices
Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform instance names must be unique. If you want to have multiple Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) instances and are using sidecar injected agents, then the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) instances should have unique names, and the injection annotation should explicitly specify the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) instance name the tracing data should be reported to.

If you have a multitenant implementation and tenants are separated by namespaces, deploy a Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) instance to each tenant namespace.
Configuring distributed tracing security for service mesh
The distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) uses OAuth for default authentication. However Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh uses a secret called htpasswd to facilitate communication between dependent services such as Grafana, Kiali, and the distributed tracing platform (Jaeger). When you configure your distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) in the ServiceMeshControlPlane the Service Mesh automatically configures security settings to use htpasswd.

If you are specifying your distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) configuration in a Jaeger custom resource, you must manually configure the htpasswd settings and ensure the htpasswd secret is mounted into your Jaeger instance so that Kiali can communicate with it.

Configuring distributed tracing security for service mesh from the web console
You can modify the Jaeger resource to configure distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) security for use with Service Mesh in the web console.

You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role. If you use Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated, you must have an account with the dedicated-admin role.

The Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator must be installed.

The ServiceMeshControlPlane deployed to the cluster.

You have access to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.


Log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console as a user with the cluster-admin role.

Navigate to Operators -> Installed Operators.

Configuring distributed tracing security for service mesh from the command line
You can modify the Jaeger resource to configure distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) security for use with Service Mesh from the command line by running the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role. If you use Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated, you must have an account with the dedicated-admin role.

Distributed tracing default configuration options
The Jaeger custom resource (CR) defines the architecture and settings to be used when creating the distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) resources. You can modify these parameters to customize your distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) implementation to your business needs.

apiVersion: jaegertracing.io/v1
kind: Jaeger
metadata:
  name: name
spec:
  strategy: <deployment_strategy>
  allInOne:
    options: {}
    resources: {}
  agent:
    options: {}
    resources: {}
  collector:
    options: {}
    resources: {}
  sampling:
    options: {}
  storage:
    type:
    options: {}
  query:
    options: {}
    resources: {}
  ingester:
    options: {}
    resources: {}
  options: {}

The following example YAML is the minimum required to create a Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) deployment using the default settings.

apiVersion: jaegertracing.io/v1
kind: Jaeger
metadata:
  name: jaeger-all-in-one-inmemory
Jaeger Collector configuration options
The Jaeger Collector is the component responsible for receiving the spans that were captured by the tracer and writing them to persistent Elasticsearch storage when using the production strategy, or to AMQ Streams when using the streaming strategy.

The Collectors are stateless and thus many instances of Jaeger Collector can be run in parallel. Collectors require almost no configuration, except for the location of the Elasticsearch cluster.
Distributed tracing sampling configuration options
The Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator can be used to define sampling strategies that will be supplied to tracers that have been configured to use a remote sampler.

While all traces are generated, only a few are sampled. Sampling a trace marks the trace for further processing and storage.

This is not relevant if a trace was started by the Envoy proxy, as the sampling decision is made there. The Jaeger sampling decision is only relevant when the trace is started by an application using the client.
When a service receives a request that contains no trace context, the client starts a new trace, assigns it a random trace ID, and makes a sampling decision based on the currently installed sampling strategy. The sampling decision propagates to all subsequent requests in the trace so that other services are not making the sampling decision again.

distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) libraries support the following samplers:

Probabilistic - The sampler makes a random sampling decision with the probability of sampling equal to the value of the sampling.param property. For example, using sampling.param=0.1 samples approximately 1 in 10 traces.

Rate Limiting - The sampler uses a leaky bucket rate limiter to ensure that traces are sampled with a certain constant rate. For example, using sampling.param=2.0 samples requests with the rate of 2 traces per second.



This example defines a default sampling strategy that is probabilistic, with a 50% chance of the trace instances being sampled.

apiVersion: jaegertracing.io/v1
kind: Jaeger
metadata:
  name: with-sampling
spec:
  sampling:
    options:
      default_strategy:
        type: probabilistic
        param: 0.5
      service_strategies:
        - service: alpha
          type: probabilistic
          param: 0.8
          operation_strategies:
            - operation: op1
              type: probabilistic
              param: 0.2
            - operation: op2
              type: probabilistic
              param: 0.4
        - service: beta
          type: ratelimiting
          param: 5
If there are no user-supplied configurations, the distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) uses the following settings:

spec:
  sampling:
    options:
      default_strategy:
        type: probabilistic
        param: 1
Distributed tracing storage configuration options
You configure storage for the Collector, Ingester, and Query services under spec.storage. Multiple instances of each of these components can be provisioned as required for performance and resilience purposes.



Auto-provisioning an Elasticsearch instance
When you deploy a Jaeger custom resource, the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator uses the Elasticsearch Operator to create an Elasticsearch cluster based on the configuration provided in the storage section of the custom resource file. The Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator will provision Elasticsearch if the following configurations are set:

spec.storage:type is set to elasticsearch

spec.storage.elasticsearch.doNotProvision set to false

spec.storage.options.es.server-urls is not defined, that is, there is no connection to an Elasticsearch instance that was not provisioned by the Elasticsearch Operator.


When provisioning Elasticsearch, the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator sets the Elasticsearch custom resource name to the value of spec.storage.elasticsearch.name from the Jaeger custom resource.  If you do not specify a value for spec.storage.elasticsearch.name, the Operator uses elasticsearch.

You can have only one distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) with self-provisioned Elasticsearch instance per namespace. The Elasticsearch cluster is meant to be dedicated for a single distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) instance.

There can be only one Elasticsearch per namespace.


If you already have installed Elasticsearch as part of OpenShift Logging, the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator can use the installed Elasticsearch Operator to provision storage.
The following configuration parameters are for a self-provisioned Elasticsearch instance, that is an instance created by the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator using the Elasticsearch Operator. You specify configuration options for self-provisioned Elasticsearch under spec:storage:elasticsearch in your configuration file.


Each Elasticsearch node can operate with a lower memory setting though this is NOT recommended for production deployments. For production use, you must have no less than 16 Gi allocated to each pod by default, but preferably allocate as much as you can, up to 64 Gi per pod.

apiVersion: jaegertracing.io/v1
kind: Jaeger
metadata:
  name: simple-prod
spec:
  strategy: production
  storage:
    type: elasticsearch
    elasticsearch:
      nodeCount: 3
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 1
          memory: 16Gi
        limits:
          memory: 16Gi
apiVersion: jaegertracing.io/v1
kind: Jaeger
metadata:
  name: simple-prod
spec:
  strategy: production

        storageClassName: gp2
        size: 5Gi
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 200m
          memory: 4Gi
        limits:
          memory: 4Gi
      redundancyPolicy: ZeroRedundancy
Persistent storage configuration. In this case AWS gp2 with 5Gi size. When no value is specified, distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) uses emptyDir. The Elasticsearch Operator provisions PersistentVolumeClaim and PersistentVolume which are not removed with distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) instance. You can mount the same volumes if you create a distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) instance with the same name and namespace.
Connecting to an existing Elasticsearch instance
You can use an existing Elasticsearch cluster for storage with distributed tracing platform. An existing Elasticsearch cluster, also known as an external Elasticsearch instance, is an instance that was not installed by the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator or by the Elasticsearch Operator.

When you deploy a Jaeger custom resource, the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator will not provision Elasticsearch if the following configurations are set:

spec.storage.elasticsearch.doNotProvision set to true

spec.storage.options.es.server-urls has a value

spec.storage.elasticsearch.name has a value, or if the Elasticsearch instance name is elasticsearch.


The Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator uses the Elasticsearch instance specified in spec.storage.elasticsearch.name to connect to Elasticsearch.

You cannot share or reuse a Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform logging Elasticsearch instance with distributed tracing platform (Jaeger). The Elasticsearch cluster is meant to be dedicated for a single distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) instance.


The following configuration parameters are for an already existing Elasticsearch instance, also known as an external Elasticsearch instance. In this case, you specify configuration options for Elasticsearch under spec:storage:options:es in your custom resource file.







apiVersion: jaegertracing.io/v1
kind: Jaeger
metadata:
  name: simple-prod
spec:
  strategy: production
  storage:
    type: elasticsearch
    options:
      es:
        server-urls: https://quickstart-es-http.default.svc:9200
        index-prefix: my-prefix
        tls:
          ca: /es/certificates/ca.crt
    secretName: tracing-secret
  volumeMounts:
    - name: certificates
      mountPath: /es/certificates/
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
    - name: certificates
      secret:
        secretName: quickstart-es-http-certs-public
The following example shows a Jaeger CR using an external Elasticsearch cluster with TLS CA certificate mounted from a volume and user/password stored in a secret.

apiVersion: jaegertracing.io/v1
kind: Jaeger
metadata:
  name: simple-prod
spec:
  strategy: production
  storage:
    type: elasticsearch
    options:
      es:
        server-urls: https://quickstart-es-http.default.svc:9200 1
        index-prefix: my-prefix
        tls: 2
          ca: /es/certificates/ca.crt
    secretName: tracing-secret 3
  volumeMounts: 4
    - name: certificates
      mountPath: /es/certificates/
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
    - name: certificates
      secret:
        secretName: quickstart-es-http-certs-public
URL to Elasticsearch service running in default namespace.

TLS configuration. In this case only CA certificate, but it can also contain es.tls.key and es.tls.cert when using mutual TLS.

Secret which defines environment variables ES_PASSWORD and ES_USERNAME. Created by kubectl create secret generic tracing-secret --from-literal=ES_PASSWORD=changeme --from-literal=ES_USERNAME=elastic

Volume mounts and volumes which are mounted into all storage components.
Managing certificates with Elasticsearch
You can create and manage certificates using the Elasticsearch Operator. Managing certificates using the Elasticsearch Operator also lets you use a single Elasticsearch cluster with multiple Jaeger Collectors.

Managing certificates with Elasticsearch is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
Starting with version 2.4, the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator delegates certificate creation to the Elasticsearch Operator by using the following annotations in the Elasticsearch custom resource:

logging.openshift.io/elasticsearch-cert-management: "true"

logging.openshift.io/elasticsearch-cert.jaeger-<shared-es-node-name>: "user.jaeger"

logging.openshift.io/elasticsearch-cert.curator-<shared-es-node-name>: "system.logging.curator"


Where the <shared-es-node-name> is the name of the Elasticsearch node. For example, if you create an Elasticsearch node named custom-es, your custom resource might look like the following example.

apiVersion: logging.openshift.io/v1
kind: Elasticsearch
metadata:
  annotations:
    logging.openshift.io/elasticsearch-cert-management: "true"
    logging.openshift.io/elasticsearch-cert.jaeger-custom-es: "user.jaeger"
    logging.openshift.io/elasticsearch-cert.curator-custom-es: "system.logging.curator"
  name: custom-es
spec:
  managementState: Managed
  nodeSpec:
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: 16Gi
      requests:
        cpu: 1
        memory: 16Gi
  nodes:
    - nodeCount: 3
      proxyResources: {}
      resources: {}
      roles:
        - master
        - client
        - data
      storage: {}
  redundancyPolicy: ZeroRedundancy
The Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator is installed.

The logging subsystem for Red Hat OpenShift is installed with default configuration in your cluster.

The Elasticsearch node and the Jaeger instances must be deployed in the same namespace. For example, tracing-system.


You enable certificate management by setting spec.storage.elasticsearch.useCertManagement to true in the Jaeger custom resource.

apiVersion: jaegertracing.io/v1
kind: Jaeger
metadata:
  name: jaeger-prod
spec:
  strategy: production
  storage:
    type: elasticsearch
    elasticsearch:
      name: custom-es
      doNotProvision: true
      useCertManagement: true
The Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator sets the Elasticsearch custom resource name to the value of spec.storage.elasticsearch.name from the Jaeger custom resource when provisioning Elasticsearch.

The certificates are provisioned by the Elasticsearch Operator and the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator injects the certificates.
Query configuration options
Query is a service that retrieves traces from storage and hosts the user interface to display them.
