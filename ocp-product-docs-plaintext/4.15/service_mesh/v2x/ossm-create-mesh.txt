Adding services to a service mesh

A project contains services; however, the services are only available if you add the project to the service mesh.
About adding projects to a service mesh
After installing the Operators and creating the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource, add one or more projects to the service mesh.

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, a project is essentially a Kubernetes namespace with additional annotations, such as the range of user IDs that can be used in the project. Typically, the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console uses the term project, and the CLI uses the term namespace, but the terms are essentially synonymous.
You can add projects to an existing service mesh using either the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console or the CLI. There are three methods to add a project to a service mesh:

Specifying the project name in the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource.

Configuring label selectors in the spec.labelSelectors field of the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource.

Creating the ServiceMeshMember resource in the project.


If you use the first method, then you must create the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource.
Creating the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh member roll
The ServiceMeshMemberRoll lists the projects that belong to the Service Mesh control plane. Only projects listed in the ServiceMeshMemberRoll are affected by the control plane. A project does not belong to a service mesh until you add it to the member roll for a particular control plane deployment.

You must create a ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource named default in the same project as the ServiceMeshControlPlane, for example istio-system.

Creating the member roll from the web console
You can add one or more projects to the Service Mesh member roll from the web console. In this example, istio-system is the name of the Service Mesh control plane project.

Log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

If you do not already have services for your mesh, or you are starting from scratch, create a project for your applications. It must be different from the project where you installed the Service Mesh control plane.

Navigate to Operators -> Installed Operators.

Click the Project menu and choose the project where your ServiceMeshControlPlane resource is deployed from the list, for example istio-system.

Click the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator.

Click the Istio Service Mesh Member Roll tab.

Click Create ServiceMeshMemberRoll

Click Members, then enter the name of your project in the Value field. You can add any number of projects, but a project can only belong to one ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource.

Click Create.
Creating the member roll from the CLI
You can add a project to the ServiceMeshMemberRoll from the command line.

Log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI.

If you do not already have services for your mesh, or you are starting from scratch, create a project for your applications. It must be different from the project where you installed the Service Mesh control plane.

To add your projects as members, modify the following example YAML. You can add any number of projects, but a project can only belong to one ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource. In this example, istio-system is the name of the Service Mesh control plane project.

Run the following command to upload and create the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource in the istio-system namespace.

Run the following command to verify the ServiceMeshMemberRoll was created successfully.
About adding projects using the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource
Using the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource is the simplest way to add a project to a service mesh. To add a project, specify the project name in the spec.members field of the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource. The ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource specifies which projects are controlled by the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource.


Adding projects using this method requires the user to have the update servicemeshmemberrolls and the update pods privileges in the project that is being added.
If you already have an application, workload, or service to add to the service mesh, see the following:

Alternatively, to install a sample application called Bookinfo and add it to a ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource, see the Bookinfo example application tutorial.


Adding or removing projects from the mesh using the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource with the web console
You can add or remove projects from the mesh using the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource with the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console. You can add any number of projects, but a project can only belong to one mesh.

About adding projects using the ServiceMeshMember resource
A ServiceMeshMember resource provides a way to add a project to a service mesh without modifying the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource. To add a project, create a ServiceMeshMember resource in the project that you want to add to the service mesh. When the Service Mesh Operator processes the ServiceMeshMember object, the project appears in the status.members list of the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource. Then, the services that reside in the project are made available to the mesh.


The mesh administrator must grant each mesh user permission to reference the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource in the ServiceMeshMember resource. With this permission in place, a mesh user can add a project to a mesh even when that user does not have direct access rights for the service mesh project or the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource. For more information, see Creating the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh members.

Adding a project to the mesh using the ServiceMeshMember resource with the web console
You can add one or more projects to the mesh using the ServiceMeshMember resource with the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

You have installed the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator.

You know the name of the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource and the name of the project that the resource belongs to.

You know the name of the project you want to add to the mesh.

A service mesh administrator must explicitly grant access to the service mesh. Administrators can grant users permissions to access the mesh by assigning them the mesh-user Role using a RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding. For more information, see Creating the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh members.


Log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

Navigate to Operators -> Installed Operators.

Click the Project menu and choose the project that you want to add to the mesh from the drop-down list. For example, istio-system.

Click the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator.

Click the Istio Service Mesh Member tab.

Click Create ServiceMeshMember

Accept the default name for the ServiceMeshMember.

Click to expand ControlPlaneRef.

In the Namespace field, select the project that the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource belongs to. For example, istio-system.

In the Name field, enter the name of the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource that this namespace belongs to. For example, basic.

Click Create.


Confirm the ServiceMeshMember resource was created and that the project was added to the mesh by using the following steps:
Adding a project to the mesh using the ServiceMeshMember resource with the CLI

You have installed the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator.

You know the name of the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource and the name of the project it belongs to.

You know the name of the project you want to add to the mesh.

A service mesh administrator must explicitly grant access to the service mesh. Administrators can grant users permissions to access the mesh by assigning them the mesh-user Role using a RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding. For more information, see Creating the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh members.


Log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI.

Create the YAML file for the ServiceMeshMember manifest. The manifest adds the my-application project to the service mesh that was created by the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource deployed in the istio-system namespace:

Apply the YAML file to create the ServiceMeshMember resource:


Verify that the namespace is part of the mesh by running the following command. Confirm the that the value True appears in the READY column.

Alternatively, view the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource to confirm that the my-application namespace is displayed in the status.members and status.configuredMembers fields of the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource.
About adding projects using label selectors
For cluster-wide deployments, you can use label selectors to add projects to the mesh. Label selectors specified in the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource enable the Service Mesh Operator to add or remove namespaces to or from the mesh based on namespace labels. Unlike other standard Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform resources that you can use to specify a single label selector, you can use the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource to specify multiple label selectors.


If the labels for a namespace match any of the selectors specified in the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource, then the namespace is included in the mesh.

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, a project is essentially a Kubernetes namespace with additional annotations, such as the range of user IDs that can be used in the project. Typically, the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console uses the term project, and the CLI uses the term namespace, but the terms are essentially synonymous.

Bookinfo example application
The Bookinfo example application allows you to test your Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh 2.4.4 installation on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

The Bookinfo application displays information about a book, similar to a single catalog entry of an online book store. The application displays a page that describes the book, book details (ISBN, number of pages, and other information), and book reviews.

The Bookinfo application consists of these microservices:

The productpage microservice calls the details and reviews microservices to populate the page.

The details microservice contains book information.

The reviews microservice contains book reviews. It also calls the ratings microservice.

The ratings microservice contains book ranking information that accompanies a book review.


There are three versions of the reviews microservice:

Version v1 does not call the ratings Service.

Version v2 calls the ratings Service and displays each rating as one to five black stars.

Version v3 calls the ratings Service and displays each rating as one to five red stars.
