Installing the Operators

To install Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh, first install the required Operators on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and then create a ServiceMeshControlPlane resource to deploy the control plane.

This basic installation is configured based on the default OpenShift settings and is not designed for production use.Â  Use this default installation to verify your installation, and then configure your service mesh for your specific environment.
Read the Preparing to install Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh process.

An account with the cluster-admin role. If you use Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated, you must have an account with the dedicated-admin role.


The following steps show how to install a basic instance of Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
Operator overview
Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh requires the following Operators:

OpenShift Elasticsearch - (Optional) Provides database storage for tracing and logging with the distributed tracing platform (Jaeger). It is based on the open source Elasticsearch project.

Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) - Provides distributed tracing to monitor and troubleshoot transactions in complex distributed systems. It is based on the open source Jaeger project.

Kiali Operator (provided by Red Hat) - Provides observability for your service mesh. You can view configurations, monitor traffic, and analyze traces in a single console. It is based on the open source Kiali project.

Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh - Allows you to connect, secure, control, and observe the microservices that comprise your applications. The Service Mesh Operator defines and monitors the ServiceMeshControlPlane resources that manage the deployment, updating, and deletion of the Service Mesh components. It is based on the open source Istio project.


Do not install Community versions of the Operators. Community Operators are not supported.
Installing the Operators
To install Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh, install the following Operators in this order. Repeat the procedure for each Operator.

OpenShift Elasticsearch

Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger)

Kiali Operator provided by Red Hat

Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh


If you have already installed the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator as part of OpenShift Logging, you do not need to install the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator again. The Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator will create the Elasticsearch instance using the installed OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator.
Log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console as a user with the cluster-admin role.

In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, click Operators -> OperatorHub.

Type the name of the Operator into the filter box and select the Red Hat version of the Operator. Community versions of the Operators are not supported.

Click Install.

On the Install Operator page for each Operator, accept  the default settings.

Click Install. Wait until the Operator has installed before repeating the steps for the next Operator in the list.


After all you have installed all four Operators, click Operators -> Installed Operators to verify that your Operators are installed.
Configuring the Service Mesh Operator to run on infrastructure nodes
This task should only be performed if the Service Mesh Operator runs on an infrastructure node.

If the operator will run on a worker node, skip this task.

The Service Mesh Operator must be installed.

One of the nodes comprising the deployment must be an infrastructure node. For more information, see "Creating infrastructure machine sets."


List the operators installed in the namespace:

Edit the Service Mesh Operator Subscription resource to specify where the operator should run:

Add the nodeSelector and tolerations to spec.config in the Subscription resource:
Verifying the Service Mesh Operator is running on infrastructure node
Verify that the node associated with the Operator pod is an infrastructure node:
Next steps
The Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator does not create the Service Mesh custom resource definitions (CRDs) until you deploy a Service Mesh control plane. You can use the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource to install and configure the Service Mesh components. For more information, see Creating the ServiceMeshControlPlane.
