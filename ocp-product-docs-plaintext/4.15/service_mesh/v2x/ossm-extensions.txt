Extensions

You can use WebAssembly extensions to add new features directly into the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh proxies. This lets you move even more common functionality out of your applications, and implement them in a single language that compiles to WebAssembly bytecode.

WebAssembly extensions are not supported on IBM Z&#174; and IBM Power&#174;.
WebAssembly modules overview
WebAssembly modules can be run on many platforms, including proxies, and have broad language support, fast execution, and a sandboxed-by-default security model.

Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh extensions are Envoy HTTP Filters, giving them a wide range of capabilities:

Manipulating the body and headers of requests and responses.

Out-of-band HTTP requests to services not in the request path, such as authentication or policy checking.

Side-channel data storage and queues for filters to communicate with each other.


When creating new WebAssembly extensions, use the WasmPlugin API. The ServiceMeshExtension API was deprecated in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh version 2.2 and was removed in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh version 2.3.
There are two parts to writing a Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh extension:

You must write your extension using an SDK that exposes the proxy-wasm API and compile it to a WebAssembly module.

You must then package the module into a container.


You can use any language that compiles to WebAssembly bytecode to write a Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh extension, but the following languages have existing SDKs that expose the proxy-wasm API so that it can be consumed directly.
WasmPlugin container format
Istio supports Open Container Initiative (OCI) images in its Wasm Plugin mechanism. You can distribute your Wasm Plugins as a container image, and you can use the spec.url field to refer to a container registry location.  For example, quay.io/my-username/my-plugin:latest.

Because each execution environment (runtime) for a WASM module can have runtime-specific configuration parameters, a WASM image can be composed of two layers:

plugin.wasm (Required) - Content layer. This layer consists of a .wasm binary containing the bytecode of your WebAssembly module, to be loaded by the runtime.  You must name this file plugin.wasm.

runtime-config.json (Optional) - Configuration layer. This layer consists of a JSON-formatted string that describes metadata about the module for the target runtime. The config layer might also contain additional data, depending on the target runtime. For example, the config for a WASM Envoy Filter contains root_ids available on the filter.
WasmPlugin API reference
The WasmPlugins API provides a mechanism to extend the functionality provided by the Istio proxy through WebAssembly filters.

You can deploy multiple WasmPlugins. The phase and priority settings determine the order of execution (as part of Envoy's filter chain), allowing the configuration of complex interactions between user-supplied WasmPlugins and Istio’s internal filters.

In the following example, an authentication filter implements an OpenID flow and populates the Authorization header with a JSON Web Token (JWT). Istio authentication consumes this token and deploys it to the ingress gateway. The WasmPlugin file lives in the proxy sidecar filesystem. Note the field url.

apiVersion: extensions.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: WasmPlugin
metadata:
  name: openid-connect
  namespace: istio-ingress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      istio: ingressgateway
  url: file:///opt/filters/openid.wasm
  sha256: 1ef0c9a92b0420cf25f7fe5d481b231464bc88f486ca3b9c83ed5cc21d2f6210
  phase: AUTHN
  pluginConfig:
    openid_server: authn
    openid_realm: ingress
Below is the same example, but this time an Open Container Initiative (OCI) image is used instead of a file in the filesystem. Note the fields url, imagePullPolicy, and imagePullSecret.

apiVersion: extensions.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: WasmPlugin
metadata:
  name: openid-connect
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      istio: ingressgateway
  url: oci://private-registry:5000/openid-connect/openid:latest
  imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  imagePullSecret: private-registry-pull-secret
  phase: AUTHN
  pluginConfig:
    openid_server: authn
    openid_realm: ingress

The WorkloadSelector object specifies the criteria used to determine if a filter can be applied to a proxy. The matching criteria includes the metadata associated with a proxy, workload instance information such as labels attached to the pod/VM, or any other information that the proxy provides to Istio during the initial handshake. If multiple conditions are specified, all conditions need to match in order for the workload instance to be selected. Currently, only label based selection mechanism is supported.


The PullPolicy object specifies the pull behavior to be applied when fetching an OCI image.


Struct represents a structured data value, consisting of fields which map to dynamically typed values. In some languages, Struct might be supported by a native representation. For example, in scripting languages like JavaScript a struct is represented as an object.


PluginPhase specifies the phase in the filter chain where the plugin will be injected.


Deploying WasmPlugin resources
You can enable Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh extensions using the WasmPlugin resource. In this example, istio-system is the name of the Service Mesh control plane project. The following example creates an openid-connect filter that performs an OpenID Connect flow to authenticate the user.

Create the following example resource:

Apply your plugin.yaml file with the following command:
ServiceMeshExtension container format
You must have a .wasm file containing the bytecode of your WebAssembly module, and a manifest.yaml file in the root of the container filesystem to make your container image a valid extension image.

When creating new WebAssembly extensions, use the WasmPlugin API. The ServiceMeshExtension API was deprecated in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh version 2.2 and was removed in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh version 2.3.
schemaVersion: 1

name: <your-extension>
description: <description>
version: 1.0.0
phase: PreAuthZ
priority: 100
module: extension.wasm
ServiceMeshExtension reference
The ServiceMeshExtension API provides a mechanism to extend the functionality provided by the Istio proxy through WebAssembly filters. There are two parts to writing a WebAssembly extension:

Write your extension using an SDK that exposes the proxy-wasm API and compile it to a WebAssembly module.

Package it into a container.


When creating new WebAssembly extensions, use the WasmPlugin API. The ServiceMeshExtension API, which was deprecated in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh version 2.2, was removed in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh version 2.3.

Deploying ServiceMeshExtension resources
You can enable Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh extensions using the ServiceMeshExtension resource. In this example, istio-system is the name of the Service Mesh control plane project.

When creating new WebAssembly extensions, use the WasmPlugin API. The ServiceMeshExtension API was deprecated in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh version 2.2 and removed in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh version 2.3.
For a complete example that was built using the Rust SDK, take a look at the header-append-filter. It is a simple filter that appends one or more headers to the HTTP responses, with their names and values taken out from the config field of the extension. See a sample configuration in the snippet below.

Create the following example resource:

Apply your extension.yaml file with the following command:
Migrating from ServiceMeshExtension to WasmPlugin resources
The ServiceMeshExtension API, which was deprecated in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh version 2.2, was removed in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh version 2.3. If you are using the ServiceMeshExtension API, you must migrate to the WasmPlugin API to continue using your WebAssembly extensions.

The APIs are very similar. The migration consists of two steps:

Renaming your plugin file and updating the module packaging.

Creating a WasmPlugin resource that references the updated container image.


API changes
The new WasmPlugin API is similar to the ServiceMeshExtension, but with a few differences, especially in the field names:


The following is an example of how a ServiceMeshExtension resource could be converted into a WasmPlugin resource.

apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
kind: ServiceMeshExtension
metadata:
  name: header-append
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  workloadSelector:
    labels:
      app: httpbin
  config:
    first-header: some-value
    another-header: another-value
  image: quay.io/maistra-dev/header-append-filter:2.2
  phase: PostAuthZ
  priority: 100
apiVersion: extensions.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: WasmPlugin
metadata:
  name: header-append
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: httpbin
  url: oci://quay.io/maistra-dev/header-append-filter:2.2
  phase: STATS
  pluginConfig:
    first-header: some-value
    another-header: another-value
Container image format changes
The new WasmPlugin container image format is similar to the ServiceMeshExtensions, with the following differences:

The ServiceMeshExtension container format required a metadata file named manifest.yaml in the root directory of the container filesystem. The WasmPlugin container format does not require a manifest.yaml file.

The .wasm file (the actual plugin) that previously could have any filename now must be named plugin.wasm and must be located in the root directory of the container filesystem.
Migrating to WasmPlugin resources
To upgrade your WebAssembly extensions from the ServiceMeshExtension API to the WasmPlugin API, you rename your plugin file.

ServiceMeshControlPlane is upgraded to version 2.2 or later.


Update your container image. If the plugin is already in /plugin.wasm inside the container, skip to the next step.  If not:

Remove the ServiceMeshExtension resource and create a WasmPlugin resource that refers to the new container image you built.
