Creating the ServiceMeshControlPlane

About ServiceMeshControlPlane
The control plane includes Istiod, Ingress and Egress Gateways, and other components, such as Kiali and Jaeger. The control plane must be deployed in a separate namespace than the Service Mesh Operators and the data plane applications and services. You can deploy a basic installation of the ServiceMeshControlPlane(SMCP) from the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" web console or the command line using the oc client tool.

This basic installation is configured based on the default "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" settings and is not designed for production use. Use this default installation to verify your installation, and then configure your ServiceMeshControlPlane settings for your environment.
The Service Mesh documentation uses istio-system as the example project, but you can deploy the service mesh to any project.
Deploying the Service Mesh control plane from the web console
You can deploy a basic ServiceMeshControlPlane by using the web console.  In this example, istio-system is the name of the Service Mesh control plane project.

About control plane components and infrastructure nodes
Infrastructure nodes provide a way to isolate infrastructure workloads for two primary purposes:

To prevent incurring billing costs against subscription counts

To separate maintenance and management of infrastructure workloads


You can configure some or all of the Service Mesh control plane components to run on infrastructure nodes.

Configuring all control plane components to run on infrastructure nodes using the web console
Perform this task if all of the components deployed by the Service Mesh control plane will run on infrastructure nodes. These deployed components include Istiod, Ingress Gateway, and Egress Gateway, and optional applications such as Prometheus, Grafana, and Distributed Tracing.

If the control plane will run on a worker node, skip this task.

About control plane and cluster-wide deployments
A cluster-wide deployment contains a Service Mesh Control Plane that monitors resources for an entire cluster. Monitoring resources for an entire cluster closely resembles Istio functionality in that the control plane uses a single query across all namespaces to monitor Istio and Kubernetes resources. As a result, cluster-wide deployments decrease the number of requests sent to the API server.

You can configure the Service Mesh Control Plane for cluster-wide deployments using either the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" web console or the CLI.

Configuring the control plane for cluster-wide deployment with the web console
You can configure the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource for cluster-wide deployment using the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" web console. In this example, istio-system is the name of the Service Mesh control plane project.

The Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator is installed.

You are logged in to "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" as`cluster-admin`.


Create a project named istio-system.

Navigate to Operators -> Installed Operators.

Click the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator, then click Istio Service Mesh Control Plane.

On the Istio Service Mesh Control Plane tab, click Create ServiceMeshControlPlane.

Click YAML view. The version of the Service Mesh control plane determines the features available regardless of the version of the Operator.

Modify the spec.mode field of the YAML file to specify ClusterWide.

Click Create. The Operator creates pods, services, and Service Mesh control plane components based on your configuration parameters. The operator also creates the ServiceMeshMemberRoll if it does not exist as part of the default configuration.


To verify that the control plane installed correctly:
Configuring the control plane for cluster-wide deployment with the CLI
You can configure the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource for cluster-wide deployment using the CLI. In this example, istio-system is the name of the Service Mesh control plane namespace.

The Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator is installed.

You have access to the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You are logged in to "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" as`cluster-admin`.


Create a project named istio-system.

Create a ServiceMeshControlPlane file named istio-installation.yaml using the following example:

Run the following command to deploy the Service Mesh control plane:


To monitor the progress of the pod deployment, run the following command:
Customizing the member roll for a cluster-wide mesh
In cluster-wide mode, when you create the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource, the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource is also created. You can modify the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource after it gets created. After you modify the resource, the Service Mesh operator no longer changes it. If you modify the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource by using the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" web console, accept the prompt to overwrite the modifications.

Alternatively, you can create a ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource before deploying the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource. When you create the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource, the Service Mesh Operator will not modify the ServiceMeshMemberRoll.

The ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource name must be named default and must be created in the same project namespace as the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource.
There are two ways to add a namespace to the mesh. You can either add the namespace by specifying its name in the spec.members list, or configure a set of namespace label selectors to include or exclude namespaces based on their labels.

Regardless of how members are specified in the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource, you can also add members to the mesh by creating the ServiceMeshMember resource in each namespace.
Validating your SMCP installation with Kiali
You can use the Kiali console to validate your Service Mesh installation. The Kiali console offers several ways to validate your Service Mesh components are deployed and configured properly.
