Installing Service Mesh

You are viewing documentation for a Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh release that is no longer supported.

Service Mesh version 1.0 and 1.1 control planes are no longer supported. For information about upgrading your service mesh control plane, see Upgrading Service Mesh.

For information about the support status of a particular Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh release, see the Product lifecycle page.
Installing the Service Mesh involves installing the OpenShift Elasticsearch, Jaeger, Kiali and Service Mesh Operators, creating and managing a ServiceMeshControlPlane resource to deploy the control plane, and creating a ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource to specify the namespaces associated with the Service Mesh.

Mixer's policy enforcement is disabled by default. You must enable it to run policy tasks. See Update Mixer policy enforcement for instructions on enabling Mixer policy enforcement.
Multi-tenant control plane installations are the default configuration.
The Service Mesh documentation uses istio-system as the example project, but you can deploy the service mesh to any project.
Prerequisites
Follow the Preparing to install Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh process.

An account with the cluster-admin role.


The Service Mesh installation process uses the OperatorHub to install the ServiceMeshControlPlane custom resource definition within the openshift-operators project. The Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh defines and monitors the ServiceMeshControlPlane related to the deployment, update, and deletion of the control plane.

Starting with Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh 1.1.18.2, you must install the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator, the Jaeger Operator, and the Kiali Operator before the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator can install the control plane.
Installing the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator
The default Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) deployment uses in-memory storage because it is designed to be installed quickly for those evaluating Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform, giving demonstrations, or using Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) in a test environment. If you plan to use Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) in production, you must install and configure a persistent storage option, in this case, Elasticsearch.

You have access to the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" web console.

You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role. If you use Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated, you must have an account with the dedicated-admin role.


Do not install Community versions of the Operators. Community Operators are not supported.
If you have already installed the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator as part of OpenShift Logging, you do not need to install the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator again. The Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator creates the Elasticsearch instance using the installed OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator.
Log in to the "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform" web console as a user with the cluster-admin role. If you use Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated, you must have an account with the dedicated-admin role.

Navigate to Operators -> OperatorHub.

Type Elasticsearch into the filter box to locate the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator.

Click the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator provided by Red Hat to display information about the Operator.

Click Install.

On the Install Operator page, select the stable Update Channel. This automatically updates your Operator as new versions are released.

Accept the default All namespaces on the cluster (default). This installs the Operator in the default openshift-operators-redhat project and makes the Operator available to all projects in the cluster.

Accept the default Automatic approval strategy. By accepting the default, when a new version of this Operator is available, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically upgrades the running instance of your Operator without human intervention. If you select Manual updates, when a newer version of an Operator is available, OLM creates an update request. As a cluster administrator, you must then manually approve that update request to have the Operator updated to the new version.

Click Install.

On the Installed Operators page, select the openshift-operators-redhat project. Wait for the InstallSucceeded status of the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator before continuing.

Manual updates
If you choose to update manually, the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) controls the installation, upgrade, and role-based access control (RBAC) of Operators in a cluster. OLM runs by default in "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform". OLM uses CatalogSources, which use the Operator Registry API, to query for available Operators as well as upgrades for installed Operators.

Updating sidecar proxies
In order to update the configuration for sidecar proxies the application administrator must restart the application pods.

If your deployment uses automatic sidecar injection, you can update the pod template in the deployment by adding or modifying an annotation. Run the following command to redeploy the pods:

$ oc patch deployment/<deployment> -p '{"spec":{"template":{"metadata":{"annotations":{"kubectl.kubernetes.io/restartedAt": "'`date -Iseconds`'"}}}}}'
If your deployment does not use automatic sidecar injection, you must manually update the sidecars by modifying the sidecar container image specified in the deployment or pod, and then restart the pods.
