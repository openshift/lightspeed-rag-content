Getting started with hosted control planes

To get started with hosted control planes for "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform", you first configure your hosted cluster on the provider that you want to use. Then, you complete a few management tasks.

You can view the procedures by selecting from one of the following providers:
Bare metal
Hosted control plane sizing guidance

Installing the hosted control plane command line interface

Distributing hosted cluster workloads

Bare metal firewall and port requirements

Bare metal infrastructure requirements: Review the infrastructure requirements to create a hosted cluster on bare metal.

Configuring hosted control plane clusters on bare metal:

Configuring hosted control planes in a disconnected environment

To destroy a hosted cluster on bare metal, follow the instructions in Destroying a hosted cluster on bare metal.

Amazon Web Services (AWS)
Hosted control planes on the AWS platform is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
AWS infrastructure requirements: Review the infrastructure requirements to create a hosted cluster on AWS.

Configuring hosted control plane clusters on AWS (Technology Preview): The tasks to configure hosted control plane clusters on AWS include creating the AWS S3 OIDC secret, creating a routable public zone, enabling external DNS, enabling AWS PrivateLink, and deploying a hosted cluster.

Deploying the SR-IOV Operator for hosted control planes: After you configure and deploy your hosting service cluster, you can create a subscription to the Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) Operator on a hosted cluster. The SR-IOV pod runs on worker machines rather than the control plane.

To destroy a hosted cluster on AWS, follow the instructions in Destroying a hosted cluster on AWS.
