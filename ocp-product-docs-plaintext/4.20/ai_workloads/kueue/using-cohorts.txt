# Using cohorts


You can use cohorts to group cluster queues and determine which cluster queues are able to share borrowable resources with each other.
Borrowable resources are defined as the unused nominal quota of all the cluster queues in a cohort.
Using cohorts can help to optimize resource utilization by preventing under-utilization and enabling fair sharing configurations.
Cohorts can also help to simplify resource management and allocation between teams, because you can group cluster queues for related workloads or for each team.
You can also use cohorts to set resource quotas at a group level to define the limits for resources that a group of cluster queues can consume.

# Configuring cohorts within a cluster queue spec

You can add a cluster queue to a cohort by specifying the name of the cohort in the .spec.cohort field of the ClusterQueue object, as shown in the following example:


```yaml
apiVersion: kueue.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterQueue
metadata:
  name: cluster-queue
spec:
# ...
  cohort: example-cohort
# ...
```


All cluster queues that have a matching spec.cohort are part of the same cohort.

If the spec.cohort field is omitted, the cluster queue does not belong to any cohort and cannot access borrowable resources.
