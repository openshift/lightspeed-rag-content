# About Google authentication

Using Google as an identity provider allows any Google user to authenticate to your server. You can limit authentication to members of a specific hosted domain with the hostedDomain configuration attribute.


[NOTE]
----
Using Google as an identity provider requires users to get a token using <namespace_route>/oauth/token/request to use with command-line tools.
