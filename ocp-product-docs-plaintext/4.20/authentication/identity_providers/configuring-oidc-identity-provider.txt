Claims are read from the JWT id_token returned from the OpenID identity provider and, if specified, from the JSON returned by the UserInfo URL.

At least one claim must be configured to use as the user&#8217;s identity. The standard identity claim is sub.

You can also indicate which claims to use as the user&#8217;s preferred user name, display name, and email address. If multiple claims are specified, the first one with a non-empty value is used. The following table lists the standard claims:



See the OpenID claims documentation for more information.


[NOTE]
----
Unless your OpenID Connect identity provider supports the resource owner password credentials (ROPC) grant flow, users must get a token from <namespace_route>/oauth/token/request to use with command-line tools.
