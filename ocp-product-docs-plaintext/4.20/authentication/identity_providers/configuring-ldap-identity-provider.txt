# Configuring an LDAP identity provider


Configure the ldap identity provider to validate user names and passwords against an LDAPv3 server, using simple bind authentication.

# About LDAP authentication

During authentication, the LDAP directory is searched for an entry that matches
the provided user name. If a single unique match is found, a simple bind is
attempted using the distinguished name (DN) of the entry plus the provided
password.

These are the steps taken:

1. Generate a search filter by combining the attribute and filter in the
configured url with the user-provided user name.
2. Search the directory using the generated filter. If the search does not return
exactly one entry, deny access.
3. Attempt to bind to the LDAP server using the DN of the entry retrieved from
the search, and the user-provided password.
4. If the bind is unsuccessful, deny access.
5. If the bind is successful, build an identity using the configured attributes
as the identity, email address, display name, and preferred user name.

The configured url is an RFC 2255 URL, which specifies the LDAP host and
search parameters to use. The syntax of the URL is:


```
ldap://host:port/basedn?attribute?scope?filter
```


For this URL:



When doing searches, the attribute, filter, and provided user name are combined
to create a search filter that looks like:


```
(&(<filter>)(<attribute>=<username>))
```


For example, consider a URL of:


```
ldap://ldap.example.com/o=Acme?cn?sub?(enabled=true)
```


When a client attempts to connect using a user name of bob, the resulting
search filter will be (&(enabled=true)(cn=bob)).

If the LDAP directory requires authentication to search, specify a bindDN and
bindPassword to use to perform the entry search.
