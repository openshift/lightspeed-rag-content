# Using service accounts in applications



# Service accounts overview

A service account is an {product-title} account that allows a component to
directly access the API. Service accounts are API objects that exist within each project.
Service accounts provide a flexible way to control API
access without sharing a regular user&#8217;s credentials.

When you use the {product-title} CLI or web console, your API token
authenticates you to the API. You can associate a component with a service account
so that they can access the API without using a regular user&#8217;s credentials.

Each service account&#8217;s user name is derived from its project and name:


```text
system:serviceaccount:<project>:<name>
```


Every service account is also a member of two groups:



# Default service accounts

Your {product-title} cluster contains default service accounts for
cluster management and generates more service accounts for each project.

## Default cluster service accounts

Several infrastructure controllers run using service account credentials. The
following service accounts are created in the {product-title} infrastructure
project (openshift-infra) at server start, and given the following roles
cluster-wide:



## Default project service accounts and roles

Three service accounts are automatically created in each project:



All service accounts in a project are given the system:image-puller role,
which allows pulling images from any image stream in the project using the
internal container image registry.

## Automatically generated image pull secrets

By default, {product-title} creates an image pull secret for each service account.


[NOTE]
----
Prior to {product-title} 4.16, a long-lived service account API token secret was also generated for each service account that was created. Starting with {product-title} 4.16, this service account API token secret is no longer created.
After upgrading to {product-version}, any existing long-lived service account API token secrets are not deleted and will continue to function. For information about detecting long-lived API tokens that are in use in your cluster or deleting them if they are not needed, see the Red Hat Knowledgebase article Long-lived service account API tokens in OpenShift Container Platform.
----

This image pull secret is necessary to integrate the OpenShift image registry into the cluster&#8217;s user authentication and authorization system.

However, if you do not enable the ImageRegistry capability or if you disable the integrated OpenShift image registry in the Cluster Image Registry Operator&#8217;s configuration, an image pull secret is not generated for each service account.

When the integrated OpenShift image registry is disabled on a cluster that previously had it enabled, the previously generated image pull secrets are deleted automatically.

# Creating service accounts

You can create a service account in a project and grant it permissions by
binding it to a role.

1. Optional: To view the service accounts in the current project:

```terminal
$ oc get sa
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME       SECRETS   AGE
builder    1         2d
default    1         2d
deployer   1         2d
```

2. To create a new service account in the current project:

```terminal
$ oc create sa <service_account_name> 1
```

To create a service account in a different project, specify -n <project_name>.
Example output

```terminal
serviceaccount "robot" created
```


[TIP]
----
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to create the service account:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: <service_account_name>
  namespace: <current_project>
```

----
3. Optional: View the secrets for the service account:

```terminal
$ oc describe sa robot
```

Example output

```terminal
Name:                robot
Namespace:           project1
Labels:              <none>
Annotations:         openshift.io/internal-registry-pull-secret-ref: robot-dockercfg-qzbhb
Image pull secrets:  robot-dockercfg-qzbhb
Mountable secrets:   robot-dockercfg-qzbhb
Tokens:              <none>
Events:              <none>
```
