# Adding user preferences


You can change the default preferences for your profile to meet your requirements. You can set your default project, topology view (graph or list), editing medium (form or YAML), language preferences, and resource type.
The changes made to the user preferences are automatically saved.

# Setting user preferences

You can set the default user preferences for your cluster.

1. Log in to the {product-title} web console using your login credentials.
2. Use the masthead to access the user preferences under the user profile.
3. In the General section:
1. In the Theme field, you can set the theme that you want to work in. The console defaults to the selected theme each time you log in.
2. In the Project field, select a project you want to work in. The console defaults to the project every time you log in.
3. In the Topology field, you can set the topology view to default to the graph or list view. If not selected, the console defaults to the last view you used.
4. In the Create/Edit resource method field, you can set a preference for creating or editing a resource. If both the form and YAML options are available, the console defaults to your selection.
4. In the Language section, select Default browser language to use the default browser language settings. Otherwise, select the language that you want to use for the console.
5. In the Notifications section, you can toggle display notifications created by users for specific projects on the Overview page or notification drawer.
6. In the Applications section:
1. You can view the default Resource type. For example, if the OpenShift Serverless Operator is installed, the default resource type is Serverless Deployment. Otherwise, the default resource type is Deployment.
2. You can select another resource type to be the default resource type from the Resource Type field.
