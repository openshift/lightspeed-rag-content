# Configuring the web console in {product-title}


You can modify the {product-title} web console to set a logout redirect URL
or disable the quick start tutorials.

# Prerequisites

* Deploy an {product-title} cluster.

# Configuring the web console

You can configure the web console settings by editing the console.config.openshift.io resource.

* Edit the console.config.openshift.io resource:

```terminal
$ oc edit console.config.openshift.io cluster
```


The following example displays the sample resource definition for the console:

```yaml
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Console
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  authentication:
    logoutRedirect: "" 1
status:
  consoleURL: "" 2
```

Specify the URL of the page to load when a user logs out of the web console. If you do not specify a value, the user returns to the login page for the web console. Specifying a logoutRedirect URL allows your users to perform single logout (SLO) through the identity provider to destroy their single sign-on session.
The web console URL. To update this to a custom value, see Customizing the web console URL.

# Disabling quick starts in the web console

You can use the Administrator perspective of the web console to disable one or more quick starts.

* You have cluster administrator permissions and are logged in to the web console.

1. In the Administrator perspective, navigate to Administation -> Cluster Settings.
2. On the Cluster Settings page, click the Configuration tab.
3. On the Configuration page, click the Console configuration resource with the description operator.openshift.io.
