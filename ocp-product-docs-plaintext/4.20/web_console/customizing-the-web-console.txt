# Customizing the web console in {product-title}


You can customize the {product-title} web console to set a custom logo,
product name, links, notifications, and command-line downloads. This is
especially helpful if you need to tailor the web console to meet specific
corporate or government requirements.

# Adding a custom logo and product name

You can create custom branding by adding a custom logo or custom product name. You can set both or one without the other, as these settings are independent of each other.

* You must have administrator privileges.
* Create a file of the logo that you want to use. The logo can be a file in any common image format, including GIF, JPG, PNG, or SVG, and is constrained to a max-height of 60px. Image size must not exceed 1 MB due to constraints on the ConfigMap object size.

1. Import your logo file into a config map in the openshift-config namespace:

```terminal
$ oc create configmap console-custom-logo --from-file /path/to/console-custom-logo.png -n openshift-config
```


[TIP]
----
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to create the config map:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: console-custom-logo
  namespace: openshift-config
binaryData:
  console-custom-logo.png: <base64-encoded_logo> ... 1
```

Provide a valid base64-encoded logo.
----
2. Edit the web console's Operator configuration to include customLogoFile and customProductName:

```terminal
$ oc edit consoles.operator.openshift.io cluster
```


```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Console
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  customization:
    customLogoFile:
      key: console-custom-logo.png
      name: console-custom-logo
    customProductName: My Console
```


Once the Operator configuration is updated, it will sync the custom logo config map into the console namespace, mount it to the console pod, and redeploy.
3. Check for success. If there are any issues, the console cluster Operator will report a Degraded status, and the console Operator configuration will also report a CustomLogoDegraded status, but with reasons like KeyOrFilenameInvalid or NoImageProvided.

To check the clusteroperator, run:

```terminal
$ oc get clusteroperator console -o yaml
```


To check the console Operator configuration, run:

```terminal
$ oc get consoles.operator.openshift.io -o yaml
```


# Creating custom links in the web console

* You must have administrator privileges.

1. From Administration -> Custom Resource Definitions, click on
ConsoleLink.
2. Select Instances tab
3. Click Create Console Link and edit the file:

```yaml
apiVersion: console.openshift.io/v1
kind: ConsoleLink
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  href: 'https://www.example.com'
  location: HelpMenu 1
  text: Link 1
```

Valid location settings are HelpMenu, UserMenu, ApplicationMenu, and
NamespaceDashboard.

To make the custom link appear in all namespaces, follow this example:

```yaml
apiVersion: console.openshift.io/v1
kind: ConsoleLink
metadata:
  name: namespaced-dashboard-link-for-all-namespaces
spec:
  href: 'https://www.example.com'
  location: NamespaceDashboard
  text: This appears in all namespaces
```


To make the custom link appear in only some namespaces, follow this example:

```yaml
apiVersion: console.openshift.io/v1
kind: ConsoleLink
metadata:
  name: namespaced-dashboard-for-some-namespaces
spec:
  href: 'https://www.example.com'
  location: NamespaceDashboard
  # This text will appear in a box called "Launcher" under "namespace" or "project" in the web console
  text: Custom Link Text
  namespaceDashboard:
    namespaces:
    # for these specific namespaces
    - my-namespace
    - your-namespace
    - other-namespace
```


To make the custom link appear in the application menu, follow this example:

```yaml
apiVersion: console.openshift.io/v1
kind: ConsoleLink
metadata:
  name: application-menu-link-1
spec:
  href: 'https://www.example.com'
  location: ApplicationMenu
  text: Link 1
  applicationMenu:
    section: My New Section
    # image that is 24x24 in size
    imageURL: https://via.placeholder.com/24
```

# Customizing console routes

For console and downloads routes, custom routes functionality uses the ingress config route configuration API. If the console custom route is set up in both the ingress config and console-operator config, then the new ingress config custom route configuration takes precedent. The route configuration with the console-operator config is deprecated.

## Customizing the console route

You can customize the console route by setting the custom hostname and TLS certificate in the spec.componentRoutes field of the cluster Ingress configuration.

* You have logged in to the cluster as a user with administrative privileges.
* You have created a secret in the openshift-config namespace containing the TLS certificate and key. This is required if the domain for the custom hostname suffix does not match the cluster domain suffix. The secret is optional if the suffix matches.

[TIP]
----
You can create a TLS secret by using the oc create secret tls command.
----

1. Edit the cluster Ingress configuration:

```terminal
$ oc edit ingress.config.openshift.io cluster
```

2. Set the custom hostname and optionally the serving certificate and key:

```yaml
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  componentRoutes:
    - name: console
      namespace: openshift-console
      hostname: <custom_hostname> 1
      servingCertKeyPairSecret:
        name: <secret_name> 2
```

The custom hostname.
Reference to a secret in the openshift-config namespace that contains a TLS certificate (tls.crt) and key (tls.key). This is required if the domain for the custom hostname suffix does not match the cluster domain suffix. The secret is optional if the suffix matches.
3. Save the file to apply the changes.


[NOTE]
----
Add a DNS record for the custom console route that points to the application ingress load balancer.
----

## Customizing the download route

You can customize the download route by setting the custom hostname and TLS certificate in the spec.componentRoutes field of the cluster Ingress configuration.

* You have logged in to the cluster as a user with administrative privileges.
* You have created a secret in the openshift-config namespace containing the TLS certificate and key. This is required if the domain for the custom hostname suffix does not match the cluster domain suffix. The secret is optional if the suffix matches.

[TIP]
----
You can create a TLS secret by using the oc create secret tls command.
----

1. Edit the cluster Ingress configuration:

```terminal
$ oc edit ingress.config.openshift.io cluster
```

2. Set the custom hostname and optionally the serving certificate and key:

```yaml
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  componentRoutes:
    - name: downloads
      namespace: openshift-console
      hostname: <custom_hostname> 1
      servingCertKeyPairSecret:
        name: <secret_name> 2
```

The custom hostname.
Reference to a secret in the openshift-config namespace that contains a TLS certificate (tls.crt) and key (tls.key). This is required if the domain for the custom hostname suffix does not match the cluster domain suffix. The secret is optional if the suffix matches.
3. Save the file to apply the changes.


[NOTE]
----
Add a DNS record for the custom downloads route that points to the application ingress load balancer.

# Customizing the login page

Create Terms of Service information with custom login pages. Custom login pages
can also be helpful if you use a third-party login provider, such as GitHub or
Google, to show users a branded page that they trust and expect before being
redirected to the authentication provider. You can also render custom error
pages during the authentication process.


[NOTE]
----
Customizing the error template is limited to identity providers (IDPs) that use redirects, such as request header and OIDC-based IDPs. It does not have an effect on IDPs that use direct password authentication, such as LDAP and htpasswd.
----

* You must have administrator privileges.

1. Run the following commands to create templates you can modify:

```terminal
$ oc adm create-login-template > login.html
```


```terminal
$ oc adm create-provider-selection-template > providers.html
```


```terminal
$ oc adm create-error-template > errors.html
```

2. Create the secrets:

```terminal
$ oc create secret generic login-template --from-file=login.html -n openshift-config
```


```terminal
$ oc create secret generic providers-template --from-file=providers.html -n openshift-config
```


```terminal
$ oc create secret generic error-template --from-file=errors.html -n openshift-config
```

3. Run:

```terminal
$ oc edit oauths cluster
```

4. Update the specification:

```yaml
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: OAuth
metadata:
  name: cluster
# ...
spec:
  templates:
    error:
        name: error-template
    login:
        name: login-template
    providerSelection:
        name: providers-template
```


Run oc explain oauths.spec.templates to understand the options.

# Customizing user perspectives

The {product-title} web console provides two perspectives by default, Administrator and Developer. You might have more perspectives available depending on installed console plugins. As a cluster administrator, you can show or hide a perspective for all users or for a specific user role. Customizing  perspectives ensures that users can view only the perspectives that are applicable to their role and tasks. For example, you can hide the Administrator perspective from unprivileged users so that they cannot manage cluster resources, users, and projects. Similarly, you can show the Developer perspective to users with the developer role so that they can create, deploy, and monitor applications.

You can also customize the perspective visibility for users based on role-based access control (RBAC). For example, if you customize a perspective for monitoring purposes, which requires specific permissions, you can define that the perspective is visible only to users with required permissions.

Each perspective includes the following mandatory parameters, which you can edit in the YAML view:

* id: Defines the ID of the perspective to show or hide
* visibility: Defines the state of the perspective along with access review checks, if needed
* state: Defines whether the perspective is enabled, disabled, or needs an access review check


[NOTE]
----
By default, all perspectives are enabled. When you customize the user perspective, your changes are applicable to the entire cluster.
----

## Customizing a perspective using YAML view

* You must have administrator privileges.

1. In the Administrator perspective, navigate to Administration -> Cluster Settings.
2. Select the Configuration tab and click the Console (operator.openshift.io) resource.
3. Click the YAML tab and make your customization:
1. To enable or disable a perspective, insert the snippet for Add user perspectives and edit the YAML code as needed:

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1

spec:
  customization:
    perspectives:
      - id: admin
        visibility:
          state: Enabled
      - id: dev
        visibility:
          state: Enabled
```

2. To hide a perspective based on RBAC permissions, insert the snippet for Hide user perspectives and edit the YAML code as needed:

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Console
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  customization:
    perspectives:
      - id: admin
        requiresAccessReview:

            resource: clusterroles
            verb: list
      - id: dev
        state: Enabled
```

3. To customize a perspective based on your needs, create your own YAML snippet:

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Console
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  customization:
    perspectives:
      - id: admin
        visibility:
          state: AccessReview
          accessReview:
            missing:
              - resource: deployment
                verb: list
            required:
              - resource: namespaces
                verb: list
      - id: dev

# Developer catalog and sub-catalog customization

As a cluster administrator, you have the ability to organize and manage the Developer catalog or its sub-catalogs. You can enable or disable the sub-catalog types or disable the entire developer catalog.

The developerCatalog.types object includes the following parameters that you must define in a snippet to use them in the YAML view:

* state: Defines if a list of developer catalog types should be enabled or disabled.
* enabled: Defines a list of developer catalog types (sub-catalogs) that are visible to users.
* disabled: Defines a list of developer catalog types (sub-catalogs) that are not visible to users.

You can enable or disable the following developer catalog types (sub-catalogs) using the YAML view or the form view.

* Builder Images
* Templates
* Devfiles
* Samples
* Helm Charts
* Event Sources
* Event Sinks
* Operator Backed

### Example YAML file changes

You can dynamically add the following snippets in the YAML editor for customizing a developer catalog.

Use the following snippet to display all the sub-catalogs by setting the state type to Enabled.


```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Console
metadata:
  name: cluster
...
spec:
  customization:
    developerCatalog:
      categories:
      types:
        state: Enabled
```


Use the following snippet to disable all sub-catalogs by setting the state type to Disabled:


```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Console
metadata:
  name: cluster
...
spec:
  customization:
    developerCatalog:
      categories:
      types:
        state: Disabled
```


Use the following snippet when a cluster administrator defines a list of sub-catalogs, which are enabled in the Web Console.


```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Console
metadata:
  name: cluster
...
spec:
  customization:
    developerCatalog:
