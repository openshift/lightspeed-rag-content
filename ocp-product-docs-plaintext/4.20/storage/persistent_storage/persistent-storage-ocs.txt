# Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation



Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation is a provider of agnostic persistent storage for {product-title} supporting file, block, and object storage, either in-house or in hybrid clouds. As a Red Hat storage solution, Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation is completely integrated with {product-title} for deployment, management, and monitoring. For more information, see the Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation documentation.


[IMPORTANT]
----
OpenShift Data Foundation on top of Red Hat Hyperconverged Infrastructure (RHHI) for Virtualization, which uses hyperconverged nodes that host virtual machines installed with {product-title}, is not a supported configuration. For more information about supported platforms, see the Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation Supportability and Interoperability Guide.
