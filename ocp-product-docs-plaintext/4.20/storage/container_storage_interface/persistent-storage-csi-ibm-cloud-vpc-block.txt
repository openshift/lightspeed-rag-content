# IBM Cloud VPC Block CSI Driver Operator



# Overview

{product-title} is capable of provisioning persistent volumes (PVs) using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for IBM&#174; Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Block Storage.

Familiarity with persistent storage and configuring CSI volumes is recommended when working with a CSI Operator and driver.

To create CSI-provisioned PVs that mount to IBM Cloud&#174; VPC Block storage assets, {product-title} installs the IBM Cloud&#174; VPC Block CSI Driver Operator and the IBM Cloud&#174; VPC Block CSI driver by default in the openshift-cluster-csi-drivers namespace.

* The IBM Cloud(R) VPC Block CSI Driver Operator provides three storage classes named ibmc-vpc-block-10iops-tier (default), ibmc-vpc-block-5iops-tier, and ibmc-vpc-block-custom for different tiers that you can use to create persistent volume claims (PVCs). The IBM Cloud(R) VPC Block CSI Driver Operator supports dynamic volume provisioning by allowing storage volumes to be created on demand, eliminating the need for cluster administrators to pre-provision storage. You can disable this default storage class if desired (see Managing the default storage class).
* The IBM Cloud(R) VPC Block CSI driver enables you to create and mount IBM Cloud(R) VPC Block PVs.

# About CSI

Storage vendors have traditionally provided storage drivers as part of Kubernetes. With the implementation of the Container Storage Interface (CSI), third-party providers can instead deliver storage plugins using a standard interface without ever having to change the core Kubernetes code.

CSI Operators give {product-title} users storage options, such as volume snapshots, that are not possible with in-tree volume plugins.

# User-managed encryption

The user-managed encryption feature allows you to provide keys during installation that encrypt {product-title} node root volumes, and enables all managed storage classes to use these keys to encrypt provisioned storage volumes. You must specify the custom key in the platform.<cloud_type>.defaultMachinePlatform field in the install-config YAML file.

This features supports the following storage types:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Block storage (EBS)
* Microsoft Azure Disk storage
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP) persistent disk (PD) storage
* IBM Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Block storage
