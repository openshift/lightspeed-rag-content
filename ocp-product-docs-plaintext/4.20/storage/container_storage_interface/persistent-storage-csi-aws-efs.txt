# AWS Elastic File Service CSI Driver Operator



# Overview

{product-title} is capable of provisioning persistent volumes (PVs) using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for AWS Elastic File Service (EFS).

Familiarity with persistent storage and configuring CSI volumes is recommended when working with a CSI Operator and driver.

After installing the AWS EFS CSI Driver Operator, {product-title} installs the AWS EFS CSI Operator and the AWS EFS CSI driver by default in the openshift-cluster-csi-drivers namespace. This allows the AWS EFS CSI Driver Operator to create CSI-provisioned PVs that mount to AWS EFS assets.

* The AWS EFS CSI Driver Operator, after being installed, does not create a storage class by default to use to create persistent volume claims (PVCs). However, you can manually create the AWS EFS StorageClass.
The AWS EFS CSI Driver Operator supports dynamic volume provisioning by allowing storage volumes to be created on-demand.
This eliminates the need for cluster administrators to pre-provision storage.
* The AWS EFS CSI driver enables you to create and mount AWS EFS PVs.


[NOTE]
----
AWS EFS only supports regional volumes, not zonal volumes.
----

# About CSI

Storage vendors have traditionally provided storage drivers as part of Kubernetes. With the implementation of the Container Storage Interface (CSI), third-party providers can instead deliver storage plugins using a standard interface without ever having to change the core Kubernetes code.

CSI Operators give {product-title} users storage options, such as volume snapshots, that are not possible with in-tree volume plugins.

# Setting up the AWS EFS CSI Driver Operator

1. If you are using {FeatureName} with AWS Secure Token Service (STS), obtain a role Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for STS. This is required for installing the {FeatureName} CSI Driver Operator.
2. Install the {FeatureName} CSI Driver Operator.
3. Install the {FeatureName} CSI Driver.

## Obtaining a role Amazon Resource Name for Security Token Service

This procedure explains how to obtain a role Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to configure the AWS EFS CSI Driver Operator with {product-title} on AWS Security Token Service (STS).


[IMPORTANT]
----
Perform this procedure before you install the AWS EFS CSI Driver Operator (see Installing the AWS EFS CSI Driver Operator procedure).
----

* Access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* AWS account credentials

You can obtain the ARN role in multiple ways. The following procedure shows one method that uses the same concept and CCO utility (ccoctl) binary tool as cluster installation.

To obtain a role ARN for configuring AWS EFS CSI Driver Operator using STS:

1. Extract the ccoctl from the {product-title} release image, which you used to install the cluster with STS. For more information, see "Configuring the Cloud Credential Operator utility".
2. Create and save an EFS CredentialsRequest YAML file, such as shown in the following example, and then place it in the credrequests directory:
Example

```yaml
apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
kind: CredentialsRequest
metadata:
  name: openshift-aws-efs-csi-driver
  namespace: openshift-cloud-credential-operator
spec:
  providerSpec:
    apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
    kind: AWSProviderSpec
    statementEntries:
    - action:
      - elasticfilesystem:*
      effect: Allow
      resource: '*'
  secretRef:
    name: aws-efs-cloud-credentials
    namespace: openshift-cluster-csi-drivers
  serviceAccountNames:
  - aws-efs-csi-driver-operator
  - aws-efs-csi-driver-controller-sa
```

3. Run the ccoctl tool to generate a new IAM role in AWS, and create a YAML file for it in the local file system (<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/manifests/openshift-cluster-csi-drivers-aws-efs-cloud-credentials-credentials.yaml).

```terminal
$ ccoctl aws create-iam-roles --name=<name> --region=<aws_region> --credentials-requests-dir=<path_to_directory_with_list_of_credentials_requests>/credrequests --identity-provider-arn=arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_id>:oidc-provider/<name>-oidc.s3.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com
```

* name=<name> is the name used to tag any cloud resources that are created for tracking.
* region=<aws_region> is the AWS region where cloud resources are created.
* dir=<path_to_directory_with_list_of_credentials_requests>/credrequests is the directory containing the EFS CredentialsRequest file in previous step.
* <aws_account_id> is the AWS account ID.
Example

```terminal
$ ccoctl aws create-iam-roles --name my-aws-efs --credentials-requests-dir credrequests --identity-provider-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:oidc-provider/my-aws-efs-oidc.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com
```

Example output

```terminal
2022/03/21 06:24:44 Role arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-aws-efs -openshift-cluster-csi-drivers-aws-efs-cloud- created
2022/03/21 06:24:44 Saved credentials configuration to: /manifests/openshift-cluster-csi-drivers-aws-efs-cloud-credentials-credentials.yaml
2022/03/21 06:24:45 Updated Role policy for Role my-aws-efs-openshift-cluster-csi-drivers-aws-efs-cloud-
```

4. Copy the role ARN from the first line of the Example output in the preceding step. The role ARN is between "Role" and "created". In this example, the role ARN is "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-aws-efs -openshift-cluster-csi-drivers-aws-efs-cloud".

You will need the role ARN when you install the AWS EFS CSI Driver Operator.

Install the AWS EFS CSI Driver Operator.

* Installing the AWS EFS CSI Driver Operator
* Configuring the Cloud Credential Operator utility
* Installing the {FeatureName} CSI Driver

## Installing the AWS EFS CSI Driver Operator

The {FeatureName} CSI Driver Operator (a Red&#160;Hat Operator) is not installed in {product-title} by default. Use the following procedure to install and configure the {FeatureName} CSI Driver Operator in your cluster.

* Access to the {product-title} web console.

To install the {FeatureName} CSI Driver Operator from the web console:

1. Log in to the web console.
2. Install the {FeatureName} CSI Operator:
1. Click Operators -> OperatorHub.
2. Locate the {FeatureName} CSI Operator by typing {FeatureName} CSI in the filter box.
3. Click the {FeatureName} CSI Driver Operator button.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Be sure to select the {FeatureName} CSI Driver Operator and not the {FeatureName} Operator. The {FeatureName} Operator is a community Operator and is not supported by Red Hat.
----
1. On the {FeatureName} CSI Driver Operator page, click Install.
2. On the Install Operator page, ensure that:
* All namespaces on the cluster (default) is selected.
* Installed Namespace is set to openshift-cluster-csi-drivers.
3. Click Install.

After the installation finishes, the {FeatureName} CSI Operator is listed in the Installed Operators section of the web console.

Install the AWS EFS CSI Driver.

## Installing the AWS EFS CSI Driver

After installing the {FeatureName} CSI Driver Operator (a Red Hat operator), you install the {FeatureName} CSI driver.

* Access to the {product-title} web console.

1. Click Administration -> CustomResourceDefinitions -> ClusterCSIDriver.
2. On the Instances tab, click Create ClusterCSIDriver.
3. Use the following YAML file:

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterCSIDriver
metadata:
    name: efs.csi.aws.com
spec:
  managementState: Managed
```

4. Click Create.
5. Wait for the following Conditions to change to a "True" status:
* AWSEFSDriverNodeServiceControllerAvailable
* AWSEFSDriverControllerServiceControllerAvailable

# Creating the AWS EFS storage class

Storage classes are used to differentiate and delineate storage levels and
usages. By defining a storage class, users can obtain dynamically provisioned
persistent volumes.

The AWS EFS CSI Driver Operator (a Red Hat operator), after being installed, does not create a storage class by default. However, you can manually create the AWS EFS storage class.

## Creating the AWS EFS storage class using the console

1. In the {product-title} web console, click Storage -> StorageClasses.
2. On the StorageClasses page, click Create StorageClass.
3. On the StorageClass page, perform the following steps:
1. Enter a name to reference the storage class.
2. Optional: Enter the description.
3. Select the reclaim policy.
4. Select {Provisioner} from the Provisioner drop-down list.
5. Optional: Set the configuration parameters for the selected provisioner.
4. Click Create.

## Creating the AWS EFS storage class using the CLI

* Create a StorageClass object:

```yaml
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: efs-sc
provisioner: efs.csi.aws.com
parameters:
  provisioningMode: efs-ap 1
  fileSystemId: fs-a5324911 2
  directoryPerms: "700" 3
  gidRangeStart: "1000" 4
  gidRangeEnd: "2000" 4
  basePath: "/dynamic_provisioning" 5
```

provisioningMode must be efs-ap to enable dynamic provisioning.
fileSystemId must be the ID of the EFS volume created manually.
directoryPerms is the default permission of the root directory of the volume. In this example, the volume is accessible only by the owner.
gidRangeStart and gidRangeEnd set the range of POSIX Group IDs (GIDs) that are used to set the GID of the AWS access point. If not specified, the default range is 50000-7000000. Each provisioned volume, and thus AWS access point, is assigned a unique GID from this range.
basePath is the directory on the EFS volume that is used to create dynamically provisioned volumes. In this case, a PV is provisioned as “/dynamic_provisioning/<random uuid>” on the EFS volume. Only the subdirectory is mounted to pods that use the PV.

[NOTE]
----
A cluster admin can create several StorageClass objects, each using a different EFS volume.
----

# Creating and configuring access to EFS volumes in AWS

This procedure explains how to create and configure EFS volumes in AWS so that you can use them in {product-title}.

* AWS account credentials

To create and configure access to an EFS volume in AWS:

1. On the AWS console, open https://console.aws.amazon.com/efs.
2. Click Create file system:
* Enter a name for the file system.
* For Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), select the virtual private cloud (VPC) for your {product-title} cluster.
* Accept default settings for all other selections.
3. Wait for the volume and mount targets to finish being fully created:
1. Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/efs#/file-systems.
2. Click your volume, and on the Network tab wait for all mount targets to become available (~1-2 minutes).
4. On the Network tab, copy the Security Group ID (you will need this in the next step).
5. Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home#SecurityGroups, and find the Security Group used by the EFS volume.
6. On the Inbound rules tab, click Edit inbound rules, and then add a new rule with the following settings to allow {product-title} nodes to access EFS volumes :
* Type: NFS
* Protocol: TCP
* Port range: 2049
* Source: Custom/IP address range of your nodes (for example: “10.0.0.0/16”)

This step allows {product-title} to use NFS ports from the cluster.
7. Save the rule.

# Dynamic provisioning for Amazon Elastic File Storage

The AWS EFS CSI driver supports a different form of dynamic provisioning than other CSI drivers. It provisions new PVs as subdirectories of a pre-existing EFS volume. The PVs are independent of each other. However, they all share the same EFS volume. When the volume is deleted, all PVs provisioned out of it are deleted too.
The EFS CSI driver creates an AWS Access Point for each such subdirectory. Due to AWS AccessPoint limits, you can only dynamically provision 1000 PVs from a single StorageClass/EFS volume.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Note that PVC.spec.resources is not enforced by EFS.
In the example below, you request 5 GiB of space. However, the created PV is limitless and can store any amount of data (like petabytes). A broken application, or even a rogue application, can cause significant expenses when it stores too much data on the volume.
Using monitoring of EFS volume sizes in AWS is strongly recommended.
----

* You have created Amazon Elastic File Storage (Amazon EFS) volumes.
* You have created the AWS EFS storage class.

To enable dynamic provisioning:

* Create a PVC (or StatefulSet or Template) as usual, referring to the StorageClass created previously.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: test
spec:
  storageClassName: efs-sc
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
```


If you have problems setting up dynamic provisioning, see AWS EFS troubleshooting.

* Creating and configuring access to AWS EFS volume(s)
* Creating the AWS EFS storage class

# Creating static PVs with Amazon Elastic File Storage

It is possible to use an Amazon Elastic File Storage (Amazon EFS) volume as a single PV without any dynamic provisioning. The whole volume is mounted to pods.

* You have created Amazon EFS volumes.

* Create the PV using the following YAML file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: efs-pv
spec:
  capacity: 1
    storage: 5Gi
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  csi:
    driver: efs.csi.aws.com
    volumeHandle: fs-ae66151a 2
    volumeAttributes:
      encryptInTransit: "false" 3
```

spec.capacity does not have any meaning and is ignored by the CSI driver. It is used only when binding to a PVC. Applications can store any amount of data to the volume.
volumeHandle must be the same ID as the EFS volume you created in AWS. If you are providing your own access point, volumeHandle should be <EFS volume ID>::<access point ID>. For example: fs-6e633ada::fsap-081a1d293f0004630.
If desired, you can disable encryption in transit. Encryption is enabled by default.

If you have problems setting up static PVs, see AWS EFS troubleshooting.

# Amazon Elastic File Storage security

The following information is important for Amazon Elastic File Storage (Amazon EFS) security.

When using access points, for example, by using dynamic provisioning as described earlier, Amazon automatically replaces GIDs on files with the GID of the access point. In addition, EFS considers the user ID, group ID, and secondary group IDs of the access point when evaluating file system permissions. EFS ignores the NFS client&#8217;s IDs. For more information about access points, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/efs-access-points.html.

As a consequence, EFS volumes silently ignore FSGroup; {product-title} is not able to replace the GIDs of files on the volume with FSGroup. Any pod that can access a mounted EFS access point can access any file on it.

Unrelated to this, encryption in transit is enabled by default. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/encryption-in-transit.html.

# AWS EFS storage CSI usage metrics

## Usage metrics overview

Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic File Service (EFS) storage Container Storage Interface (CSI) usage metrics allow you to monitor how much space is used by either dynamically or statically provisioned EFS volumes.


[IMPORTANT]
----
This features is disabled by default, because turning on metrics can lead to performance degradation.
----

The AWS EFS usage metrics feature collects volume metrics in the AWS EFS CSI Driver by recursively walking through the files in the volume. Because this effort can degrade performance, administrators must explicitly enable this feature.

## Enabling usage metrics using the web console

To enable Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic File Service (EFS) Storage Container Storage Interface (CSI) usage metrics using the web console:

1. Click Administration > CustomResourceDefinitions.
2. On the CustomResourceDefinitions page next to the Name dropdown box, type clustercsidriver.
3. Click CRD ClusterCSIDriver.
4. Click the YAML tab.
5. Under spec.aws.efsVolumeMetrics.state, set the value to RecursiveWalk.

RecursiveWalk indicates that volume metrics collection in the AWS EFS CSI Driver is performed by recursively walking through the files in the volume.
Example ClusterCSIDriver efs.csi.aws.com YAML file

```yaml
spec:
    driverConfig:
        driverType: AWS
        aws:
            efsVolumeMetrics:
              state: RecursiveWalk
              recursiveWalk:
                refreshPeriodMinutes: 100
                fsRateLimit: 10
```

6. Optional: To define how the recursive walk operates, you can also set the following fields:
* refreshPeriodMinutes: Specifies the refresh frequency for volume metrics in minutes. If this field is left blank, a reasonable default is chosen, which is subject to change over time. The current default is 240 minutes. The valid range is 1 to 43,200 minutes.
* fsRateLimit: Defines the rate limit for processing volume metrics in goroutines per file system. If this field is left blank, a reasonable default is chosen, which is subject to change over time. The current default is 5 goroutines. The valid range is 1 to 100 goroutines.
7. Click Save.


[NOTE]
----
To disable AWS EFS CSI usage metrics, use the preceding procedure, but for spec.aws.efsVolumeMetrics.state, change the value from RecursiveWalk to Disabled.
----

## Enabling usage metrics using the CLI

To enable Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic File Service (EFS) storage Container Storage Interface (CSI) usage metrics using the CLI:

1. Edit ClusterCSIDriver by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc edit clustercsidriver efs.csi.aws.com
```

2. Under spec.aws.efsVolumeMetrics.state, set the value to RecursiveWalk.

RecursiveWalk indicates that volume metrics collection in the AWS EFS CSI Driver is performed by recursively walking through the files in the volume.
Example ClusterCSIDriver efs.csi.aws.com YAML file

```yaml
spec:
    driverConfig:
        driverType: AWS
        aws:
            efsVolumeMetrics:
              state: RecursiveWalk
              recursiveWalk:
                refreshPeriodMinutes: 100
                fsRateLimit: 10
```

3. Optional: To define how the recursive walk operates, you can also set the following fields:
* refreshPeriodMinutes: Specifies the refresh frequency for volume metrics in minutes. If this field is left blank, a reasonable default is chosen, which is subject to change over time. The current default is 240 minutes. The valid range is 1 to 43,200 minutes.
* fsRateLimit: Defines the rate limit for processing volume metrics in goroutines per file system. If this field is left blank, a reasonable default is chosen, which is subject to change over time. The current default is 5 goroutines. The valid range is 1 to 100 goroutines.
4. Save the changes to the efs.csi.aws.com object.


[NOTE]
----
To disable AWS EFS CSI usage metrics, use the preceding procedure, but for spec.aws.efsVolumeMetrics.state, change the value from RecursiveWalk to Disabled.
----

# Amazon Elastic File Storage troubleshooting

The following information provides guidance on how to troubleshoot issues with Amazon Elastic File Storage (Amazon EFS):

* The AWS EFS Operator and CSI driver run in namespace openshift-cluster-csi-drivers.
* To initiate gathering of logs of the AWS EFS Operator and CSI driver, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc adm must-gather
[must-gather      ] OUT Using must-gather plugin-in image: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-art-dev@sha256:125f183d13601537ff15b3239df95d47f0a604da2847b561151fedd699f5e3a5

```

* To show AWS EFS Operator errors, view the ClusterCSIDriver status:

```terminal
$ oc get clustercsidriver efs.csi.aws.com -o yaml
```

* If a volume cannot be mounted to a pod (as shown in the output of the following command):

```terminal
$ oc describe pod
