Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) v1 uses the catalogd component and its resources to manage Operator and extension catalogs.

# About catalogs in OLM v1

You can discover installable content by querying a catalog for Kubernetes extensions, such as Operators and controllers, by using the catalogd component. Catalogd is a Kubernetes extension that unpacks catalog content for on-cluster clients and is part of the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) v1 suite of microservices. Currently, catalogd unpacks catalog content that is packaged and distributed as container images.
