# OLM v1 components overview



Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) v1 comprises the following component projects:

Operator Controller:: Operator Controller is the central component of OLM v1 that extends Kubernetes with an API through which users can install and manage the lifecycle of Operators and extensions. It consumes information from catalogd.
Catalogd:: Catalogd is a Kubernetes extension that unpacks file-based catalog (FBC) content packaged and shipped in container images for consumption by on-cluster clients. As a component of the OLM v1 microservices architecture, catalogd hosts metadata for Kubernetes extensions packaged by the authors of the extensions, and as a result helps users discover installable content.
