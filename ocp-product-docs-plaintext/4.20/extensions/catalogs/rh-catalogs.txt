# Red Hat-provided  catalogs


Red Hat provides several Operator catalogs that are included with {product-title} by default.

# About Red Hat-provided Operator catalogs

The Red Hat-provided catalog sources are installed by default in the {global_ns} namespace, which makes the catalogs available cluster-wide in all namespaces.

The following Operator catalogs are distributed by Red Hat:



During a cluster upgrade, the index image tag for the default Red Hat-provided catalog sources are updated automatically by the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) so that Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) pulls the updated version of the catalog. For example during an upgrade from {product-title} 4.8 to 4.9, the spec.image field in the CatalogSource object for the redhat-operators catalog is updated from:


```terminal
registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.8
```


to:


```terminal
registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.9
```
