# Dynamic Accelerator Slicer (DAS) Operator



[IMPORTANT]
----
Dynamic Accelerator Slicer Operator is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
----
The Dynamic Accelerator Slicer (DAS) Operator allows you to dynamically slice GPU accelerators in {product-title}, instead of relying on statically sliced GPUs defined when the node is booted. This allows you to dynamically slice GPUs based on specific workload demands, ensuring efficient resource utilization.
Dynamic slicing is useful if you do not know all the accelerator partitions needed in advance on every node on the cluster.
The DAS Operator currently includes a reference implementation for NVIDIA Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) and is designed to support additional technologies such as NVIDIA MPS or GPUs from other vendors in the future.
The following limitations apply when using the Dynamic Accelerator Slicer Operator:
* You need to identify potential incompatibilities and ensure the system works seamlessly with various GPU drivers and operating systems.
* The Operator only works with specific MIG compatible NVIDIA GPUs and drivers, such as H100 and A100.
* The Operator cannot use only a subset of the GPUs of a node.
* The NVIDIA device plugin cannot be used together with the Dynamic Accelerator Slicer Operator to manage the GPU resources of a cluster.

[NOTE]
----
The DAS Operator is designed to work with MIG-enabled GPUs. It allocates MIG slices instead of whole GPUs. Installing the DAS Operator prevents the use of the standard resource request through the NVIDIA device plugin such as nvidia.com/gpu: "1", for allocating the entire GPU.

1. Check the status of all DAS Operator components by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get pods -n das-operator
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
das-daemonset-6rsfd                     1/1     Running   0          5m16s
das-daemonset-8qzgf                     1/1     Running   0          5m16s
das-operator-5946478b47-cjfcp           1/1     Running   0          5m18s
das-operator-5946478b47-npwmn           1/1     Running   0          5m18s
das-operator-webhook-59949d4f85-5n9qt   1/1     Running   0          68s
das-operator-webhook-59949d4f85-nbtdl   1/1     Running   0          68s
das-scheduler-6cc59dbf96-4r85f          1/1     Running   0          68s
das-scheduler-6cc59dbf96-bf6ml          1/1     Running   0          68s
```

2. Inspect the logs of the DAS Operator controller by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc logs -n das-operator deployment/das-operator
```

3. Check the logs of the webhook server by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc logs -n das-operator deployment/das-operator-webhook
```

4. Check the logs of the scheduler plugin by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc logs -n das-operator deployment/das-scheduler
```

5. Check the logs of the device plugin daemonset by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc logs -n das-operator daemonset/das-daemonset
```


## Monitoring AllocationClaims

1. Inspect active AllocationClaim resources by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get allocationclaims -n das-operator
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                                                                                           AGE
13950288-57df-4ab5-82bc-6138f646633e-harpatil000034jma-qh5fm-worker-f-57md9-cuda-vectoradd-0   5m
ce997b60-a0b8-4ea4-9107-cf59b425d049-harpatil000034jma-qh5fm-worker-f-fl4wg-cuda-vectoradd-0   5m
```

2. View detailed information about a specific AllocationClaim by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get allocationclaims -n das-operator -o yaml
```

Example output (truncated)

```yaml
apiVersion: inference.redhat.com/v1alpha1
kind: AllocationClaim
metadata:
  name: 13950288-57df-4ab5-82bc-6138f646633e-harpatil000034jma-qh5fm-worker-f-57md9-cuda-vectoradd-0

  nodename: harpatil000034jma-qh5fm-worker-f-57md9
  podRef:
    kind: Pod
    name: cuda-vectoradd-f4b84b678-l2m69
    namespace: default

    message: Allocation is inUse
    reason: inUse
    status: "True"
    type: State
  state: inUse
```

3. Check for claims in different states by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get allocationclaims -n das-operator -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.status.state}{"\n"}{end}'
```

Example output

```terminal
13950288-57df-4ab5-82bc-6138f646633e-harpatil000034jma-qh5fm-worker-f-57md9-cuda-vectoradd-0	inUse
ce997b60-a0b8-4ea4-9107-cf59b425d049-harpatil000034jma-qh5fm-worker-f-fl4wg-cuda-vectoradd-0	inUse
```

4. View events related to AllocationClaim resources by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get events -n das-operator --field-selector involvedObject.kind=AllocationClaim
```

5. Check NodeAccelerator resources to verify GPU hardware detection by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get nodeaccelerator -n das-operator
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                                     AGE
harpatil000034jma-qh5fm-worker-f-57md9   96m
harpatil000034jma-qh5fm-worker-f-fl4wg   96m
```


The NodeAccelerator resources represent the GPU-capable nodes detected by the DAS Operator.

The AllocationClaim custom resource tracks the following information:

GPU UUID:: The unique identifier of the GPU device.
Slice position:: The position of the MIG slice on the GPU.
Pod reference:: The pod that requested the GPU slice.
State:: The current state of the claim (staged, created, or released).

Claims start in the staged state and transition to created when all requests are satisfied. When a pod is deleted, the associated claim is automatically cleaned up.

## Verifying GPU device availability

1. On a node with GPU hardware, verify that CDI devices were created by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc debug node/<node-name>
```


```terminal
sh-4.4# chroot /host
sh-4.4# ls -l /var/run/cdi/
```

2. Check the NVIDIA GPU Operator status by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get clusterpolicies.nvidia.com -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.state}'
```


The output should show ready.

## Increasing log verbosity

To get more detailed debugging information:

1. Edit the DASOperator resource to increase log verbosity by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc edit dasoperator -n das-operator
```

2. Set the operatorLogLevel field to Debug or Trace:

```yaml
spec:
  operatorLogLevel: Debug
```

3. Save the changes and verify that the operator pods restart with increased verbosity.

## Common issues and solutions


[NOTE]
----
Due to kubernetes/kubernetes#128043, pods might enter an UnexpectedAdmissionError state if admission fails. Pods managed by higher level controllers such as Deployments are recreated automatically. Naked pods, however, must be cleaned up manually with oc delete pod. Using controllers is recommended until the upstream issue is resolved.
----

If the DAS Operator fails to start or function properly, verify that all prerequisites are installed:

* Cert-manager
* Node Feature Discovery (NFD) Operator
* NVIDIA GPU Operator

* Kubernetes issue #128043
* Node Feature Discovery Operator
* NVIDIA GPU Operator troubleshooting
