# Exporting applications


As a developer, you can export your application in the ZIP file format. Based on your needs, import the exported application to another project in the same cluster or a different cluster by using the Import YAML option in the +Add view. Exporting your application helps you to reuse your application resources and saves your time.

# Prerequisites

* You have installed the gitops-primer Operator from the OperatorHub.

[NOTE]
----
The Export application option is disabled in the Topology view even after installing the gitops-primer Operator.
----
* You have created an application in the Topology view to enable Export application.

# Procedure

1. In the developer perspective, perform one of the following steps:
1. Navigate to the +Add view and click Export application in the Application portabilityÂ tile.
2. Navigate to the Topology view and click Export application.
2. Click OK in the Export Application dialog box. A notification opens to confirm that the export of resources from your project has started.
3. Optional steps that you might need to perform in the following scenarios:
* If you have started exporting an incorrect application, click  Export application -> Cancel Export.
* If your export is already in progress and you want to start a fresh export, click  Export application -> Restart Export.
* If you want to view logs associated with exporting an application, click  Export application and the View Logs link.
