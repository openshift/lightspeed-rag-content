# Multiarch Tuning Operator release notes


The Multiarch Tuning Operator optimizes workload management within multi-architecture clusters and in single-architecture clusters transitioning to multi-architecture environments.
These release notes track the development of the Multiarch Tuning Operator.

# Release notes for the Multiarch Tuning Operator 1.1.1

Issued: 27 May 2025

## Bug fixes

* Previously, the pod placement operand did not support authenticating registries using wildcard entries in the hostname of their pull secret. This caused inconsistent behavior with Kubelet when pulling images, because Kubelet supported wildcard entries while the operand required exact hostname matches. As a result, image pulls could fail unexpectedly when registries used wildcard hostnames.

With this release, the pod placement operand supports pull secrets that include wildcard hostnames, ensuring consistent and reliable image authentication and pulling.
* Previously, when image inspection failed after all retries and the nodeAffinityScoring plugin was enabled, the pod placement operand applied incorrect nodeAffinityScoring labels.

With this release, the operand sets nodeAffinityScoring labels correctly, even when image inspection fails. It now applies these labels independently of the required affinity process to ensure accurate and consistent scheduling.

# Release notes for the Multiarch Tuning Operator 1.1.0

Issued: 18 March 2024

## New features and enhancements

* The Multiarch Tuning Operator is now supported on managed offerings, including ROSA with Hosted Control Planes (HCP) and other HCP environments.
* With this release, you can configure architecture-aware workload scheduling by using the new plugins field in the ClusterPodPlacementConfig object. You can use the plugins.nodeAffinityScoring field to set architecture preferences for pod placement. If you enable the nodeAffinityScoring plugin, the scheduler first filters out nodes that do not meet the pod requirements. Then, the scheduler prioritizes the remaining nodes based on the architecture scores defined in the nodeAffinityScoring.platforms field.

### Bug fixes

* With this release, the Multiarch Tuning Operator does not update the nodeAffinity field for pods that are managed by a daemon set. (OCPBUGS-45885)

# Release notes for the Multiarch Tuning Operator 1.0.0

Issued: 31 October 2024

## New features and enhancements

* With this release, the Multiarch Tuning Operator supports custom network scenarios and cluster-wide custom registries configurations.
* With this release, you can identify pods based on their architecture compatibility by using the pod labels that the Multiarch Tuning Operator adds to newly created pods.
* With this release, you can monitor the behavior of the Multiarch Tuning Operator by using the metrics and alerts that are registered in the Cluster Monitoring Operator.
