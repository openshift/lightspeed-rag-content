# Gathering data about your cluster update


When reaching out to Red Hat support for issues with an update, it is important to provide data for the support team to use for troubleshooting your failed cluster update.

# Gathering log data for a support case

To gather data from your cluster, including log data, use the oc adm must-gather command. See Gathering data about your cluster.

# Gathering cluster update status using oc adm upgrade status (Technology Preview)

When updating your cluster, the oc adm upgrade command returns returns limited information about the status of your update. You can use the oc adm upgrade status command to decouple status information from the oc adm upgrade command and return specific information regarding a cluster update, including the status of the control plane and worker node updates.

The oc adm upgrade status command is read-only and does not alter any state in your cluster.


[IMPORTANT]
----
{FeatureName} is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
----

The oc adm upgrade status command can be used for clusters from version 4.12 up to the latest supported release.


[NOTE]
----
Your cluster does not need to be a Technology Preview-enabled cluster in order for you to use the oc adm upgrade status command.
----

1. Set the OC_ENABLE_CMD_UPGRADE_STATUS environment variable to true by running the following command:

```terminal
$ export OC_ENABLE_CMD_UPGRADE_STATUS=true
```

2. Run the oc adm upgrade status command:

```terminal
$ oc adm upgrade status
```

# Gathering ClusterVersion history

The Cluster Version Operator (CVO) records updates made to a cluster, known as the ClusterVersion history. The entries can reveal correlation between changes in cluster behavior with potential triggers, although correlation does not imply causation.


[NOTE]
----
The initial, minor, and z-stream version updates are stored by the ClusterVersion history. However, the ClusterVersion history has a size limit. If the limit is reached, the oldest z-stream updates in previous minor versions are pruned to accommodate the limit.
----

You can view the ClusterVersion history by using the {product-title} web console or by using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

## Gathering ClusterVersion history in the {product-title} web console

You can view the ClusterVersion history in the {product-title} web console.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You have access to the {product-title} web console.

* From the web console, click Administration -> Cluster Settings and review the contents of the Details tab.

## Gathering ClusterVersion history using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`)

You can view the ClusterVersion history using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

1. View the cluster update history by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc describe clusterversions/version
```
