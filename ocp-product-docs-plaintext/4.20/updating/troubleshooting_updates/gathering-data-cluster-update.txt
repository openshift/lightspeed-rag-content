# Gathering data about your cluster update


When reaching out to Red Hat support for issues with an update, it is important to provide data for the support team to use for troubleshooting your failed cluster update.

# Gathering log data for a support case

To gather data from your cluster, including log data, use the oc adm must-gather command. See Gathering data about your cluster.

# Changing CVO log level (Technology Preview)


[IMPORTANT]
----
{FeatureName} is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
----

The Cluster Version Operator (CVO) log level verbosity can be changed by the cluster administrator. There are four log levels.

* Normal - The default log level. Contains working log information. Used when everything is fine. Provides helpful notices for auditing or common operations.
* Debug - Used when something goes wrong. Expect a higher quantity of notices.
* Trace - Used to diagnose errors.
* TraceAll - Used to get the complete body content of the logs.


[NOTE]
----
If TraceAll is turned on in a production cluster it may cause widespread performance issues and large log files.
----

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have the TechPreviewNoUpgrade feature set enabled.

1. Enter the following command into the CLI to change the log level.


```terminal
$ oc patch clusterversionoperator/cluster --type=merge --patch '{"spec":{"operatorLogLevel":"<log_level>"}}'
```



```terminal
clusterversionoperator.operator.openshift.io/cluster patched
```


# Gathering ClusterVersion history

The Cluster Version Operator (CVO) records updates made to a cluster, known as the ClusterVersion history. The entries can reveal correlation between changes in cluster behavior with potential triggers, although correlation does not imply causation.


[NOTE]
----
The initial, minor, and z-stream version updates are stored by the ClusterVersion history. However, the ClusterVersion history has a size limit. If the limit is reached, the oldest z-stream updates in previous minor versions are pruned to accommodate the limit.
----

You can view the ClusterVersion history by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console or by using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

## Gathering ClusterVersion history in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console

You can view the ClusterVersion history in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You have access to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

* From the web console, click Administration -> Cluster Settings and review the contents of the Details tab.

## Gathering ClusterVersion history using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`)

You can view the ClusterVersion history using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

1. View the cluster update history by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc describe clusterversions/version
```
