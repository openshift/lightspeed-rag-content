# About disconnected environments


A disconnected environment is an environment that does not have full access to the internet.

# Preferred methods for working with disconnected environments

You can choose between multiple options for most aspects of managing a cluster in a disconnected environment.
For example, when mirroring images you can choose between using the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI (`oc`) plugin or using the oc adm command.

However, some options provide a simpler and more convenient user experience for disconnected environments, and are the preferred method over their alternatives.

Unless your organizational needs require you to choose another option, use the following methods for mirroring images, installing your cluster, and updating your cluster:

* Mirror your images using the oc-mirror plugin v2.
* Install your cluster using the Agent-based Installer.
* Update your cluster using a local OpenShift Update Service instance.
