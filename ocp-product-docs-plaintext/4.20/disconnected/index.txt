# About disconnected installation mirroring


As a cluster administrator, you can use a mirror registry to ensure that your clusters only use container images that satisfy your organizational controls on external content.

# Mirror registries for installing clusters in disconnected environments

You must mirror required container images into a disconnected environment before you can install and provision a cluster there. To mirror those container images, you must have a mirror registry. Consider the following options for creating and using a mirror registry:

* If you already have a container image registry, such as Red Hat Quay, you can use it as your mirror registry. If you do not already have a registry, you must create one.
* After you establish your registry, you need mirroring tools. To mirror your {product-title} image repository to the mirror registry in your disconnected environment, you can use the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI (`oc`) plugin. The oc-mirror plugin is a single tool that mirrors all required {product-title} content and other images to your mirror registry. The oc-mirror plugin is the preferred method for mirroring.
* Alternately, you can use the oc adm command to mirror just release and catalog images for {product-title}.
