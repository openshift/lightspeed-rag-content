# Mirroring images for a disconnected installation by using the oc-mirror plugin v2


You can run your cluster in a disconnected environment if you install the cluster from a mirrored set of {product-title} container images in a private registry. This registry must be running whenever your cluster is running.
You can use oc-mirror plugin v2 to mirror images to a mirror registry in your fully or partially disconnected environments. To download the required images from the official Red Hat registries, you must run oc-mirror plugin v2 from a system with internet connectivity.

# About oc-mirror plugin v2

The oc-mirror OpenShift CLI (oc) plugin is a single tool that mirrors all required {product-title} content and other images to your mirror registry.

To use the new version of oc-mirror, add the --v2 flag to the oc-mirror plugin v2 command line.

oc-mirror plugin v2 has the following features:

* Provides a centralized method to mirror {product-title} releases, Operators, helm charts, and other images.
* Verifies that the complete image set specified in the image set configuration file is mirrored to the mirrored registry, regardless of whether the images were previously mirrored or not.
* Uses a cache system instead of metadata, which prevents the need to start the mirroring process over in the case of a failure for a single step of the process.
* Maintains minimal archive sizes by incorporating only new images into the archive.
* Generates mirroring archives with content selected by mirroring date.
* Can generate ImageDigestMirrorSet (IDMS) and ImageTagMirrorSet (ITMS) resources, which cover the full image set, instead of an ImageContentSourcePolicy (ICSP) resource, which only covered incremental changes to the image set for each mirroring operation with v1.
* Does not perform automatic pruning. v2 now uses a Delete feature, which grants users more control over deleting images.
* Introduces support for registries.conf files. This change facilitates mirroring to multiple enclaves while using the same cache.

## High level workflow

The following steps outline the high-level workflow on how to use the oc-mirror plugin v2 to mirror images to a mirror registry:

1. Create an image set configuration file.
2. Mirror the image set to the target mirror registry by using one of the following workflows:
* Mirror an image set directly to the target mirror registry (mirror to mirror).
* Mirror an image set to disk (mirror to disk), transfer the tar file to the target environment, then mirror the image set to the target mirror registry (disk to mirror).
3. Configure your cluster to use the resources generated by the oc-mirror plugin v2.
4. Repeat these steps to update your target mirror registry as necessary.

## oc-mirror plugin v2 compatibility and support

The oc-mirror plugin v2 is supported for {product-title}.


[NOTE]
----
On aarch64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures the oc-mirror plugin v2 is supported only for {product-title} 4.14 and later.
----

Use the latest available version of the oc-mirror plugin v2 regardless of which versions of {product-title} you need to mirror.

# Prerequisites

* You must have a container image registry that supports Docker V2-2 in the location that hosts the {product-title} cluster, such as Red Hat Quay.

[NOTE]
----
* If you use Red Hat Quay, use version 3.6 or later with the oc-mirror plugin. See Deploying the Red Hat Quay Operator on {product-title} (Red Hat Quay documentation). If you need additional assistance selecting and installing a registry, contact your sales representative or Red Hat Support.
* If you do not have an existing solution for a container image registry, {product-title} subscribers receive a mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift. This mirror registry is included with your subscription and serves as a small-scale container registry. You can use this registry to mirror the necessary container images of {product-title} for disconnected installations.
----
* Every machine in the provisioned clusters must have access to the mirror registry. If the registry is unreachable, tasks like installation, updating, or routine operations such as workload relocation, might fail. Mirror registries must be operated in a highly available manner, ensuring their availability aligns with the production availability of your {product-title} clusters.

# Preparing your mirror hosts

To use the oc-mirror plugin v2 for image mirroring, you must install the plugin and create a file with credentials for container images, enabling you to mirror from Red&#160;Hat to your mirror.

## Installing the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI plugin

Install the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI plugin to manage image sets in disconnected environments.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc). If you are mirroring image sets in a fully disconnected environment, ensure the following:
* You have installed the oc-mirror plugin on the host that has internet access.
* The host in the disconnected environment has access to the target mirror registry.
* You have set the umask parameter to 0022 on the operating system that uses oc-mirror.
* You have installed the correct binary for the RHEL version that you are using.

1. Download the oc-mirror CLI plugin:
1. Navigate to the Downloads page of the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console.
2. In the OpenShift disconnected installation tools section, select the OS type and Architecture type of the OpenShift Client (oc) mirror plugin from the dropdown menus.
3. Click Download to save the file.
2. Extract the archive by running the following command:

```terminal
$ tar xvzf oc-mirror.tar.gz
```

3. If necessary, update the plugin file to be executable by running the following command:

```terminal
$ chmod +x oc-mirror
```


[NOTE]
----
Do not rename the oc-mirror file.
----
4. Install the oc-mirror CLI plugin by placing the file in your PATH, for example /usr/local/bin, by running the following command:

```terminal
$ sudo mv oc-mirror /usr/local/bin/.
```


* Verify that the oc-mirror plugin v2 is successfully installed by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc mirror --v2 --help
```


## Configuring credentials that allow images to be mirrored

Create a container image registry credentials file that enables you to mirror images from Red&#160;Hat to your mirror.


[WARNING]
----
Do not use this image registry credentials file as the pull secret when you install a cluster. If you provide this file when you install cluster, all of the machines in the cluster will have write access to your mirror registry.
----

* You configured a mirror registry to use in your disconnected environment.
* You identified an image repository location on your mirror registry to mirror images into.
* You provisioned a mirror registry account that allows images to be uploaded to that image repository.
* You have write access to the mirror registry.

Complete the following steps on the installation host:

1. Download your registry.redhat.io pull secret from Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager.
2. Make a copy of your pull secret in JSON format by running the following command:

```terminal
$ cat ./pull-secret | jq . > <path>/<pull_secret_file_in_json> 1
```

Specify the path to the folder to store the pull secret in and a name for the JSON file that you create.
Example pull secret

```json
{
  "auths": {
    "cloud.openshift.com": {
      "auth": "b3BlbnNo...",
      "email": "you@example.com"
    },
    "quay.io": {
      "auth": "b3BlbnNo...",
      "email": "you@example.com"
    },
    "registry.connect.redhat.com": {
      "auth": "NTE3Njg5Nj...",
      "email": "you@example.com"
    },
    "registry.redhat.io": {
      "auth": "NTE3Njg5Nj...",
      "email": "you@example.com"
    }
  }
}
```

3. If the $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/containers directory does not exist, create one by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ mkdir -p $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/containers
```

4. Save the pull secret file as $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/containers/auth.json.
5. Generate the base64-encoded user name and password or token for your mirror registry by running the following command:

```terminal
$ echo -n '<user_name>:<password>' | base64 -w0 1
```

For <user_name> and <password>, specify the user name and password that you configured for your registry.
Example output

```terminal
BGVtbYk3ZHAtqXs=
```

6. Edit the JSON file and add a section that describes your registry to it:

```json
  "auths": {
    "<mirror_registry>": { 1
      "auth": "<credentials>", 2
      "email": "you@example.com"
    }
  },
```

Specify the registry domain name, and optionally the port, that your mirror registry uses to serve content. For example,
registry.example.com or registry.example.com:8443
Specify the base64-encoded user name and password for
the mirror registry.
Example modified pull secret

```json
{
  "auths": {
    "registry.example.com": {
      "auth": "BGVtbYk3ZHAtqXs=",
      "email": "you@example.com"
    },
    "cloud.openshift.com": {
      "auth": "b3BlbnNo...",
      "email": "you@example.com"
    },
    "quay.io": {
      "auth": "b3BlbnNo...",
      "email": "you@example.com"
    },
    "registry.connect.redhat.com": {
      "auth": "NTE3Njg5Nj...",
      "email": "you@example.com"
    },
    "registry.redhat.io": {
      "auth": "NTE3Njg5Nj...",
      "email": "you@example.com"
    }
  }
}
```


# Mirroring an image set to a mirror registry

Mirroring an image set to a mirror registry ensures that the required images are available in a secure and controlled environment, facilitating smoother deployments, updates, and maintenance tasks.

## Creating the image set configuration

Before you can use the oc-mirror plugin v2 to mirror images, you must create an image set configuration file.
This image set configuration file defines which {product-title} releases, Operators, and other images to mirror, along with other configuration settings for the oc-mirror plugin v2.

* You have created a container image registry credentials file.
For instructions, see Configuring credentials that allow images to be mirrored.

* Create an ImageSetConfiguration YAML file and modify it to include your required images.
Example ImageSetConfiguration YAML file

```yaml
kind: ImageSetConfiguration
apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v2alpha1
mirror:
  platform:
    channels:
    - name: stable-4.19 1
      minVersion: 4.19.2
      maxVersion: 4.19.2
    graph: true 2
  operators:
    - catalog: registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.19 3
      packages: 4
       - name: aws-load-balancer-operator
       - name: 3scale-operator
       - name: node-observability-operator
  additionalImages: 5
   - name: registry.redhat.io/ubi8/ubi:latest
   - name: registry.redhat.io/ubi9/ubi@sha256:20f695d2a91352d4eaa25107535126727b5945bff38ed36a3e59590f495046f0
```

Set the channel to retrieve {product-title} images from.
Add graph: true to build and push the graph-data image to the mirror registry.
The graph-data image is required to create OpenShift Update Service (OSUS).
The graph: true field also generates the UpdateService custom resource manifest.
The oc command-line interface (CLI) can use the UpdateService custom resource manifest to create OSUS.
For more information, see About the OpenShift Update Service.
Set the Operator catalog to retrieve the {product-title} images from.
Specify only certain Operator packages to include in the image set. Remove this field to retrieve all packages in the catalog.
Specify any additional images to include in image set.

* About the OpenShift Update Service

## Mirroring an image set in a partially disconnected environment

You can mirror image sets to a registry using the oc-mirror plugin v2 in environments with restricted internet access.

* You have access to the internet and the mirror registry in the environment where you are running the oc-mirror plugin v2.

* Mirror the images from the specified image set configuration to a specified registry by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc mirror -c <image_set_configuration> --workspace file://<file_path> docker://<mirror_registry_url> --v2 1
```


where:
<image_set_configuration>:: Specifies the name of the image set configuration file.
<file_path>:: Specifies the directory where cluster resources will be generated in.
<mirror_registry_url>:: Specifies the URL or address of the mirror registry where the images are stored and from which they need to be deleted.

1. Navigate to the working-dir/cluster-resources directory that was generated in the <file_path> directory.
2. Verify that the YAML files are present for the ImageDigestMirrorSet, ImageTagMirrorSet, and CatalogSource resources.

* Configure your cluster to use the resources generated by oc-mirror plugin v2.

## Mirroring an image set in a fully disconnected environment

You can mirror image sets in a fully disconnected environment where the {product-title} cluster cannot access the public internet.
The following high-level workflow describes the mirroring process:

1. Mirror to disk: Mirror the image set to an archive.
2. Disk transfer: Manually transfer the archive to the network of the disconnected mirror registry.
3. Disk to mirror: Mirror the image set from the archive to the target disconnected registry.

### Mirroring from mirror to disk

You can use the oc-mirror plugin v2 to generate an image set and save the content to disk. Afterwards, you can transfer the generated image set to the disconnected environment and mirror it to the target registry.

oc-mirror plugin v2 retrieves the container images from the source specified in the image set configuration file and packs them into a tar archive in a local directory.

* Mirror the images from the specified image set configuration to the disk by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc mirror -c <image_set_configuration> file://<file_path> --v2
```


where:
<image_set_configuration>:: Specifies the name of the image set configuration file.
<file_path>:: Specifies the directory where the archives containing the image sets will be generated in.

1. Navigate to the <file_path> directory that was generated.
2. Verify that the archive files have been generated.

* Mirroring from disk to mirror

### Mirroring from disk to mirror

You can use the oc-mirror plugin v2 to mirror image sets from a disk to a target mirror registry.

The oc-mirror plugin v2 retrieves container images from a local disk and transfers them to the specified mirror registry.

1. Transfer the disk containing mirrored image sets to the environment that contains the target mirror registry.
2. Process the image set file on the disk and mirror the contents to a target mirror registry by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc mirror -c <image_set_configuration> --from file://<file_path> docker://<mirror_registry_url> --v2
```


where:
<image_set_configuration>:: Specifies the name of the image set configuration file.
<file_path>:: Specifies the directory on the disk containing the archives. This folder will also contain cluster resources generated for you apply to the cluster, for example the ImageDigestMirrorSet (IDMS) or ImageTagMirrorSet (ITMS) resources.
<mirror_registry_url>:: Specifies the URL or address of the mirror registry where the images are stored.

1. Navigate to the cluster-resources directory within the working-dir directory that was generated in the <file_path> directory.
2. Verify that the YAML files are present for the ImageDigestMirrorSet, ImageTagMirrorSet, and CatalogSource resources.

* Configure your cluster to use the resources generated by oc-mirror plugin v2.

# About custom resources generated by oc-mirror plugin v2

The oc-mirror plugin v2 automatically generates the following custom resources:

ImageDigestMirrorSet (IDMS):: Handles registry mirror rules when using image digest pull specifications. Generated if at least one image of the image set is mirrored by digest.
ImageTagMirrorSet (ITMS):: Handles registry mirror rules when using image tag pull specifications. Generated if at least one image from the image set is mirrored by tag.
CatalogSource:: Retrieves information about the available Operators in the mirror registry. Used by Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) Classic.
ClusterCatalog:: Retrieves information about the available cluster extensions (which includes Operators) in the mirror registry. Used by OLM v1.
UpdateService:: Provides update graph data to the disconnected environment. Used by the OpenShift Update Service.

* CatalogSource
* ImageDigestMirrorSet
* ImageTagMirrorSet
* About catalogs in OLM v1

## Restrictions on modifying resources that are generated by the oc-mirror plugin

When using resources that are generated by the oc-mirror plugin v2 to configure your cluster, you must not change certain fields. Modifying these fields can cause errors and is not supported.

The following table lists the resources and their fields that must remain unchanged:



For more information about these resources, see the OpenShift API documentation for CatalogSource, ImageDigestMirrorSet, and ImageTagMirrorSet.

## Configuring your cluster to use the resources generated by oc-mirror plugin v2

After you have mirrored your image set to the mirror registry, you must apply the generated ImageDigestMirrorSet (IDMS), ImageTagMirrorSet (ITMS), CatalogSource, and UpdateService resources to the cluster.


[IMPORTANT]
----
In oc-mirror plugin v2, the IDMS and ITMS files cover the entire image set, unlike the ImageContentSourcePolicy (ICSP) files in oc-mirror plugin v1. Therefore, the IDMS and ITMS files contain all images of the set even if you only add new images during incremental mirroring.
----

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

1. Log in to the OpenShift CLI as a user with the cluster-admin role.
2. Apply the YAML files from the results directory to the cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <path_to_oc_mirror_workspace>/working-dir/cluster-resources
```

3. If you mirrored release images, apply the release image signatures to the cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f working-dir/cluster-resources/signature-configmap.json
```


[IMPORTANT]
----
If you are mirroring Operators instead of clusters, do not run the preceding command. Running the command results in an error because there are no release image signatures to apply.
Additionally, a YAML file is available in the same directory working-dir/cluster-resources/. You can use either the JSON or YAML format.
----

1. Verify that the ImageDigestMirrorSet resources are successfully installed by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get imagedigestmirrorset
```


To view only the resources created by oc-mirror, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get imagedigestmirrorset -o jsonpath='{.items[?(@.metadata.annotations.createdBy=="oc-mirror v2")].metadata.name}'
```

2. Verify that the ImageTagMirrorSet resources are successfully installed by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get imagetagmirrorset
```


To view only the resources created by oc-mirror, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get imagetagmirrorset -o jsonpath='{.items[?(@.metadata.annotations.createdBy=="oc-mirror v2")].metadata.name}'
```

3. Verify that the CatalogSource resources are successfully installed by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get catalogsource -n openshift-marketplace
```


To view only the resources created by oc-mirror, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get catalogsource -o jsonpath='{.items[?(@.metadata.annotations.createdBy=="oc-mirror v2")].metadata.name}'
```

4. Verify that the ClusterCatalog resources are successfully installed by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get clustercatalog
```


To view only the resources created by oc-mirror, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get clustercatalog -o jsonpath='{.items[?(@.metadata.annotations.createdBy=="oc-mirror v2")].metadata.name}'
```


After your cluster is configured to use the resources generated by oc-mirror plugin v2, see Next steps for information about tasks that you can perform using your mirrored images.

* Disconnected environment support in OLM v1

# Deletion of images from your disconnected environment

If you have previously deployed images using the oc-mirror plugin v2, you can delete these images to free up space in your mirror registry.
oc-mirror plugin v2 does not automatically prune images that are not included in the ImageSetConfiguration file.
This prevents accidentally deleting necessary or deployed images when making changes to the ImageSetConfig.yaml file.

You must create a DeleteImageSetConfiguration file to specify which images to delete.

In the following example, the DeleteImageSetConfiguration file removes the following images:

* All release images for {product-title} 4.13.3.
* The aws-load-balancer-operator v0.0.1 bundle and all its related images.
* The additional images for ubi and ubi-minimal, referenced by their corresponding digests.


```yaml
apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v2alpha1
kind: DeleteImageSetConfiguration
delete:
  platform:
    channels:
      - name: stable-4.13
        minVersion: 4.13.3
        maxVersion: 4.13.3
  operators:
    - catalog: registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.12
      packages:
      - name: aws-load-balancer-operator
         minVersion: 0.0.1
         maxVersion: 0.0.1
  additionalImages:
    - name: registry.redhat.io/ubi8/ubi@sha256:bce7e9f69fb7d4533447232478fd825811c760288f87a35699f9c8f030f2c1a6
    - name: registry.redhat.io/ubi8/ubi-minimal@sha256:8bedbe742f140108897fb3532068e8316900d9814f399d676ac78b46e740e34e
```



[IMPORTANT]
----
Consider using the mirror-to-disk and disk-to-mirror workflows to reduce deletion issues.
----

oc-mirror plugin v2 deletes only the manifests of the images, which does not reduce the storage occupied in the registry.

To free up storage space from unnecessary images, such as those with deleted manifests, you must enable the garbage collector on your container registry. With the garbage collector enabled, the registry will delete the image blobs that no longer have references to any manifests, reducing the storage previously occupied by the deleted blobs. The process for enabling the garbage collector differs depending on your container registry.

For more information, see "Resolving storage cleanup issues in the distribution registry".


[IMPORTANT]
----
* To skip deleting the Operator catalog image while you are deleting Operator images, you must list the specific Operators under the Operator catalog image in the DeleteImageSetConfiguration file. This ensures that only the specified Operators are deleted, not the catalog image.

If only the Operator catalog image is specified, all Operators within that catalog, as well as the catalog image itself, will be deleted.
* oc-mirror plugin v2 does not delete Operator catalog images automatically because other Operators may still be deployed and depend on these images.

If you are certain that no Operators from a catalog remain in the registry or cluster, you can explicitly add the catalog image to additionalImages in DeleteImageSetConfiguration to remove it.
* Garbage collection behavior depends on the registry. Some registries do not automatically remove deleted images, requiring a system administrator to manually trigger garbage collection to free up space.
----

* Resolving storage cleanup issues in the distribution registry

## Resolving storage cleanup issues in the distribution registry

A known issue in the distribution registry prevents the garbage collector from freeing up storage as expected. This issue does not occur when you use Red Hat Quay.

* Choose the appropriate method to work around the known issue in the distribution registry:
* To restart the container registry, run the following command:

```terminal
$ podman restart <registry_container>
```

* To disable caching in the registry configuration, perform the following steps:
1. To disable the blobdescriptor cache, modify the /etc/docker/registry/config.yml file:

```yaml
version: 0.1
log:
  fields:
    service: registry
storage:
  cache:
    blobdescriptor: ""
  filesystem:
    rootdirectory: /var/lib/registry
http:
  addr: :5000
  headers:
    X-Content-Type-Options: [nosniff]
health:
  storagedriver:
    enabled: true
    interval: 10s
    threshold: 3
```

2. To apply the changes, restart the container registry by running the following command:

```terminal
$ podman restart <registry_container>
```


## Deleting images from a disconnected environment

To delete images from a disconnected environment using the oc-mirror plugin v2, follow the procedure.

* You have enabled garbage collection in your environment to delete images that no longer reference manifests.

1. Create a delete-image-set-config.yaml file and include the following content:
DeleteImageSetConfiguration file

```yaml
apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v2alpha1
kind: DeleteImageSetConfiguration
delete:
  platform:
    channels:
      - name: <channel_name> 1
        minVersion: <channel_min_version> 2
        maxVersion: <channel_max_version> 2
  operators:
    - catalog: <operator_catalog_name> 3
      packages:
      - name: <operator_name> 4
         minVersion: <operator_max_version> 5
         maxVersion: <operator_min_version> 5
  additionalImages:
    - name: <additional_images>
```

Specify the name of the {product-title} channel to delete, for example stable-4.15.
Specify a version range of the images to delete within the channel, for example 4.15.0 for the minimum version and 4.15.1 for the maximum version.
To delete only one version's images, use that version number for both the minVersion and maxVersion fields.
Specify an Operator catalog image containing the Operators to delete, for example registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.14.
The Operator catalog image will not get deleted. Its presence in the registry might be necessary for other Operators still remaining on the cluster.
Specify a specific Operator to delete, for example aws-load-balancer-operator.
Specify a version range of the images to delete for the Operator, for example 0.0.1 for the minimum version and 0.0.2 for the maximum version.
2. Create a delete-images.yaml file by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc mirror delete --config delete-image-set-config.yaml --workspace file://<previously_mirrored_work_folder> --v2 --generate docker://<remote_registry>
```


where:
<previously_mirrored_work_folder>:: Specifies the directory where images were previously mirrored to or stored during the mirroring process.
<remote_registry>:: Specifies the URL or address of the remote container registry from which images will be deleted.

[IMPORTANT]
----
When deleting images, specify the correct workspace directory. Modify or delete the cache directory only when starting mirroring from scratch, such as setting up a new cluster. Incorrect changes to the cache directory might disrupt further mirroring operations.
----
3. Go to the <previously_mirrored_work_folder>/delete directory that was created.
4. Verify that the delete-images.yaml file has been generated.
5. Manually ensure that each image listed in the file is no longer needed by the cluster and can be safely removed from the registry.
6. After you generate the delete-images YAML file, delete the images from the remote registry by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc mirror delete --v2 --delete-yaml-file <previously_mirrored_work_folder>/working-dir/delete/delete-images.yaml docker://<remote_registry>
```


where:
<previously_mirrored_work_folder>:: Specifies the directory where images were previously mirrored or stored during the mirroring process.
<remote_registry>:: Specifies the URL or address of the remote container registry from which images will be deleted.

[IMPORTANT]
----
When using the mirror-to-mirror method to mirror images, images are not cached locally, so you cannot delete images from a local cache.
----

# Verifying your selected images for mirroring

You can use oc-mirror plugin v2 to perform a test run (dry run) that does not actually mirror any images. This enables you to review the list of images that would be mirrored. You can also use a dry run to catch any errors with your image set configuration early. When running a dry run on a mirror-to-disk workflow, the oc-mirror plugin v2 checks if all the images within the image set are available in its cache. Any missing images are listed in the missing.txt file. When a dry run is performed before mirroring, both missing.txt and mapping.txt files contain the same list of images.

## Performing a dry run for oc-mirror plugin v2

Verify your image set configuration by performing a dry run without mirroring any images. This ensures your setup is correct and prevents unintended changes.

* To perform a test run, run the oc mirror command and append the --dry-run argument to the command:

```terminal
$ oc mirror -c <image_set_config_yaml> file://<oc_mirror_workspace_path> --dry-run --v2
```


where:
<image_set_config_yaml>:: Specifies the image set configuration file that you created.
<oc_mirror_workspace_path>:: Insert the address of the workspace path.
<mirror_registry_url>:: Insert the URL or address of the remote container registry from which images will be mirrored or deleted.

1. Navigate to the workspace directory that was generated:

```terminal
$ cd <oc_mirror_workspace_path>
```

2. Review the mapping.txt and missing.txt files that were generated. These files contain a list of all images that would be mirrored.

## Troubleshooting oc-mirror plugin v2 errors

oc-mirror plugin v2 now logs all image mirroring errors in a separate file, making it easier to track and diagnose failures.


[IMPORTANT]
----
When errors occur while mirroring release or release component images, they are critical. This stops the mirroring process immediately.
Errors with mirroring Operators, Operator-related images, or additional images do not stop the mirroring process. Mirroring continues, and oc-mirror plugin v2 saves a file under the working-dir/logs directory describing which Operator failed to mirror.
----

When an image fails to mirror, and that image is mirrored as part of one or more Operator bundles, oc-mirror plugin v2 notifies the user which Operators are incomplete, providing clarity on the Operator bundles affected by the error.

1. Check for server-related issues:
Example error

```terminal
[ERROR]  : [Worker] error mirroring image localhost:55000/openshift/graph-image:latest error: copying image 1/4 from manifest list: trying to reuse blob sha256:edab65b863aead24e3ed77cea194b6562143049a9307cd48f86b542db9eecb6e at destination: pinging container registry localhost:5000: Get "https://localhost:5000/v2/": http: server gave HTTP response to HTTPS client
```

1. Open the mirroring_error_date_time.log file in the  working-dir/logs folder located in the oc-mirror plugin v2 output directory.
2. Look for error messages that typically indicate server-side issues, such as HTTP 500 errors, expired tokens, or timeouts.
3. Retry the mirroring process or contact support if the issue persists.
2. Check for incomplete mirroring of Operators:
Example error

```terminal
error mirroring image docker://registry.redhat.io/3scale-amp2/zync-rhel9@sha256:8bb6b31e108d67476cc62622f20ff8db34efae5d58014de9502336fcc479d86d (Operator bundles: [3scale-operator.v0.11.12] - Operators: [3scale-operator]) error: initializing source docker://localhost:55000/3scale-amp2/zync-rhel9:8bb6b31e108d67476cc62622f20ff8db34efae5d58014de9502336fcc479d86d: reading manifest 8bb6b31e108d67476cc62622f20ff8db34efae5d58014de9502336fcc479d86d in localhost:55000/3scale-amp2/zync-rhel9: manifest unknown

```

1. Check for warnings in the console or log file indicating which Operators are incomplete.

If an Operator is flagged as incomplete, the image related to that Operator likely failed to mirror.
2. Manually mirror the missing image or retry the mirroring process.
3. Check for errors related to generated cluster resources. Even if some images fail to mirror, oc-mirror v2 will still generate cluster resources such as IDMS.yaml and ITMS.yaml files for the successfully mirrored images.
1. Check the output directory for the generated files.
2. If these files are missing for specific images, ensure that no critical errors occurred for those images during the mirroring process.

By following these steps, you can better diagnose issues and ensure smoother mirroring.

# Benefits of enclave support

Enclave support restricts internal access to a specific part of a network. Unlike a demilitarized zone (DMZ) network, which allows inbound and outbound traffic access through firewall boundaries, enclaves do not cross firewall boundaries.

The new enclave support functionality is for scenarios where mirroring is needed for multiple enclaves that are secured behind at least one intermediate disconnected network.

Enclave support has the following benefits:

* You can mirror content for multiple enclaves and centralize it in a single internal registry. Because some customers want to run security checks on the mirrored content, with this setup they can run these checks all at once. The content is then vetted before being mirrored to downstream enclaves.
* You can mirror content directly from the centralized internal registry to enclaves without restarting the mirroring process from the internet for each enclave.
* You can minimize data transfer between network stages, so to ensure that a blob or image is transferred only once from one stage to another.

## Enclave mirroring workflow

![Enclave Support]

The previous image outlines the flow for using the oc-mirror plugin in different environments, including environments with and without an internet connection.

Environment with Internet Connection:

1. The user executes oc-mirror plugin v2 to mirror content from an online registry to a local disk directory.
2. The mirrored content is saved to the disk for transfer to offline environments.

Disconnected Enterprise Environment (No Internet):

* Flow 1:
* The user runs oc-mirror plugin v2 to load the mirrored content from the disk directory, which was transferred from the online environment, into the enterprise-registry.in registry.
* Flow 2:
1. After updating the registries.conf file, the user executes the oc-mirror plugin v2 to mirror content from the enterprise-registry.in registry to an enclave environment.
2. The content is saved to a disk directory for transfer to the enclave.

Enclave Environment (No Internet):

* The user runs oc-mirror plugin v2 to load content from the disk directory into the enclave-registry.in registry.

The image visually represents the data flow across these environments and emphasizes the use of oc-mirror to handle disconnected and enclave environments without an internet connection.

## Mirroring to an enclave

When you mirror to an enclave, you must first transfer the necessary images from one or more enclaves into the enterprise central registry.

The central registry is situated within a secure network, specifically a disconnected environment, and is not directly linked to the public internet. But the user must execute oc mirror in an environment with access to the public internet.

1. Before running oc-mirror plugin v2 in the disconnected environment, create a registries.conf file. The TOML format of the file is described in this specification:

[NOTE]
----
It is recommended to store the file under $HOME/.config/containers/registries.conf or /etc/containers/registries.conf.
----
Example registries.conf

```toml
[[registry]]
location="registry.redhat.io"
[[registry.mirror]]
location="<enterprise-registry.in>"

[[registry]]
location="quay.io"
[[registry.mirror]]
location="<enterprise-registry.in>"
```

2. Generate a mirror archive.
1. To collect all the {product-title} content into an archive on the disk under <file_path>/enterprise-content, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc mirror --v2 -c isc.yaml file://<file_path>/enterprise-content
```

Example of isc.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v2alpha1
kind: ImageSetConfiguration
mirror:
  platform:
    architectures:
      - "amd64"
    channels:
      - name: stable-4.15
        minVersion: 4.15.0
        maxVersion: 4.15.3
```


After the archive is generated, it is transferred to the disconnected environment. The transport mechanism is not part of oc-mirror plugin v2. The enterprise network administrators determine the transfer strategy.

In some cases, the transfer is done manually, in that the disk is physically unplugged from one location, and plugged to another computer in the disconnected environment. In other cases, the Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) or other protocols are used.
3. After the transfer of the archive is done, you can execute oc-mirror plugin v2 again in order to mirror the relevant archive contents to the registry (entrerpise_registry.in in the example) as demonstrated in the following example:

```terminal
$ oc mirror --v2 -c isc.yaml --from file://<disconnected_environment_file_path>/enterprise-content docker://<enterprise_registry.in>/
```


Where:
* --from points to the folder containing the archive. It starts with the file://.
* docker:// is the destination of the mirroring is the final argument. Because it is a docker registry.
* -c (--config) is a mandatory argument. It enables oc-mirror plugin v2 to eventually mirror only sub-parts of the archive to the registry. One archive might contain several {product-title} releases, but the disconnected environment or an enclave might mirror only a few.
4. Prepare the imageSetConfig YAML file, which describes the content to mirror to the enclave:
Example isc-enclave.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v2alpha1
kind: ImageSetConfiguration
mirror:
  platform:
    architectures:
      - "amd64"
    channels:
      - name: stable-4.15
        minVersion: 4.15.2
        maxVersion: 4.15.2
```


You must run oc-mirror plugin v2 on a machine with access to the disconnected registry. In the previous example, the disconnected environment, enterprise-registry.in, is accessible.
5. Update the graph URL

If you are using graph:true, oc-mirror plugin v2 attempts to reach the cincinnati API endpoint. Because this environment is disconnected, be sure to export the environment variable UPDATE_URL_OVERRIDE to refer to the URL for the OpenShift Update Service (OSUS):

```terminal
$ export UPDATE_URL_OVERRIDE=https://<osus.enterprise.in>/graph
```


For more information on setting up OSUS on an OpenShift cluster, see "Updating a cluster in a disconnected environment using the OpenShift Update Service".

[NOTE]
----
When updating between {product-title} Extended Update Support (EUS) versions, you must also include images for an intermediate minor version between the current and target versions.
The oc-mirror plugin v2 might not always detect this requirement automatically, so check the Red Hat {product-title} Update Graph page to confirm any required intermediate versions.
Use the Update Graph page to find the intermediate minor versions suggested by the application, and include any of these versions in the ImageSetConfiguration file when using the oc-mirror plugin v2.
----
6. Generate a mirror archive from the enterprise registry for the enclave.

To prepare an archive for the enclave1, the user executes oc-mirror plugin v2 in the enterprise disconnected environment by using the imageSetConfiguration specific for that enclave. This ensures that only images needed by that enclave are mirrored:

```terminal
$ oc mirror --v2 -c isc-enclave.yaml
file:///disk-enc1/
```


This action collects all the {product-title} content into an archive and generates an archive on disk.
7. After the archive is generated, it will be transferred to the enclave1 network. The transport mechanism is not the responsibility of oc-mirror plugin v2.
8. Mirror contents to the enclave registry

After the transfer of the archive is done, the user can execute oc-mirror plugin v2 again in order to mirror the relevant archive contents to the registry.

```terminal
$ oc mirror --v2 -c isc-enclave.yaml --from file://local-disk docker://registry.enc1.in
```


The administrators of the {product-title} cluster in enclave1 are now ready to install or upgrade that cluster.

# oc-mirror plugin v2 support proxy setting

The oc-mirror plugin v2 can operate in a proxy-configured environment. The plugin can use system proxy settings to retrieve images for {product-title}, Operator catalog, and the additionalImages registry.

* Updating a cluster in a disconnected environment using the OpenShift Update Service
* Resolving storage cleanup issues in the distribution registry

# Mirroring and verifying image signatures in oc-mirror plugin v2

Starting with {product-title} 4.19, the oc-mirror plugin v2 supports mirroring and verifying cosign tag-based signatures for container images.

## Enabling signature mirroring for oc-mirror plugin v2

By default, signature mirroring is disabled. You can enable signature mirroring for all images by setting the --remove-signatures=false flag for the oc mirror command.

When enabled, the oc-mirror plugin v2 mirrors Sigstore tag-based signatures for the following images:

* {product-title} release images
* Operator images
* Additional images
* Helm charts


[NOTE]
----
If you do not provide a configuration file, the oc-mirror plugin v2 enables signature mirroring for all images by default when the --remove-signatures=false flag is used.
To specify a custom configuration directory, use the --registries.d flag.
For more details, see the containers-registries.d(5) manual.
----

1. If you want to enable signature mirroring for all images, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc mirror --remove-signatures=false
```

2. If you want to enable or disable signature mirroring for specific elements, such as transport protocol, registry, namespace or image, use the following steps:
1. Create a YAML file in either the $HOME/.config/containers/registries.d/ or /etc/containers/registries.d/ directory.
2. Specify the use-sigstore-attachments parameter and set it to either true or false under the specific element you want to control, as seen in the following examples:
Example: Disable signature mirroring for the quay.io registry

```yaml
# ...
docker:
  quay.io:
    use-sigstore-attachments: false
# ...
```

Example: Enable signature mirroring for all registries

```yaml
# ...
default-docker:
  use-sigstore-attachments: true
# ...
```


## Enabling signature verification for oc-mirror plugin v2

Starting with {product-title} 4.19, the oc-mirror plugin v2 supports signature verification, which is disabled by default. When enabled, the plugin verifies that container images match their signatures, ensuring they have not been altered and come from trusted sources. If a signature mismatch is detected, the mirroring workflow will fail.

1. If you want to enable signature verification for all images, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc mirror --secure-policy=true
```

2. If you want to enable or disable signature verification for specific elements — such as a transport protocol, registry, namespace, or image — follow these steps:
1. Create a policy.json file in either the $HOME/.config/containers/ or /etc/containers/ directory.

[NOTE]
----
If your policy configuration file is located outside the default directory, you can specify its path by using the --policy flag with the oc mirror command.
For more information, see containers-policy.json(5).
----
2. Define verification rules for the desired scope (for example, registry or image) using the appropriate policy configuration. You can set the verification requirement by specifying the desired rule under each element.
Example: Enable verification for only a specific image, and reject all other images

```json
{
  "default": [{"type": "reject"}],
  "transports": {
    "docker": {
      "hostname:5000/myns/sigstore-signed-image": [
        {
          "type": "sigstoreSigned",
          "keyPath": "/path/to/sigstore-pubkey.pub",
          "signedIdentity": {"type": "matchRepository"}
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```


# How filtering works in the operator catalog

oc-mirror plugin v2 selects the list of bundles for mirroring by processing the information in imageSetConfig.

When oc-mirror plugin v2 selects bundles for mirroring, it does not infer Group Version Kind (GVK) or bundle dependencies, omitting them from the mirroring set. Instead, it strictly adheres to the user instructions. You must explicitly specify any required dependent packages and their versions.



# ImageSet configuration parameters for oc-mirror plugin v2

The oc-mirror plugin v2 requires an image set configuration file that defines what images to mirror. The following table lists the available parameters for the ImageSetConfiguration resource.


[NOTE]
----
Using the minVersion and maxVersion properties to filter for a specific Operator version range can result in a multiple channel heads error. The error message states that there are multiple channel heads. This is because when the filter is applied, the update graph of the Operator is truncated.
OLM requires that every Operator channel contains versions that form an update graph with exactly one end point, that is, the latest version of the Operator. When the filter range is applied, that graph can turn into two or more separate graphs or a graph that has more than one end point.
To avoid this error, do not filter out the latest version of an Operator. If you still run into the error, depending on the Operator, either the maxVersion property must be increased or the minVersion property must be decreased. Because every Operator graph can be different, you might need to adjust these values until the error resolves.
----



## DeleteImageSetConfiguration parameters

To use remove images with the oc-mirror plugin v2, you must use a DeleteImageSetConfiguration.yaml configuration file that defines which images to delete from the mirror registry. The following table lists the available parameters for the DeleteImageSetConfiguration resource.



# Command reference for oc-mirror plugin v2

The following tables describe the oc mirror subcommands and flags for oc-mirror plugin v2:





## Command reference for deleting images

The following tables describe the oc mirror subcommands and flags for deleting images:



## About the --cache-dir and --workspace flags

You can use the --cache-dir flag to specify a directory where the oc-mirror plugin stores a persistent cache of image blobs and manifests for use during mirroring operations.

The oc-mirror plugin uses the cache in the mirror-to-disk and disk-to-mirror workflows but does not use the cache in the mirror-to-mirror workflow. The plugin uses the cache to perform incremental mirroring and avoids remirroring unchanged images, which saves time and reduces network bandwidth usage.

The cache directory only contains data up to the last successful mirroring operation. If you delete or corrupt the cache directory, the oc-mirror plugin pulls the image blobs and manifests again, which can force a full remirror and increase network usage.

You can use the --workspace flag to specify a directory where the oc-mirror plugin stores the working files that it creates during a mirroring operation, such as the ImageDigestMirrorSet and ImageTagMirrorSet manifests. You can also use the workspace directory to perform the following actions:

* Store the untarred metadata for release and operator images.
* Generate tar archives for use in disk-to-mirror workflows.
* Apply the generated configuration to clusters.
* Repeat or resume previous mirroring operations.

If you remove or modify the workspace directory, future mirroring operations might fail, or clusters may use inconsistent image sources.


[WARNING]
----
Deleting or modifying the contents of cache or workspace directories can cause the following issues:
* Failed or incomplete mirroring operations.
* Loss of incremental mirroring data.
* Full remirroring requirements and increased network overhead.
Do not modify, relocate, or delete these directories unless you fully understand the impact. You must regularly back up the cache directory after successful mirroring operations. It is not necessary to back up the workspace directory because its contents are regenerated during each mirroring cycle.
----

Consider the following best practices so that you can better manage the cache and workspace directories effectively:

* Use persistent storage: Place the cache and workspace directories on reliable and backed‑up storage.
* Back up after successful operations: Regularly back up the cache directory, especially after completing a mirroring cycle.
* Restore when needed: In case of data loss, restore the cache and workspace directories from backup to resume mirroring operations without performing a full remirror.
* Separate environments: Use dedicated directories for different environments to prevent conflicts.

Use the following example to specify the cache and workspace directories when running the oc-mirror command:


```terminal
$ oc mirror --config=imageset-config.yaml \
    file://local_mirror \
    --workspace /mnt/mirror-data/workspace \
    --cache-dir /mnt/mirror-data/cache
    --v2
```


After the mirroring operation completes, your directory structure is as follows:


```text
/mnt/mirror-data/
├── cache/
│   ├── manifests/
│   ├── metadata.db
│   └── previous-mirror-state.json
└── workspace/
    ├── imageset-config-state.yaml
    ├── manifests/
    └── icsp/
```


You must back up the /mnt/mirror-data/cache directory after each successful mirroring operation.

* Configuring your cluster to use the resources generated by oc-mirror

# Next steps

After you mirror images to your disconnected environment using oc-mirror plugin v2, you can perform any of the following actions:

* Installing a cluster in a disconnected environment
* Using Operator Lifecycle Manager in disconnected environments
* Updating a cluster in a disconnected environment using the OpenShift Update Service
