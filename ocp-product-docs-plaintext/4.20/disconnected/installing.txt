# Installing a cluster in a disconnected environment


You can install an {product-title} cluster in a disconnected environment, choosing the installation method and infrastructure that best suits your requirements.
This includes installing {product-title} on either on-premise hardware or on a cloud hosting service such as Amazon Web Services (AWS).
The following sections outline all of the supported methods for installing a cluster in a disconnected environment.

[NOTE]
----
In order to learn about other requirements for installing a cluster using a particular method, be sure to review other content in the procedure's respective section of the documentation.
For example, if you plan to install a cluster on AWS with installer-provisioned infrastructure, see Configuring an AWS account and Preparing to install a cluster on AWS
