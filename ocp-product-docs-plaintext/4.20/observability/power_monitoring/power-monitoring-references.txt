# Power monitoring Kepler power attribution guide

Kepler&#8217;s power attribution system provides practical, proportional distribution of hardware energy consumption to individual workloads. While CPU-time-based attribution has inherent limitations due to modern CPU complexity, it offers a good balance between accuracy, simplicity, and performance overhead for most monitoring and optimization use cases.
