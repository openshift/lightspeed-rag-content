# Visualizing power monitoring metrics



[IMPORTANT]
----
Power monitoring is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.

You can visualize power monitoring metrics in the {product-title} web console by accessing power monitoring dashboards or by exploring Metrics under the Observe tab.

# Power monitoring dashboards overview

There are two types of power monitoring dashboards. Both provide different levels of details around power consumption metrics for a single cluster:

## Power Monitor / Overview dashboard

This dashboard allows you to view the following information:

Cluster-wide power consumption:: View current total, active, and idle CPU power consumption, grouped by zones.
Node-level power details:: Analyze historical and current power consumption (total, active, and idle) for individual nodes.
Hardware information:: Display CPU model and core counts for each node in the cluster.
Time-series analysis:: Track power consumption trends over time with graphs that can be filtered by node and zone. This provides a comprehensive view of your cluster's energy usage.

## Power Monitor / Namespace (Pods) dashboard

This dashboard allows you to monitor and analyze power consumption for Kubernetes namespaces and pods. It provides the following information:

Top ten power consuming namespaces:: A real-time table showing the top ten namespaces based on their current power usage. This helps you quickly identify the most resource-intensive workloads.
Total namespace power consumption:: A historical graph showing the total power consumption of pods within a selected namespace over time, grouped by zone. This helps you see trends and understand an application's or service's total power use.
Individual pod power consumption:: A detailed graph showing the power consumption of individual pods, so you can analyze them in detail.

# Accessing power monitoring dashboards as a cluster administrator

You can access power monitoring dashboards of the {product-title} web console.

* You have access to the {product-title} web console.
* You are logged in as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You have installed the Power Monitoring Operator.
* You have deployed Kepler in your cluster.
* You have enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.

1. In the web console, go to Observe -> Dashboards.
2. From the Dashboard drop-down list, select the power monitoring dashboard you want to see:
* Power Monitor / Overview
* Power Monitor / Namespace (Pods)

# Accessing power monitoring dashboards as a developer

You can access power monitoring dashboards from {product-title} web console.

* You have access to the {product-title} web console.
* You have access to the cluster as a developer or as a user.
* You have installed the Power Monitoring Operator.
* You have deployed Kepler in your cluster.
* You have enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You have view permissions for the namespace openshift-power-monitoring, the namespace where Kepler is deployed to.

1. In the web console, go to Observe -> Dashboard.
2. From the Dashboard drop-down list, select the power monitoring dashboard you want to see:
