# New features and enhancements

Network policy to restrict API access:: With this update, the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator creates a network policy for itself and the OpenTelemetry Collector to restrict access to the used APIs.
Native sidecars:: With this update, the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator uses native sidecars on {product-title} 4.16 or later.

# Technology Preview features


[IMPORTANT]
----
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
----

Probabilistic Sampling Processor (Technology Preview):: This release introduces the Probabilistic Sampling Processor as a Technology Preview feature for the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Collector. The Probabilistic Sampling Processor samples a specified percentage of trace spans or log records statelessly and per request. You can use the Probabilistic Sampling Processor if you handle high volumes of telemetry data and seek to reduce costs by reducing processed data volumes.

# Deprecated features

The OpenCensus Receiver is deprecated:: The OpenCensus Receiver, which provided backward compatibility with the OpenCensus format, is deprecated and might be removed in a future release.
The Collector's service metrics telemetry address is deprecated:: The metrics.address field in the OpenTelemetryCollector custom resource (CR) is deprecated and might be removed in a future release. As an alternative, use the metrics.readers field instead.

Example of using the readers field:

```yaml
# ...
  config:
    service:
      telemetry:
        metrics:
          readers:
          - pull:
              exporter:
                prometheus:
                  host: 0.0.0.0
                  port: 8888
# ...
```
