# Logging 6.1



# Logging 6.1.2 Release Notes

This release includes Logging for Red Hat OpenShift Bug Fix Release 6.1.2.

## New Features and Enhancements

* This enhancement adds OTel semantic stream labels to the lokiStack output so that you can query logs by using both ViaQ and OTel stream labels.
(LOG-6579)

## Bug Fixes

* Before this update, the collector alerting rules contained summary and message fields. With this update, the collector alerting rules contain summary and description fields.
(LOG-6126)
* Before this update, the collector metrics dashboard could get removed after an Operator upgrade due to a race condition during the transition from the old to the new pod deployment. With this update, labels are added to the dashboard ConfigMap to identify the upgraded deployment as the current owner so that it will not be removed.
(LOG-6280)
* Before this update, when you included infrastructure namespaces in application inputs, their log_type would be set to application. With this update, the log_type of infrastructure namespaces included in application inputs is set to infrastructure.
(LOG-6373)
* Before this update, the Cluster Logging Operator used a cached client to fetch the SecurityContextConstraint cluster resource, which could result in an error when the cache is invalid. With this update, the Operator now always retrieves data from the API server instead of using a cache.
(LOG-6418)
* Before this update, the logging must-gather did not collect resources such as UIPlugin, ClusterLogForwarder, LogFileMetricExporter, and LokiStack. With this update, the must-gather now collects all of these resources and places them in their respective namespace directory instead of the cluster-logging directory.
(LOG-6422)
* Before this update, the Vector startup script attempted to delete buffer lock files during startup. With this update, the Vector startup script no longer attempts to delete buffer lock files during startup.
(LOG-6506)
* Before this update, the API documentation incorrectly claimed that lokiStack outputs would default the target namespace, which could prevent the collector from writing to that output. With this update, this claim has been removed from the API documentation and the Cluster Logging Operator now validates that a target namespace is present.
(LOG-6573)
* Before this update, the Cluster Logging Operator could deploy the collector with output configurations that were not referenced by any inputs. With this update, a validation check for the ClusterLogForwarder resource prevents the Operator from deploying the collector.
(LOG-6585)

## CVEs

* CVE-2019-12900

# Logging 6.1.1 Release Notes

This release includes Logging for Red Hat OpenShift Bug Fix Release 6.1.1.

## New Features and Enhancements

* With this update, the Loki Operator supports configuring the workload identity federation on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) by using the Cluster Credential Operator (CCO) in {product-title} 4.17 or later. (LOG-6420)

## Bug Fixes

* Before this update, the collector was discarding longer audit log messages with the following error message: Internal log [Found line that exceeds max_line_bytes; discarding.]. With this update, the discarding of longer audit messages is avoided by increasing the audit configuration thresholds: The maximum line size, max_line_bytes, is 3145728 bytes. The maximum number of bytes read during a read cycle, max_read_bytes, is 262144 bytes. (LOG-6379)
* Before this update, an input receiver service was repeatedly created and deleted, causing issues with mounting the TLS secrets. With this update, the service is created once and only deleted if it is not defined in the ClusterLogForwarder custom resource. (LOG-6383)
* Before this update, pipeline validation might have entered an infinite loop if a name was a substring of another name. With this update, stricter name equality checks prevent the infinite loop. (LOG-6405)
* Before this update, the collector alerting rules included the summary and message fields. With this update, the collector alerting rules include the summary and description fields. (LOG-6407)
* Before this update, setting up the custom audit inputs in the ClusterLogForwarder custom resource with configured LokiStack output caused errors due to the nil pointer dereference. With this update, the Operator performs the nil checks, preventing such errors. (LOG-6449)
* Before this update, the ValidLokistackOTLPOutputs condition appeared in the status of the ClusterLogForwarder custom resource even when the output type is not LokiStack. With this update, the ValidLokistackOTLPOutputs condition is removed, and the validation messages for the existing output conditions are corrected. (LOG-6469)
* Before this update, the collector did not correctly mount the /var/log/oauth-server/ path, which prevented the collection of the audit logs. With this update, the volume mount is added, and the audit logs are collected as expected. (LOG-6484)
* Before this update, the must-gather script of the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator might have failed to gather the LokiStack data. With this update, the must-gather script is fixed, and the LokiStack data is gathered reliably. (LOG-6498)
* Before this update, the collector did not correctly mount the oauth-apiserver audit log file. As a result, such audit logs were not collected. With this update, the volume mount is correctly mounted, and the logs are collected as expected. (LOG-6533)

# Logging 6.1.0 Release Notes

This release includes Logging for Red Hat OpenShift Bug Fix Release 6.1.0.

## New Features and Enhancements

### Log Collection

* This enhancement adds the source iostream to the attributes sent from collected container logs. The value is set to either stdout or stderr based on how the collector received it. (LOG-5292)
* With this update, the default memory limit for the collector increases from 1024 Mi to 2048 Mi. Users should adjust resource limits based on their clusterâ€™s specific needs and specifications. (LOG-6072)
* With this update, users can now set the syslog output delivery mode of the ClusterLogForwarder CR to either AtLeastOnce or AtMostOnce. (LOG-6355)

### Log Storage

* With this update, the new 1x.pico LokiStack size supports clusters with fewer workloads and lower log volumes (up to 50GB/day). (LOG-5939)

## Technology Preview


[IMPORTANT]
----
{FeatureName} is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
----

* With this update, OpenTelemetry logs can now be forwarded using the OTel (OpenTelemetry) data model to a Red Hat Managed LokiStack instance. To enable this feature, add the observability.openshift.io/tech-preview-otlp-output: "enabled" annotation to your ClusterLogForwarder configuration. For additional configuration information, see OTLP Forwarding.
* With this update, a dataModel field has been added to the lokiStack output specification. Set the dataModel to Otel to configure log forwarding using the OpenTelemetry data format. The default is set to Viaq. For information about data mapping see OTLP Specification.
