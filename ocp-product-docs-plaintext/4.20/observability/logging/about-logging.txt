# About Logging



As a cluster administrator, you can deploy logging on an {product-title} cluster, and use it to collect and aggregate node system audit logs, application container logs, and infrastructure logs.

You can use logging to perform the following tasks:

* Forward logs to your chosen log outputs, including on-cluster, Red Hat managed log storage.
* Visualize your log data in the {product-title} web console.


[NOTE]
----
Because logging releases on a different cadence from {product-title}, the logging documentation is available as a separate documentation set at Red Hat OpenShift Logging.
