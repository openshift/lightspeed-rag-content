# Troubleshooting the Distributed Tracing Platform


You can diagnose and fix issues in TempoStack or TempoMonolithic instances by using various troubleshooting methods.

# Collecting diagnostic data from the command line

When submitting a support case, it is helpful to include diagnostic information about your cluster to Red Hat Support.
You can use the oc adm must-gather tool to gather diagnostic data for resources of various types, such as TempoStack or TempoMonolithic, and the created resources like Deployment, Pod, or ConfigMap.
The oc adm must-gather tool creates a new pod that collects this data.

* From the directory where you want to save the collected data, run the oc adm must-gather command to collect the data:

```terminal
$ oc adm must-gather --image=ghcr.io/grafana/tempo-operator/must-gather -- \
/usr/bin/must-gather --operator-namespace <operator_namespace> 1
```

The default namespace where the Operator is installed is openshift-tempo-operator.

* Verify that the new directory is created and contains the collected data.
