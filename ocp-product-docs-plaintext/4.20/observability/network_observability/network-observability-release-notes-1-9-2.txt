# Network Observability Operator 1.9.2 advisory

The following advisory is available for the Network Observability Operator 1.9.2:

* RHEA-2025:14150 Network Observability Operator 1.9.2

# Network observability 1.9.2 bug fixes

* Before this update, {product-title} versions 4.15 and earlier did not support the TC_ATTACH_MODE configuration. This led to command-line interface (CLI) errors and prevented the observation of packets and flows. With this release, the Traffic Control eXtension (TCX) hook attachment mode has been adjusted for these older versions. This eliminates tcx hook errors and enables flow and packet observation.
