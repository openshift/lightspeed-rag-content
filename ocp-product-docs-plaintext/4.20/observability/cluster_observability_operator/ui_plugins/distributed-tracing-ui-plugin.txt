# Distributed tracing UI plugin



[IMPORTANT]
----
Starting with {product-title} 4.19, the perspectives in the web console have unified. The Developer perspective is no longer enabled by default.
All users can interact with all {product-title} web console features. However, if you are not the cluster owner, you might need to request permission to access certain features from the cluster owner.
You can still enable the Developer perspective. On the Getting Started pane in the web console, you can take a tour of the console, find information on setting up your cluster, view a quick start for enabling the Developer perspective, and follow links to explore new features and capabilities.
----
The distributed tracing UI plugin adds tracing-related features to the {product-title} web console at Observe -> Traces. You can follow requests through the front end and into the backend of microservices, helping you identify code errors and performance bottlenecks in distributed systems.
