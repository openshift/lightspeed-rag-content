# About Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring



Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform includes a preconfigured, preinstalled, and self-updating monitoring stack that provides monitoring for core platform components. After installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, cluster administrators can optionally enable monitoring for user-defined projects. By using this feature, cluster administrators, developers, and other users can specify how services and pods are monitored in their own projects.


[NOTE]
----
The monitoring stack documentation is available as a separate documentation set at Monitoring stack for Red Hat OpenShift.
