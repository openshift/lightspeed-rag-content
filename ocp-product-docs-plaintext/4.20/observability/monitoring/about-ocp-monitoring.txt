# About {product-title} monitoring



{product-title} includes a preconfigured, preinstalled, and self-updating monitoring stack that provides monitoring for core platform components. After installing {product-title}, cluster administrators can optionally enable monitoring for user-defined projects. By using this feature, cluster administrators, developers, and other users can specify how services and pods are monitored in their own projects.


[NOTE]
----
The monitoring stack documentation is available as a separate documentation set at Monitoring stack for Red Hat OpenShift.
