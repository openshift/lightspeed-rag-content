# User workload monitoring first steps



As a cluster administrator, you can optionally enable monitoring for user-defined projects in addition to core platform monitoring.
Non-administrator users such as developers can then monitor their own projects outside of core platform monitoring.

Cluster administrators typically complete the following activities to configure user-defined projects so that users can view collected metrics, query these metrics, and receive alerts for their own projects:

* Enable user workload monitoring.
* Grant non-administrator users permissions to monitor user-defined projects by assigning the monitoring-rules-view, monitoring-rules-edit, or monitoring-edit cluster roles.
* Assign the user-workload-monitoring-config-edit role to grant non-administrator users permission to configure user-defined projects.
* Enable alert routing for user-defined projects so that developers and other users can configure custom alerts and alert routing for their projects.
* If needed, configure alert routing for user-defined projects to use an optional Alertmanager instance dedicated for use only by user-defined projects.
* Configure notifications for user-defined alerts.
* If you use the platform Alertmanager instance for user-defined alert routing, configure different alert receivers for default platform alerts and user-defined alerts.
