# Developer and non-administrator steps



After monitoring for user-defined projects is enabled and configured, developers and other non-administrator users can then perform the following activities to set up and use monitoring for their own projects:

* Deploy and monitor services.
* Create and manage alerting rules.
* Receive and manage alerts for your projects.
* If granted the alert-routing-edit cluster role, configure alert routing.
* View dashboards by using the {product-title} web console.
* Query the collected metrics by creating PromQL queries or using predefined queries.
