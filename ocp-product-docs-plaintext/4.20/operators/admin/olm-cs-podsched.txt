# Catalog source pod scheduling


When an Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) catalog source of source type grpc defines a spec.image, the Catalog Operator creates a pod that serves the defined image content. By default, this pod defines the following in its specification:
* Only the kubernetes.io/os=linux node selector.
* The default priority class name: system-cluster-critical.
* No tolerations.
As an administrator, you can override these values by modifying fields in the CatalogSource object's optional spec.grpcPodConfig section.

[IMPORTANT]
----
The Marketplace Operator, openshift-marketplace, manages the default OperatorHub custom resource's (CR). This CR manages CatalogSource objects. If you attempt to modify fields in the CatalogSource object's spec.grpcPodConfig section, the Marketplace Operator automatically reverts these modifications. By default, if you modify fields in the spec.grpcPodConfig section of the   CatalogSource object, the Marketplace Operator automatically reverts these changes.
To apply persistent changes to CatalogSource object, you must first disable a default CatalogSource object.

# Disabling default CatalogSource objects at a local level

You can apply persistent changes to a CatalogSource object, such as catalog source pods, at a local level, by disabling a default CatalogSource object. Consider the default configuration in situations where the default CatalogSource object&#8217;s configuration does not meet your organization&#8217;s needs. By default, if you modify fields in the spec.grpcPodConfig section of the   CatalogSource object, the Marketplace Operator automatically reverts these changes.

The Marketplace Operator, openshift-marketplace, manages the default custom resources (CRs) of the OperatorHub. The OperatorHub manages CatalogSource objects.

To apply persistent changes to CatalogSource object, you must first disable a default CatalogSource object.

* To disable all the default CatalogSource objects at a local level, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc patch operatorhub cluster -p '{"spec": {"disableAllDefaultSources": true}}' --type=merge
```


[NOTE]
----
You can also configure the default OperatorHub CR to either disable all CatalogSource objects or disable a specific object.

# Overriding the node selector for catalog source pods

* A CatalogSource object of source type grpc with spec.image is defined.

* Edit the CatalogSource object and add or modify the spec.grpcPodConfig section to include the following:

```yaml
  grpcPodConfig:
    nodeSelector:
      custom_label: <label>
```


where <label> is the label for the node selector that you want catalog source pods to use for scheduling.

* Placing pods on specific nodes using node selectors

# Overriding the priority class name for catalog source pods

* A CatalogSource object of source type grpc with spec.image is defined.

* Edit the CatalogSource object and add or modify the spec.grpcPodConfig section to include the following:

```yaml
  grpcPodConfig:
    priorityClassName: <priority_class>
```


where <priority_class> is one of the following:
* One of the default priority classes provided by Kubernetes: system-cluster-critical or system-node-critical
* An empty set ("") to assign the default priority
* A pre-existing and custom defined priority class


[NOTE]
----
Previously, the only pod scheduling parameter that could be overriden was priorityClassName. This was done by adding the operatorframework.io/priorityclass annotation to the CatalogSource object. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: CatalogSource
metadata:
  name: example-catalog
  namespace: {global_ns}
  annotations:
    operatorframework.io/priorityclass: system-cluster-critical
```

If a CatalogSource object defines both the annotation and spec.grpcPodConfig.priorityClassName, the annotation takes precedence over the configuration parameter.

# Overriding tolerations for catalog source pods

* A CatalogSource object of source type grpc with spec.image is defined.

* Edit the CatalogSource object and add or modify the spec.grpcPodConfig section to include the following:

```yaml
  grpcPodConfig:
    tolerations:
      - key: "<key_name>"
        operator: "<operator_type>"
        value: "<value>"
        effect: "<effect>"
```
