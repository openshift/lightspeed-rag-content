# Viewing Operator status


Understanding the state of the system in Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) is important for making decisions about and debugging problems with installed Operators. OLM provides insight into subscriptions and related catalog sources regarding their state and actions performed. This helps users better understand the healthiness of their Operators.

# Operator subscription condition types

Subscriptions can report the following condition types:




[NOTE]
----
Default {product-title} cluster Operators are managed by the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) and they do not have a Subscription object. Application Operators are managed by Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) and they have a Subscription object.

* Refreshing failing subscriptions

# Viewing Operator subscription status by using the CLI

You can view Operator subscription status by using the CLI.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. List Operator subscriptions:

```terminal
$ oc get subs -n <operator_namespace>
```

2. Use the oc describe command to inspect a Subscription resource:

```terminal
$ oc describe sub <subscription_name> -n <operator_namespace>
```

3. In the command output, find the Conditions section for the status of Operator subscription condition types. In the following example, the CatalogSourcesUnhealthy condition type has a status of false because all available catalog sources are healthy:
Example output

```terminal
Name:         cluster-logging
Namespace:    openshift-logging
Labels:       operators.coreos.com/cluster-logging.openshift-logging=
Annotations:  <none>
API Version:  operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
Kind:         Subscription
# ...
Conditions:
   Last Transition Time:  2019-07-29T13:42:57Z
   Message:               all available catalogsources are healthy
   Reason:                AllCatalogSourcesHealthy
   Status:                False
   Type:                  CatalogSourcesUnhealthy
# ...
```

Default {product-title} cluster Operators are managed by the Cluster Version Operator (CVO) and they do not have a Subscription object. Application Operators are managed by Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) and they have a Subscription object.

# Viewing Operator catalog source status by using the CLI

You can view the status of an Operator catalog source by using the CLI.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. List the catalog sources in a namespace. For example, you can check the {global_ns} namespace, which is used for cluster-wide catalog sources:

```terminal
$ oc get catalogsources -n {global_ns}
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                  DISPLAY               TYPE   PUBLISHER   AGE
certified-operators   Certified Operators   grpc   Red Hat     55m
community-operators   Community Operators   grpc   Red Hat     55m
example-catalog       Example Catalog       grpc   Example Org 2m25s
redhat-operators      Red Hat Operators     grpc   Red Hat     55m
```

2. Use the oc describe command to get more details and status about a catalog source:

```terminal
$ oc describe catalogsource example-catalog -n {global_ns}
```

Example output

```terminal
Name:         example-catalog
Namespace:    {global_ns}
Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  operatorframework.io/managed-by: marketplace-operator
              target.workload.openshift.io/management: {"effect": "PreferredDuringScheduling"}
API Version:  operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
Kind:         CatalogSource
# ...
Status:
  Connection State:
    Address:              example-catalog.{global_ns}.svc:50051
    Last Connect:         2021-09-09T17:07:35Z
    Last Observed State:  TRANSIENT_FAILURE
  Registry Service:
    Created At:         2021-09-09T17:05:45Z
    Port:               50051
    Protocol:           grpc
    Service Name:       example-catalog
    Service Namespace:  {global_ns}
# ...
```


In the preceding example output, the last observed state is TRANSIENT_FAILURE. This state indicates that there is a problem establishing a connection for the catalog source.
3. List the pods in the namespace where your catalog source was created:

```terminal
$ oc get pods -n {global_ns}
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                                    READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
certified-operators-cv9nn               1/1     Running            0          36m
community-operators-6v8lp               1/1     Running            0          36m
marketplace-operator-86bfc75f9b-jkgbc   1/1     Running            0          42m
example-catalog-bwt8z                   0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0          3m55s
redhat-operators-smxx8                  1/1     Running            0          36m
```


When a catalog source is created in a namespace, a pod for the catalog source is created in that namespace. In the preceding example output, the status for the example-catalog-bwt8z pod is ImagePullBackOff. This status indicates that there is an issue pulling the catalog source&#8217;s index image.
4. Use the oc describe command to inspect a pod for more detailed information:

```terminal
$ oc describe pod example-catalog-bwt8z -n {global_ns}
```

Example output

```terminal
Name:         example-catalog-bwt8z
Namespace:    {global_ns}
Priority:     0
Node:         ci-ln-jyryyg2-f76d1-ggdbq-worker-b-vsxjd/10.0.128.2

  Warning  Failed          8s (x3 over 47s)   kubelet            Error: ErrImagePull
```


In the preceding example output, the error messages indicate that the catalog source&#8217;s index image is failing to pull successfully because of an authorization issue. For example, the index image might be stored in a registry that requires login credentials.
