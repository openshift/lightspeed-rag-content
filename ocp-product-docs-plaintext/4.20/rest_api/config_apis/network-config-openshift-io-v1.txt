# Network [config.openshift.io/v1]


Description:: 
Network holds cluster-wide information about Network. The canonical name is cluster. It is used to configure the desired network configuration, such as: IP address pools for services/pod IPs, network plugin, etc.
Please view network.spec for an explanation on what applies when configuring this resource.
Compatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).

Required:: 
* spec

# Specification



## .spec

Description:: 
spec holds user settable values for configuration.
As a general rule, this SHOULD NOT be read directly. Instead, you should
consume the NetworkStatus, as it indicates the currently deployed configuration.
Currently, most spec fields are immutable after installation. Please view the individual ones for further details on each.
Type:: object



## .spec.clusterNetwork

Description:: 
IP address pool to use for pod IPs.
This field is immutable after installation.
Type:: array

## .spec.clusterNetwork[]

Description:: 
ClusterNetworkEntry is a contiguous block of IP addresses from which pod IPs
are allocated.
Type:: object



## .spec.externalIP

Description:: 
externalIP defines configuration for controllers that
affect Service.ExternalIP. If nil, then ExternalIP is
not allowed to be set.
Type:: object



## .spec.externalIP.policy

Description:: 
policy is a set of restrictions applied to the ExternalIP field.
If nil or empty, then ExternalIP is not allowed to be set.
Type:: object



## .spec.networkDiagnostics

Description:: 
networkDiagnostics defines network diagnostics configuration.
Takes precedence over spec.disableNetworkDiagnostics in network.operator.openshift.io.
If networkDiagnostics is not specified or is empty,
and the spec.disableNetworkDiagnostics flag in network.operator.openshift.io is set to true,
the network diagnostics feature will be disabled.
Type:: object



## .spec.networkDiagnostics.sourcePlacement

Description:: 
sourcePlacement controls the scheduling of network diagnostics source deployment
See NetworkDiagnosticsSourcePlacement for more details about default values.
Type:: object



## .spec.networkDiagnostics.sourcePlacement.tolerations

Description:: 
tolerations is a list of tolerations applied to network diagnostics components
When omitted, this means the user has no opinion and the platform is left
to choose reasonable defaults. These defaults are subject to change over time.
The current default is an empty list.
Type:: array

## .spec.networkDiagnostics.sourcePlacement.tolerations[]

Description:: 
The pod this Toleration is attached to tolerates any taint that matches
the triple <key,value,effect> using the matching operator <operator>.
Type:: object



## .spec.networkDiagnostics.targetPlacement

Description:: 
targetPlacement controls the scheduling of network diagnostics target daemonset
See NetworkDiagnosticsTargetPlacement for more details about default values.
Type:: object



## .spec.networkDiagnostics.targetPlacement.tolerations

Description:: 
tolerations is a list of tolerations applied to network diagnostics components
When omitted, this means the user has no opinion and the platform is left
to choose reasonable defaults. These defaults are subject to change over time.
The current default is - operator: "Exists" which means that all taints are tolerated.
Type:: array

## .spec.networkDiagnostics.targetPlacement.tolerations[]

Description:: 
The pod this Toleration is attached to tolerates any taint that matches
the triple <key,value,effect> using the matching operator <operator>.
Type:: object



## .status

Description:: 
status holds observed values from the cluster. They may not be overridden.
Type:: object



## .status.clusterNetwork

Description:: 
IP address pool to use for pod IPs.
Type:: array

## .status.clusterNetwork[]

Description:: 
ClusterNetworkEntry is a contiguous block of IP addresses from which pod IPs
are allocated.
Type:: object



## .status.conditions

Description:: 
conditions represents the observations of a network.config current state.
Known .status.conditions.type are: "NetworkDiagnosticsAvailable"
Type:: array

## .status.conditions[]

Description:: 
Condition contains details for one aspect of the current state of this API Resource.
Type:: object
Required:: 
* lastTransitionTime
* message
* reason
* status
* type



## .status.migration

Description:: 
migration contains the cluster network migration configuration.
Type:: object



## .status.migration.mtu

Description:: 
mtu is the MTU configuration that is being deployed.
Type:: object



## .status.migration.mtu.machine

Description:: 
machine contains MTU migration configuration for the machine's uplink.
Type:: object



## .status.migration.mtu.network

Description:: 
network contains MTU migration configuration for the default network.
Type:: object
