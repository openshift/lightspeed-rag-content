# ClusterCatalog [olm.operatorframework.io/v1]


Description:: 
ClusterCatalog enables users to make File-Based Catalog (FBC) catalog data available to the cluster.
For more information on FBC, see https://olm.operatorframework.io/docs/reference/file-based-catalogs/#docs
Type:: object
Required:: 
* metadata
* spec

# Specification



## .spec

Description:: 
spec is the desired state of the ClusterCatalog.
spec is required.
The controller will work to ensure that the desired
catalog is unpacked and served over the catalog content HTTP server.
Type:: object
Required:: 
* source



## .spec.source

Description:: 
source allows a user to define the source of a catalog.
A "catalog" contains information on content that can be installed on a cluster.
Providing a catalog source makes the contents of the catalog discoverable and usable by
other on-cluster components.
These on-cluster components may do a variety of things with this information, such as
presenting the content in a GUI dashboard or installing content from the catalog on the cluster.
The catalog source must contain catalog metadata in the File-Based Catalog (FBC) format.
For more information on FBC, see https://olm.operatorframework.io/docs/reference/file-based-catalogs/#docs.
source is a required field.
Below is a minimal example of a ClusterCatalogSpec that sources a catalog from an image:
source:
  type: Image
  image:
    ref: quay.io/operatorhubio/catalog:latest
Type:: object
Required:: 
* type



## .spec.source.image

Description:: 
image is used to configure how catalog contents are sourced from an OCI image.
This field is required when type is Image, and forbidden otherwise.
Type:: object
Required:: 
* ref



## .status

Description:: 
status contains information about the state of the ClusterCatalog such as:
  - Whether or not the catalog contents are being served via the catalog content HTTP server
  - Whether or not the ClusterCatalog is progressing to a new state
  - A reference to the source from which the catalog contents were retrieved
Type:: object



## .status.conditions

Description:: 
conditions is a representation of the current state for this ClusterCatalog.
The current condition types are Serving and Progressing.
The Serving condition is used to represent whether or not the contents of the catalog is being served via the HTTP(S) web server.
When it has a status of True and a reason of Available, the contents of the catalog are being served.
When it has a status of False and a reason of Unavailable, the contents of the catalog are not being served because the contents are not yet available.
When it has a status of False and a reason of UserSpecifiedUnavailable, the contents of the catalog are not being served because the catalog has been intentionally marked as unavailable.
The Progressing condition is used to represent whether or not the ClusterCatalog is progressing or is ready to progress towards a new state.
When it has a status of True and a reason of Retrying, there was an error in the progression of the ClusterCatalog that may be resolved on subsequent reconciliation attempts.
When it has a status of True and a reason of Succeeded, the ClusterCatalog has successfully progressed to a new state and is ready to continue progressing.
When it has a status of False and a reason of Blocked, there was an error in the progression of the ClusterCatalog that requires manual intervention for recovery.
In the case that the Serving condition is True with reason Available and Progressing is True with reason Retrying, the previously fetched
catalog contents are still being served via the HTTP(S) web server while we are progressing towards serving a new version of the catalog
contents. This could occur when we've initially fetched the latest contents from the source for this catalog and when polling for changes
to the contents we identify that there are updates to the contents.
Type:: array

## .status.conditions[]

Description:: 
Condition contains details for one aspect of the current state of this API Resource.
Type:: object
Required:: 
* lastTransitionTime
* message
* reason
* status
* type



## .status.resolvedSource

Description:: 
resolvedSource contains information about the resolved source based on the source type.
Type:: object
Required:: 
* image
* type



## .status.resolvedSource.image

Description:: 
image is a field containing resolution information for a catalog sourced from an image.
This field must be set when type is Image, and forbidden otherwise.
Type:: object
Required:: 
* ref



## .status.urls

Description:: 
urls contains the URLs that can be used to access the catalog.
Type:: object
Required:: 
* base
