# Specification



## .spec

Description:: 
Specification of the desired behavior of BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy.
Type:: object
Required::

## .spec.egress

Description:: 
Egress is the list of Egress rules to be applied to the selected pods if
they are not matched by any AdminNetworkPolicy or NetworkPolicy rules.
A total of 100 Egress rules will be allowed in each BANP instance.
The relative precedence of egress rules within a single BANP object
will be determined by the order in which the rule is written.
Thus, a rule that appears at the top of the egress rules
would take the highest precedence.
BANPs with no egress rules do not affect egress traffic.

set of traffic originating from pods selected by a BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy's
Subject field.
