# GatewayClass [gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1]


Description:: 
GatewayClass describes a class of Gateways available to the user for creating
Gateway resources.
It is recommended that this resource be used as a template for Gateways. This
means that a Gateway is based on the state of the GatewayClass at the time it
was created and changes to the GatewayClass or associated parameters are not
propagated down to existing Gateways. This recommendation is intended to
limit the blast radius of changes to GatewayClass or associated parameters.
If implementations choose to propagate GatewayClass changes to existing
Gateways, that MUST be clearly documented by the implementation.
Whenever one or more Gateways are using a GatewayClass, implementations SHOULD
add the gateway-exists-finalizer.gateway.networking.k8s.io finalizer on the
associated GatewayClass. This ensures that a GatewayClass associated with a
Gateway is not deleted while in use.
GatewayClass is a Cluster level resource.
Type:: object
Required:: 
* spec

# Specification



## .spec

Description:: 
Spec defines the desired state of GatewayClass.
Type:: object
Required:: 
* controllerName



## .spec.parametersRef

Description:: 
ParametersRef is a reference to a resource that contains the configuration
parameters corresponding to the GatewayClass. This is optional if the
controller does not require any additional configuration.
ParametersRef can reference a standard Kubernetes resource, i.e. ConfigMap,
or an implementation-specific custom resource. The resource can be
cluster-scoped or namespace-scoped.
If the referent cannot be found, refers to an unsupported kind, or when
the data within that resource is malformed, the GatewayClass SHOULD be
rejected with the "Accepted" status condition set to "False" and an
"InvalidParameters" reason.
A Gateway for this GatewayClass may provide its own parametersRef. When both are specified,
the merging behavior is implementation specific.
It is generally recommended that GatewayClass provides defaults that can be overridden by a Gateway.
Support: Implementation-specific
Type:: object
Required:: 
* group
* kind
* name



## .status

Description:: 
Status defines the current state of GatewayClass.
Implementations MUST populate status on all GatewayClass resources which
specify their controller name.
Type:: object



## .status.conditions

Description:: 
Conditions is the current status from the controller for
this GatewayClass.
Controllers should prefer to publish conditions using values
of GatewayClassConditionType for the type of each Condition.
Type:: array

## .status.conditions[]

Description:: 
Condition contains details for one aspect of the current state of this API Resource.
Type:: object
Required:: 
* lastTransitionTime
* message
* reason
* status
* type
