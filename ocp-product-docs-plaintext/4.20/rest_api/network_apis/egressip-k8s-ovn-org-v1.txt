Description:: 
matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed.
Type:: array

## .spec.namespaceSelector.matchExpressions[]

A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that relates the key and values.
Type:: object

The list of assigned egress IPs and their corresponding node assignment.
Type:: array

## .status.items[]

Description::
