# Installing the hosted control planes command-line interface


The hosted control planes command-line interface, hcp, is a tool that you can use to get started with hosted control planes. For Day 2 operations, such as management and configuration, use GitOps or your own automation tool.

# Installing the hosted control planes command-line interface from the terminal

You can install the hosted control planes command-line interface (CLI), hcp, from the terminal.

* On an {product-title} cluster, you have installed multicluster engine for Kubernetes Operator 2.5 or later. The multicluster engine Operator is automatically installed when you install Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management. You can also install multicluster engine Operator without Red Hat Advanced Management as an Operator from {product-title} OperatorHub.

1. Get the URL to download the hcp binary by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get ConsoleCLIDownload hcp-cli-download -o json | jq -r ".spec"
```

2. Download the hcp binary by running the following command:

```terminal
$ wget <hcp_cli_download_url> 1
```

Replace hcp_cli_download_url with the URL that you obtained from the previous step.
3. Unpack the downloaded archive by running the following command:

```terminal
$ tar xvzf hcp.tar.gz
```

4. Make the hcp binary file executable by running the following command:

```terminal
$ chmod +x hcp
```

5. Move the hcp binary file to a directory in your path by running the following command:

```terminal
$ sudo mv hcp /usr/local/bin/.
```



[NOTE]
----
If you download the CLI on a Mac computer, you might see a warning about the hcp binary file. You need to adjust your security settings to allow the binary file to be run.
----

* Verify that you see the list of available parameters by running the following command:

```terminal
$ hcp create cluster <platform> --help 1
```

You can use the hcp create cluster command to create and manage hosted clusters. The supported platforms are aws, agent, and kubevirt.
