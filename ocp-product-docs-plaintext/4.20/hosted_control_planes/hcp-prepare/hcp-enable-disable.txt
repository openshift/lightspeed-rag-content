# Enabling or disabling the hosted control planes feature


The hosted control planes feature, as well as the hypershift-addon managed cluster add-on, are enabled by default. If you want to disable the feature, or if you disabled it and want to manually enable it, see the following procedures.

# Manually enabling the hosted control planes feature

If you need to manually enable hosted control planes, complete the following steps.

1. Run the following command to enable the feature:

```terminal
$ oc patch mce multiclusterengine --type=merge -p \
  '{"spec":{"overrides":{"components":[{"name":"hypershift","enabled": true}]}}}' 1
```

The default MultiClusterEngine resource instance name is multiclusterengine, but you can get the MultiClusterEngine name from your cluster by running the following command: $ oc get mce.
2. Run the following command to verify that the hypershift and hypershift-local-hosting features are enabled in the MultiClusterEngine custom resource:

```terminal
$ oc get mce multiclusterengine -o yaml 1
```

The default MultiClusterEngine resource instance name is multiclusterengine, but you can get the MultiClusterEngine name from your cluster by running the following command: $ oc get mce.
Example output

```yaml
apiVersion: multicluster.openshift.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterEngine
metadata:
  name: multiclusterengine
spec:
  overrides:
    components:
    - name: hypershift
      enabled: true
    - name: hypershift-local-hosting
      enabled: true
```


## Manually enabling the hypershift-addon managed cluster add-on for local-cluster

Enabling the hosted control planes feature automatically enables the hypershift-addon managed cluster add-on. If you need to enable the hypershift-addon managed cluster add-on manually, complete the following steps to use the hypershift-addon to install the HyperShift Operator on local-cluster.

1. Create the ManagedClusterAddon add-on named hypershift-addon by creating a file that resembles the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: addon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: ManagedClusterAddOn
metadata:
  name: hypershift-addon
  namespace: local-cluster
spec:
  installNamespace: open-cluster-management-agent-addon
```

2. Apply the file by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <filename>
```


Replace filename with the name of the file that you created.
3. Confirm that the hypershift-addon managed cluster add-on is installed by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get managedclusteraddons -n local-cluster hypershift-addon
```


If the add-on is installed, the output resembles the following example:

```terminal
NAME               AVAILABLE   DEGRADED   PROGRESSING
hypershift-addon   True
```


Your hypershift-addon managed cluster add-on is installed and the hosting cluster is available to create and manage hosted clusters.

# Disabling the hosted control planes feature

You can uninstall the HyperShift Operator and disable the hosted control planes feature. When you disable the hosted control planes feature, you must destroy the hosted cluster and the managed cluster resource on multicluster engine Operator, as described in the Managing hosted clusters topics.

## Uninstalling the HyperShift Operator

To uninstall the HyperShift Operator and disable the hypershift-addon from the local-cluster, complete the following steps:

1. Run the following command to ensure that there is no hosted cluster running:

```terminal
$ oc get hostedcluster -A
```


[IMPORTANT]
----
If a hosted cluster is running, the HyperShift Operator does not uninstall, even if the hypershift-addon is disabled.
----
2. Disable the hypershift-addon by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc patch mce multiclusterengine --type=merge -p \1
  '{"spec":{"overrides":{"components":[{"name":"hypershift-local-hosting","enabled": false}]}}}'
```

The default MultiClusterEngine resource instance name is multiclusterengine, but you can get the MultiClusterEngine name from your cluster by running the following command: $ oc get mce.

[NOTE]
----
You can also disable the hypershift-addon for the local-cluster from the multicluster engine Operator console after disabling the hypershift-addon.
----

## Disabling the hosted control planes feature

To disable the hosted control planes feature, complete the following steps.

* You uninstalled the HyperShift Operator. For more information, see "Uninstalling the HyperShift Operator".

1. Run the following command to disable the hosted control planes feature:

```terminal
$ oc patch mce multiclusterengine --type=merge -p \1
  '{"spec":{"overrides":{"components":[{"name":"hypershift","enabled": false}]}}}'
```

The default MultiClusterEngine resource instance name is multiclusterengine, but you can get the MultiClusterEngine name from your cluster by running the following command: $ oc get mce.
2. You can verify that the hypershift and hypershift-local-hosting features are disabled in the MultiClusterEngine custom resource by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get mce multiclusterengine -o yaml 1
```

The default MultiClusterEngine resource instance name is multiclusterengine, but you can get the MultiClusterEngine name from your cluster by running the following command: $ oc get mce.

See the following example where hypershift and hypershift-local-hosting have their enabled: flags set to false:

```yaml
apiVersion: multicluster.openshift.io/v1
kind: MultiClusterEngine
metadata:
  name: multiclusterengine
spec:
  overrides:
    components:
    - name: hypershift
      enabled: false
    - name: hypershift-local-hosting
      enabled: false
```
