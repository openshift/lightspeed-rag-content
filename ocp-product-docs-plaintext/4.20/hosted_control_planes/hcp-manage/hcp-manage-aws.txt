# Managing hosted control planes on AWS


When you use hosted control planes for {product-title} on Amazon Web Services (AWS), the infrastructure requirements vary based on your setup.

# Prerequisites to manage AWS infrastructure and IAM permissions

To configure hosted control planes for {product-title} on Amazon Web Services (AWS), you must meet the following the infrastructure requirements:

* You configured hosted control planes before you can create hosted clusters.
* You created an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role and AWS Security Token Service (STS) credentials.

## Infrastructure requirements for AWS

When you use hosted control planes on Amazon Web Services (AWS), the infrastructure requirements fit in the following categories:

* Prerequired and unmanaged infrastructure for the HyperShift Operator in an arbitrary AWS account
* Prerequired and unmanaged infrastructure in a hosted cluster AWS account
* Hosted control planes-managed infrastructure in a management AWS account
* Hosted control planes-managed infrastructure in a hosted cluster AWS account
* Kubernetes-managed infrastructure in a hosted cluster AWS account

Prerequired means that hosted control planes requires AWS infrastructure to properly work. Unmanaged means that no Operator or controller creates the infrastructure for you.

## Unmanaged infrastructure for the HyperShift Operator in an AWS account

An arbitrary Amazon Web Services (AWS) account depends on the provider of the hosted control planes service.

In self-managed hosted control planes, the cluster service provider controls the AWS account. The cluster service provider is the administrator who hosts cluster control planes and is responsible for uptime. In managed hosted control planes, the AWS account belongs to Red Hat.

In a prerequired and unmanaged infrastructure for the HyperShift Operator, the following infrastructure requirements apply for a management cluster AWS account:

* One S3 Bucket
* OpenID Connect (OIDC)
* Route 53 hosted zones
* A domain to host private and public entries for hosted clusters

## Unmanaged infrastructure requirements for a management AWS account

When your infrastructure is prerequired and unmanaged in a hosted cluster Amazon Web Services (AWS) account, the infrastructure requirements for all access modes are as follows:

* One VPC
* One DHCP Option
* Two subnets
* A private subnet that is an internal data plane subnet
* A public subnet that enables access to the internet from the data plane
* One internet gateway
* One elastic IP
* One NAT gateway
* One security group (worker nodes)
* Two route tables (one private and one public)
* Two Route 53 hosted zones
* Enough quota for the following items:
* One Ingress service load balancer for public hosted clusters
* One private link endpoint for private hosted clusters


[NOTE]
----
For private link networking to work, the endpoint zone in the hosted cluster AWS account must match the zone of the instance that is resolved by the service endpoint in the management cluster AWS account. In AWS, the zone names are aliases, such as us-east-2b, which do not necessarily map to the same zone in different accounts. As a result, for private link to work, the management cluster must have subnets or workers in all zones of its region.
----

## Infrastructure requirements for a management AWS account

When your infrastructure is managed by hosted control planes in a management AWS account, the infrastructure requirements differ depending on whether your clusters are public, private, or a combination.

For accounts with public clusters, the infrastructure requirements are as follows:

* Network load balancer: a load balancer Kube API server
* Kubernetes creates a security group
* Volumes
* For etcd (one or three depending on high availability)
* For OVN-Kube

For accounts with private clusters, the infrastructure requirements are as follows:

* Network load balancer: a load balancer private router
* Endpoint service (private link)

For accounts with public and private clusters, the infrastructure requirements are as follows:

* Network load balancer: a load balancer public router
* Network load balancer: a load balancer private router
* Endpoint service (private link)
* Volumes
* For etcd (one or three depending on high availability)
* For OVN-Kube

## Infrastructure requirements for an AWS account in a hosted cluster

When your infrastructure is managed by hosted control planes in a hosted cluster Amazon Web Services (AWS) account, the infrastructure requirements differ depending on whether your clusters are public, private, or a combination.

For accounts with public clusters, the infrastructure requirements are as follows:

* Node pools must have EC2 instances that have Role and RolePolicy defined.

For accounts with private clusters, the infrastructure requirements are as follows:

* One private link endpoint for each availability zone
* EC2 instances for node pools

For accounts with public and private clusters, the infrastructure requirements are as follows:

* One private link endpoint for each availability zone
* EC2 instances for node pools

## Kubernetes-managed infrastructure in a hosted cluster AWS account

When Kubernetes manages your infrastructure in a hosted cluster Amazon Web Services (AWS) account, the infrastructure requirements are as follows:

* A network load balancer for default Ingress
* An S3 bucket for registry

# Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions

In the context of hosted control planes, the consumer is responsible to create the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) roles. The consumer is an automated process to generate the permissions files. The consumer might be the CLI or OpenShift Cluster Manager. Hosted control planes can enable granularity to honor the principle of least-privilege components, which means that every component uses its own role to operate or create Amazon Web Services (AWS) objects, and the roles are limited to what is required for the product to function normally.

The hosted cluster receives the ARN roles as input and the consumer creates an AWS permission configuration for each component. As a result, the component can authenticate through STS and preconfigured OIDC IDP.

The following roles are consumed by some of the components from hosted control planes that run on the control plane and operate on the data plane:

* controlPlaneOperatorARN
* imageRegistryARN
* ingressARN
* kubeCloudControllerARN
* nodePoolManagementARN
* storageARN
* networkARN

The following example shows a reference to the IAM roles from the hosted cluster:


```yaml
...
endpointAccess: Public
  region: us-east-2
  resourceTags:
  - key: kubernetes.io/cluster/example-cluster-bz4j5
    value: owned
rolesRef:
    controlPlaneOperatorARN: arn:aws:iam::820196288204:role/example-cluster-bz4j5-control-plane-operator
    imageRegistryARN: arn:aws:iam::820196288204:role/example-cluster-bz4j5-openshift-image-registry
    ingressARN: arn:aws:iam::820196288204:role/example-cluster-bz4j5-openshift-ingress

# Creating AWS infrastructure and IAM resources separate

By default, the hcp create cluster aws command creates cloud infrastructure with the hosted cluster and applies it. You can create the cloud infrastructure portion separately so that you can use the hcp create cluster aws command only to create the cluster, or render it to modify it before you apply it.

To create the cloud infrastructure portion separately, you need to create the Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure, create the AWS Identity and Access (IAM) resources, and create the cluster.

## Creating the AWS infrastructure separately

To create the Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure, you need to create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and other resources for your cluster. You can use the AWS console or an infrastructure automation and provisioning tool. For instructions to use the AWS console, see Create a VPC plus other VPC resources in the AWS Documentation.

The VPC must include private and public subnets and resources for external access, such as a network address translation (NAT) gateway and an internet gateway. In addition to the VPC, you need a private hosted zone for the ingress of your cluster. If you are creating clusters that use PrivateLink (Private or PublicAndPrivate access modes), you need an additional hosted zone for PrivateLink.

Create the AWS infrastructure for your hosted cluster by using the following example configuration:

Replace <pull_secret_name> with the name of your pull secret.
Replace <etcd_encryption_key_name> with the name of your etcd encryption key.
Replace <ssh_key_name> with the name of your SSH key.
Replace <hosted_cluster_name> with the name of your hosted cluster.
Replace <dns_domain> with your base DNS domain, such as example.com.
Replace <infra_id> with the value that identifies the IAM resources that are associated with the hosted cluster.
Replace <issuer_url> with your issuer URL, which ends with your infra_id value. For example, https://example-hosted-us-west-1.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/example-hosted-infra-id.
Replace <subnet_xxx> with your subnet ID. Both private and public subnets need to be tagged. For public subnets, use kubernetes.io/role/elb=1. For private subnets, use kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb=1.
Replace <vpc_xxx> with your VPC ID.
Replace <node_pool_name> with the name of your NodePool resource.
Replace <instance_profile_name> with the name of your AWS instance.

## Creating the AWS IAM resources

In Amazon Web Services (AWS), you must create the following IAM resources:

* An OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider in IAM, which is required to enable STS authentication.
* Seven roles, which are separate for every component that interacts with the provider, such as the Kubernetes controller manager, cluster API provider, and registry
* The instance profile, which is the profile that is assigned to all worker instances of the cluster

## Creating a hosted cluster separately

You can create a hosted cluster separately on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

To create a hosted cluster separately, enter the following command:


```terminal
$ hcp create cluster aws \
    --infra-id <infra_id> \1
    --name <hosted_cluster_name> \2
    --sts-creds <path_to_sts_credential_file> \3
    --pull-secret <path_to_pull_secret> \4
    --generate-ssh \5
    --node-pool-replicas 3
    --role-arn <role_name> 6
```


Replace <infra_id> with the same ID that you specified in the create infra aws command. This value identifies the IAM resources that are associated with the hosted cluster.
Replace <hosted_cluster_name> with the name of your hosted cluster.
Replace <path_to_sts_credential_file> with the same name that you specified in the create infra aws command.
Replace <path_to_pull_secret> with the name of the file that contains a valid {product-title} pull secret.
The --generate-ssh flag is optional, but is good to include in case you need to SSH to your workers. An SSH key is generated for you and is stored as a secret in the same namespace as the hosted cluster.
Replace <role_name> with the Amazon Resource Name (ARN), for example, arn:aws:iam::820196288204:role/myrole. Specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN), for example, arn:aws:iam::820196288204:role/myrole. For more information about ARN roles, see "Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions".

You can also add the --render flag to the command and redirect output to a file where you can edit the resources before you apply them to the cluster.

After you run the command, the following resources are applied to your cluster:

* A namespace
* A secret with your pull secret
* A HostedCluster
* A NodePool
* Three AWS STS secrets for control plane components
* One SSH key secret if you specified the --generate-ssh flag.

# Transitioning a hosted cluster from single-architecture to multi-architecture

You can transition your single-architecture 64-bit AMD hosted cluster to a multi-architecture hosted cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS), to reduce the cost of running workloads on your cluster. For example, you can run existing workloads on 64-bit AMD while transitioning to 64-bit ARM and you can manage these workloads from a central Kubernetes cluster.

A single-architecture hosted cluster can manage node pools of only one particular CPU architecture. However, a multi-architecture hosted cluster can manage node pools with different CPU architectures. On AWS, a multi-architecture hosted cluster can manage both 64-bit AMD and 64-bit ARM node pools.

* You have installed an {product-title} management cluster for AWS on Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) with the multicluster engine for Kubernetes Operator.
* You have an existing single-architecture hosted cluster that uses 64-bit AMD variant of the {product-title} release payload.
* An existing node pool that uses the same 64-bit AMD variant of the {product-title} release payload and is managed by an existing hosted cluster.
* Ensure that you installed the following command-line tools:
* oc
* kubectl
* hcp
* skopeo

1. Review an existing {product-title} release image of the single-architecture hosted cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get hostedcluster/<hosted_cluster_name> \1
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.release.image}'
```

Replace <hosted_cluster_name> with your hosted cluster name.
Example output

```terminal
quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:<4.y.z>-x86_64 1
```

Replace <4.y.z> with the supported {product-title} version that you use.
2. In your {product-title} release image, if you use the digest instead of a tag, find the multi-architecture tag version of your release image:
1. Set the OCP_VERSION environment variable for the {product-title} version by running the following command:

```terminal
$ OCP_VERSION=$(oc image info quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release@sha256:ac78ebf77f95ab8ff52847ecd22592b545415e1ff6c7ff7f66bf81f158ae4f5e \
  -o jsonpath='{.config.config.Labels["io.openshift.release"]}')
```

2. Set the MULTI_ARCH_TAG environment variable for the multi-architecture tag version of your release image by running the following command:

```terminal
$ MULTI_ARCH_TAG=$(skopeo inspect docker://quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release@sha256:ac78ebf77f95ab8ff52847ecd22592b545415e1ff6c7ff7f66bf81f158ae4f5e \
  | jq -r '.RepoTags' | sed 's/"//g' | sed 's/,//g' \
  | grep -w "$OCP_VERSION-multi$" | xargs)
```

3. Set the IMAGE environment variable for the multi-architecture release image name by running the following command:

```terminal
$ IMAGE=quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:$MULTI_ARCH_TAG
```

4. To see the list of multi-architecture image digests, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc image info $IMAGE
```

Example output

```terminal
OS            DIGEST
linux/amd64   sha256:b4c7a91802c09a5a748fe19ddd99a8ffab52d8a31db3a081a956a87f22a22ff8

```

3. Transition the hosted cluster from single-architecture to multi-architecture:
1. Set the multi-architecture {product-title} release image for the hosted cluster by ensuring that you use the same {product-title} version as the hosted cluster. Run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc patch -n clusters hostedclusters/<hosted_cluster_name> -p \
  '{"spec":{"release":{"image":"quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:<4.x.y>-multi"}}}' \1
  --type=merge
```

Replace <4.y.z> with the supported {product-title} version that you use.
2. Confirm that the multi-architecture image is set in your hosted cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get hostedcluster/<hosted_cluster_name> \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.release.image}'
```

4. Check that the status of the HostedControlPlane resource is Progressing by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get hostedcontrolplane -n <hosted_control_plane_namespace> -oyaml
```

Example output

```yaml
#...
  - lastTransitionTime: "2024-07-28T13:07:18Z"
    message: HostedCluster is deploying, upgrading, or reconfiguring
    observedGeneration: 5
    reason: Progressing
    status: "True"
    type: Progressing
#...
```

5. Check that the status of the HostedCluster resource is Progressing by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get hostedcluster <hosted_cluster_name> \
  -n <hosted_cluster_namespace> -oyaml
```


* Verify that a node pool is using the multi-architecture release image in your HostedControlPlane resource by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get hostedcontrolplane -n clusters-example -oyaml
```

Example output

```yaml
#...
version:
    availableUpdates: null
    desired:
      image: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:<4.x.y>-multi 1
      url: https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2024:4855
      version: 4.16.5
    history:
    - completionTime: "2024-07-28T13:10:58Z"
      image: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:<4.x.y>-multi
      startedTime: "2024-07-28T13:10:27Z"
      state: Completed
      verified: false
      version: <4.x.y>
```

Replace <4.y.z> with the supported {product-title} version that you use.

[NOTE]
----
The multi-architecture {product-title} release image is updated in your HostedCluster, HostedControlPlane resources, and hosted control plane pods. However, your existing node pools do not transition with the multi-architecture image automatically, because the release image transition is decoupled between the hosted cluster and node pools. You must create new node pools on your new multi-architecture hosted cluster.
----

* Creating node pools on the multi-architecture hosted cluster

# Creating node pools on the multi-architecture hosted cluster

After transitioning your hosted cluster from single-architecture to multi-architecture, create node pools on compute machines based on 64-bit AMD and 64-bit ARM architectures.

1. Create node pools based on 64-bit ARM architecture by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ hcp create nodepool aws \
  --cluster-name <hosted_cluster_name> \1
  --name <nodepool_name> \2
  --node-count=<node_count> \3
  --arch arm64
```

Replace <hosted_cluster_name> with your hosted cluster name.
Replace <nodepool_name> with your node pool name.
Replace <node_count> with integer for your node count, for example, 2.
2. Create node pools based on 64-bit AMD architecture by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ hcp create nodepool aws \
  --cluster-name <hosted_cluster_name> \1
  --name <nodepool_name> \2
  --node-count=<node_count> \3
  --arch amd64
```

Replace <hosted_cluster_name> with your hosted cluster name.
Replace <nodepool_name> with your node pool name.
Replace <node_count> with integer for your node count, for example, 2.

* Verify that a node pool is using the multi-architecture release image by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get nodepool/<nodepool_name> -oyaml
```

Example output for 64-bit AMD node pools

```yaml
#...
spec:
  arch: amd64
#...
  release:
    image: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:<4.x.y>-multi 1
```

Replace <4.y.z> with the supported {product-title} version that you use.
Example output for 64-bit ARM node pools

```yaml
#...
spec:
  arch: arm64
#...
  release:
    image: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:<4.x.y>-multi
```


# Adding or updating AWS tags for a hosted cluster

As a cluster instance administrator, you can add or update Amazon Web Services (AWS) tags without needing to re-create your hosted cluster. Tags are key-value pairs that are attached to AWS resources for management and automation.

You might want to use tags for the following purposes:

* Managing access controls.
* Tracking chargeback or showback.
* Managing cloud IAM conditional permissions.
* Aggregating resources based on tags. For example, you can query tags to calculate resource usage and billing costs.

You can add or update tags for several different types of resources, including EFS access points, load balancer resources, Amazon EBS volumes, IAM users, and AWS S3.


[IMPORTANT]
----
On network load balancers, tags cannot be added or updated. The AWS load balancer reconciles whatever tags are in the HostedCluster resource. If you try to add or update a tag, the load balancer overwrites the tag.
In addition, tags cannot be updated on the default security group resource that is created directly by hosted control planes.
----

* You must have cluster administrator permissions for your hosted cluster on AWS.

1. If you want to add or update tags for EFS access points, complete steps 1 and 2. If you are adding or updating tags for other types of resources, complete only step 2.
1. In the aws-efs-csi-driver-operator service account, add two annotations, as shown in the following example. These annotations are required so that the AWS EKS pod identity webhook that runs on the cluster can correctly assign AWS roles to the pods that the EFS Operator uses.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: <service_account_name>
  namespace: <project_name>
  annotations:
    eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn:<role_arn>
    eks.amazonaws.com/audience:sts.amazonaws.com
```

2. Delete the Operator pod or roll out a restart of the aws-efs-csi-driver-operator deployment.
2. In the HostedCluster resource, enter information in the resourceTags fields, as shown in the following example:
Example HostedCluster resource

```yaml
apiVersion: hypershift.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: HostedCluster
metadata:
  #...
spec:
  autoscaling: {}
  clusterID: <cluster_id>
  configuration: {}
  controllerAvailabilityPolicy: SingleReplica
  dns:
    #...
  etcd:
    #...
  fips: false
  infraID: <infra_id>
  infrastructureAvailabilityPolicy: SingleReplica
  issuerURL: https://<issuer_url>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com
  networking:
    #...
  olmCatalogPlacement: management
  platform:
    aws:
      #...
      resourceTags:
      - key: kubernetes.io/cluster/<tag> 1
        value: owned
      rolesRef:
        #...
    type: AWS
```


Specify the tag that you want to add to your resource.

# Configuring node pool capacity blocks on AWS

After creating a hosted cluster, you can configure node pool capacity blocks for graphics processing unit (GPU) reservations on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

1. Create GPU reservations on AWS by running the following command:

[IMPORTANT]
----
The zone of the GPU reservation must match your hosted cluster zone.
----

```terminal
$ aws ec2 describe-capacity-block-offerings \
      --instance-type "p4d.24xlarge"\ 1
      --instance-count  "1" \ 2
      --start-date-range "$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")"  \ 3
      --end-date-range "$(date -u -d "2 day" +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")" \ 4
      --capacity-duration-hours 24 \ 5
      --output json
```

Defines the type of your AWS instance, for example, p4d.24xlarge.
Defines your instance purchase quantity, for example, 1. Valid values are integers ranging from 1 to 64.
Defines the start date range, for example, 2025-07-21T10:14:39Z.
Defines the end date range, for example, 2025-07-22T10:16:36Z.
Defines the duration of capacity blocks in hours, for example, 24.
2. Purchase the minimum fee capacity block by running the following command:

```terminal
$ aws ec2 purchase-capacity-block \
      --capacity-block-offering-id "${MIN_FEE_ID}" \ 1
      --instance-platform "Linux/UNIX"\ 2
      --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=capacity-reservation,Tags=[{Key=usage-cluster-type,Value=hypershift-hosted}]' \ 3
      --output json   > "${CR_OUTPUT_FILE}"
```

Defines the ID of the capacity block offering.
Defines the platform of your instance.
Defines the tag for your instance.
3. Create an environment variable to set the capacity reservation ID by running the following command:

```terminal
$ CB_RESERVATION_ID=$(jq -r '.CapacityReservation.CapacityReservationId' "${CR_OUTPUT_FILE}")
```


Wait for a couple of minutes for the GPU reservation to become available.
4. Add a node pool to use the GPU reservation by running the following command:

```terminal
$ hcp create nodepool aws \
  --cluster-name <hosted_cluster_name> \ 1
  --name <node_pool_name> \ 2
  --node-count 1 \ 3
  --instance-type p4d.24xlarge \ 4
  --arch amd64 \ 5
  --release-image <release_image> \ 6
  --render > /tmp/np.yaml
```

Replace <hosted_cluster_name> with the name of your hosted cluster.
Replace <node_pool_name> with the name of your node pool.
Defines the node pool count, for example, 1.
Defines the instance type, for example, p4d.24xlarge.
Defines an architecture type, for example, amd64.
Replace <release_image> with the release image you want to use.
5. Add the capacityReservation setting in your NodePool resource by using the following example configuration:

```yaml
# ...
spec:
  arch: amd64
  clusterName: cb-np-hcp
  management:
    autoRepair: false
    upgradeType: Replace
  platform:
    aws:
      instanceProfile: cb-np-hcp-dqppw-worker
      instanceType: p4d.24xlarge
      rootVolume:
        size: 120
        type: gp3
      subnet:
        id: subnet-00000
      placement:
        capacityReservation:
          id: ${CB_RESERVATION_ID}
          marketType: CapacityBlocks
    type: AWS
# ...
```

6. Apply the node pool configuration by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f /tmp/np.yaml
```


1. Verify that your new node pool is created successfully by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get np -n clusters
```

Example output

```terminal
NAMESPACE   NAME    CLUSTER     DESIRED NODES   CURRENT  NODES   AUTOSCALING     AUTOREPAIR   VERSION                               UPDATINGVERSION   UPDATINGCONFIG   MESSAGE
clusters    cb-np   cb-np-hcp   1               1                False           False        4.20.0-0.nightly-2025-06-05-224220    False             False
```

2. Verify that your new compute nodes are created in the hosted cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get nodes
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                           STATUS   ROLES    AGE    VERSION
ip-10-0-132-74.ec2.internal    Ready    worker   17m    v1.33.4
ip-10-0-134-183.ec2.internal   Ready    worker   4h5m   v1.33.4
```


## Destroying a hosted cluster after configuring node pool capacity blocks

After you configured node pool capacity blocks, you can optionally destroy a hosted cluster and uninstall the HyperShift Operator.

1. To destroy a hosted cluster, run the following example command:

```terminal
$ hcp destroy cluster aws \
  --name cb-np-hcp \
  --aws-creds $HOME/.aws/credentials \
  --namespace clusters \
  --region us-east-2
```

2. To uninstall the HyperShift Operator, run the following command:

```terminal
$ hcp install render --format=yaml | oc delete -f -
```
