# Destroying a hosted cluster on bare metal


You can destroy hosted clusters on bare metal by using the command-line interface (CLI) or the multicluster engine Operator web console.

# Destroying a hosted cluster on bare metal by using the CLI

If you created a hosted cluster by using the command-line interface (CLI), you can destroy that hosted cluster and its back-end resources by running a command.

* Delete the hosted cluster and its back-end resources by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete -f <hosted_cluster_config>.yaml 1
```

Specify the name of the configuration YAML file that was rendered when you created the hosted cluster.

[NOTE]
----
If you created the hosted cluster without specifying the --render and --render-sensitive flags in its configuration file, you must remove its back-end resources manually.
