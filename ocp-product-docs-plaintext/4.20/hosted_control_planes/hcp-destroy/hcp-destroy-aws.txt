# Destroying a hosted cluster on AWS by using the CLI

You can use the command-line interface (CLI) to destroy a hosted cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

1. Delete the managed cluster resource on multicluster engine Operator by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete managedcluster <hosted_cluster_name> 1
```

Replace <hosted_cluster_name> with the name of your cluster.
2. Delete the hosted cluster and its backend resources by running the following command:

```terminal
$ hcp destroy cluster aws  \
  --name <hosted_cluster_name> \1
  --infra-id <infra_id> \2
  --role-arn <arn_role> \3
  --sts-creds <path_to_sts_credential_file> \4
  --base-domain <basedomain> 5
```

Specify the name of your hosted cluster, for instance, example.
Specify the infrastructure name for your hosted cluster.
Specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN), for example, arn:aws:iam::820196288204:role/myrole.
Specify the path to your AWS Security Token Service (STS) credentials file, for example, /home/user/sts-creds/sts-creds.json.
Specify your base domain, for example, example.com.

$ aws sts get-session-token --output json > sts-creds.json
