# Destroying a hosted cluster by using the CLI

You can destroy a hosted cluster and its associated resources on Red&#160;Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) by using the hcp CLI tool.

* You installed the hosted control planes CLI, hcp.

* To destroy the cluster and its associated resources, run the following command:

```terminal
$ hcp destroy cluster openstack --name=<cluster_name>
```


where:
<cluster_name>:: is the name of the hosted cluster.

After the process completes, all your cluster and all resources that are associated with it are destroyed.
