# About high availability for hosted control planes


You can maintain high availability (HA) of hosted control planes by implementing the following actions:
* Recover etcd members for a hosted cluster.
* Back up and restore etcd for a hosted cluster.
* Perform a disaster recovery process for a hosted cluster.

# Impact of the failed management cluster component

If the management cluster component fails, your workload remains unaffected. In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform management cluster, the control plane is decoupled from the data plane to provide resiliency.

The following table covers the impact of a failed management cluster component on the control plane and the data plane. However, the table does not cover all scenarios for the management cluster component failures.
