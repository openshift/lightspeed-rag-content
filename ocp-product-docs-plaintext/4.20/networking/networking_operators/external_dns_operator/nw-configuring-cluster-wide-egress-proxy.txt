# Configuring the cluster-wide proxy on the External DNS Operator


After configuring the cluster-wide proxy, the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) triggers automatic updates to all of the deployed Operators with the new contents of the HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, and NO_PROXY environment variables.

# Trusting the certificate authority of the cluster-wide proxy

You can configure the External DNS Operator to trust the certificate authority of the cluster-wide proxy.

1. Create the config map to contain the CA bundle in the external-dns-operator namespace by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n external-dns-operator create configmap trusted-ca
```

2. To inject the trusted CA bundle into the config map, add the config.openshift.io/inject-trusted-cabundle=true label to the config map by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n external-dns-operator label cm trusted-ca config.openshift.io/inject-trusted-cabundle=true
```

3. Update the subscription of the External DNS Operator by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n external-dns-operator patch subscription external-dns-operator --type='json' -p='[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/config", "value":{"env":[{"name":"TRUSTED_CA_CONFIGMAP_NAME","value":"trusted-ca"}]}}]'
```


* After the deployment of the External DNS Operator is completed, verify that the trusted CA environment variable is added, outputted as trusted-ca, to the external-dns-operator deployment by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n external-dns-operator exec deploy/external-dns-operator -c external-dns-operator -- printenv TRUSTED_CA_CONFIGMAP_NAME
```
