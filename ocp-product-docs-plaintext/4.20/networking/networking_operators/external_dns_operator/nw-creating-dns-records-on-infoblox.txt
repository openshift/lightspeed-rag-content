You can create DNS records on Infoblox by using the External DNS Operator.

# Creating DNS records on a public DNS zone on Infoblox

You can create DNS records on a public DNS zone on Infoblox by using the External DNS Operator.

* You have access to the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have access to the Infoblox UI.

1. Create a secret object with Infoblox credentials by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n external-dns-operator create secret generic infoblox-credentials --from-literal=EXTERNAL_DNS_INFOBLOX_WAPI_USERNAME=<infoblox_username> --from-literal=EXTERNAL_DNS_INFOBLOX_WAPI_PASSWORD=<infoblox_password>
```

2. Get a list of routes by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get routes --all-namespaces | grep console
```

Example Output

```terminal
openshift-console          console             console-openshift-console.apps.test.example.com                       console             https   reencrypt/Redirect     None
openshift-console          downloads           downloads-openshift-console.apps.test.example.com                     downloads           http    edge/Redirect          None
```

3. Create a YAML file, for example, external-dns-sample-infoblox.yaml, that defines the ExternalDNS object:
Example external-dns-sample-infoblox.yaml file

```yaml
apiVersion: externaldns.olm.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: ExternalDNS
metadata:
  name: sample-infoblox 1
spec:
  provider:
    type: Infoblox 2
    infoblox:
      credentials:
        name: infoblox-credentials
      gridHost: ${INFOBLOX_GRID_PUBLIC_IP}
      wapiPort: 443
      wapiVersion: "2.3.1"
  domains:
  - filterType: Include
    matchType: Exact
    name: test.example.com
  source:
    type: OpenShiftRoute 3
    openshiftRouteOptions:
      routerName: default 4
```

Specifies the External DNS name.
Defines the provider type.
You can define options for the source of DNS records.
If the source type is OpenShiftRoute, you can pass the OpenShift Ingress Controller name. External DNS selects the canonical hostname of that router as the target while creating CNAME record.
4. Create the ExternalDNS resource on Infoblox by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f external-dns-sample-infoblox.yaml
```

5. From the Infoblox UI, check the DNS records created for console routes:
1. Click Data Management -> DNS -> Zones.
2. Select the zone name.
