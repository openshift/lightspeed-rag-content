# Upgrading the MetalLB Operator


A Subscription custom resource (CR) that subscribes the namespace to metallb-system by default, automatically sets the installPlanApproval parameter to Automatic. This means that when Red Hat-provided Operator catalogs include a newer version of the MetalLB Operator, the MetalLB Operator is automatically upgraded.
If you need to manually control upgrading the MetalLB Operator, set the installPlanApproval parameter to Manual.

# Manually upgrading the MetalLB Operator

To manually control upgrading the MetalLB Operator, you must edit the Subscription custom resource (CR) that subscribes the namespace to metallb-system. A Subscription CR is created as part of the Operator installation and the CR has the installPlanApproval parameter set to Automatic by default.

* You updated your cluster to the latest z-stream release.
* You used OperatorHub to install the MetalLB Operator.
* Access the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

1. Get the YAML definition of the metallb-operator subscription in the metallb-system namespace by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n metallb-system get subscription metallb-operator -o yaml
```

2. Edit the Subscription CR by setting the installPlanApproval parameter to Manual:

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: metallb-operator
  namespace: metallb-system
# ...
spec:
   channel: stable
   installPlanApproval: Manual
   name: metallb-operator
   source: redhat-operators
   sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
# ...
```

3. Find the latest {product-title} {product-version} version of the MetalLB Operator by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n metallb-system get csv
```

4. Check the install plan that exists in the namespace by entering the following command.

```terminal
$ oc -n metallb-system get installplan
```

Example output that shows install-tsz2g as a manual install plan

```terminal
NAME            CSV                                     APPROVAL    APPROVED
install-shpmd   metallb-operator.v{product-version}.0-202502261233   Automatic   true
install-tsz2g   metallb-operator.v{product-version}.0-202503102139   Manual      false
```

5. Edit the install plan that exists in the namespace by entering the following command. Ensure that you replace <name_of_installplan> with the name of the install plan, such as install-tsz2g.

```terminal
$ oc edit installplan <name_of_installplan> -n metallb-system
```

1. With the install plan open in your editor, set the spec.approval parameter to Manual and set the spec.approved parameter to true.

[NOTE]
----
After you edit the install plan, the upgrade operation starts. If you enter the oc -n metallb-system get csv command during the upgrade operation, the output might show the Replacing or the Pending status.
----

* To verify that the Operator is upgraded, enter the following command and then check that output shows Succeeded for the Operator:

```terminal
$ oc -n metallb-system get csv
```
