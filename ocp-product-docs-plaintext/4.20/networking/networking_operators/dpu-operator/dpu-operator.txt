# Orchestrating DPUs with the DPU Operator

You can use the Data Processing Unit (DPU) Operator to manage DPUs that offload networking, storage, and security workloads from host CPUs to improve cluster performance and efficiency.

A DPU is a type of programmable processor that represents one of the three fundamental pillars of computing, alongside CPUs and GPUs. While CPUs handle general computing tasks and GPUs accelerate specific workloads, the primary role of the DPU is to offload and accelerate data-centric workloads, such as networking, storage, and security functions.

DPUs are typically used in data centers and cloud environments to improve performance, reduce latency, and enhance security by offloading these tasks from the CPU. You can also use DPUs to create a more efficient and flexible infrastructure by enabling the deployment of specialized workloads closer to the data source.

The DPU Operator is responsible for managing the DPU devices and network attachments. The DPU Operator deploys the DPU daemon onto Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform compute nodes that interface through an API controlling the DPU daemon running on the DPU. The DPU Operator is responsible for the life-cycle management of the ovn-kube components and the necessary host network initialization on the DPU.

The following table describes the currently supported DPU devices.

```


## Installing the DPU Operator using the web console

You can install the DPU Operator by using the web console. You can use the DPU Operator to simplify the installation process when setting up DPU device management on host clusters.

As a cluster administrator, you can install the DPU Operator by using the web console.

* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* An account with cluster-admin privileges.

1. In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, click Ecosystem -> Software Catalog.
2. Select DPU Operator from the list of available Operators, and then click Install.
3. On the Install Operator page, under Installed Namespace, the Operator recommended Namespace option is preselected by default. No action is required.
1. Click Install.

1. Navigate to the Ecosystem -> Installed Operators page.
2. Ensure that the openshift-dpu-operator project lists DPU Operator with a Status of InstallSucceeded.

[NOTE]
----
During installation an Operator might display a Failed status.
If the installation later succeeds with an InstallSucceeded message, you can ignore the Failed message.
----

* Inspect the Operator Subscriptions and Install Plans tabs for any failure or errors under Status.
* Navigate to the Workloads -> Pods page and check the logs for pods in the openshift-dpu-operator project.
* Check the namespace of the YAML file. If the annotation is missing, you can add the annotation workload.openshift.io/allowed=management to the Operator namespace with the following command:

```terminal
$ oc annotate ns/openshift-dpu-operator workload.openshift.io/allowed=management
```


[NOTE]
----
For single-node OpenShift clusters, the annotation workload.openshift.io/allowed=management is required for the namespace.
----

# Configuring the DPU Operator

You can configure the DPU Operator after installation to enable management of DPU devices and network attachments in both dual cluster and single cluster deployment modes.

You can configure the DPU Operator to manage the DPU devices and network attachments in your cluster.

To configure the DPU Operator follow these steps:

1. Create the DpuOperatorConfig Custom Resource (CR) based on your deployment mode:
* Dual Cluster Deployment: You must create the DpuOperatorConfig CR on both the host Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster and on each of the Red Hat build of MicroShift (MicroShift) DPU clusters.
* Single Cluster Deployment: This deployment uses a standard Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. You only need to create the DpuOperatorConfig CR once on this cluster.

The content of the CR is the same for all clusters.
2. Create a file named dpu-operator-config.yaml by using the following YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: DpuOperatorConfig
metadata:
 name: dpu-operator-config
spec:
 logLevel: 0
```

* metadata.name: Specifies the name of the Custom Resource, which must be dpu-operator-config.
* spec.logLevel: Sets the desired logging verbosity in the operator container logs. The value 0 is the default setting.
3. Create the resource by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f dpu-operator-config.yaml
```

4. Label all nodes that either have an attached DPU or are functioning as a DPU. You can apply this label by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc label node <node_name> dpu=true
```


where:
node_name:: Refers to the name of your node, such as worker-1.

[NOTE]
----
There are two ways to deploy clusters that are compatible with DPUs:
* Dual cluster deployment: This consists of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform running on the hosts and Red Hat build of MicroShift (MicroShift) running on the DPU. In this mode, the Red Hat build of MicroShift (MicroShift) instance also needs to deploy the DPU Operator, and you must set the label dpu=true on the node.
* Single cluster deployment: This consists of only Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform running on hosts, where the DPUs are integrated into the main cluster. DPUs just require the label dpu=true for both the host nodes with DPUs installed and the DPU nodes themselves. The DPU Operator automatically detects the role of the node whether it is running as a DPU or a host with an attached DPU.
----

# Running a workload on the host with DPU

You can deploy workloads on the host with DPU to offload specialized infrastructure tasks and improve performance while freeing up host CPU resources.

Running workloads on a DPU enables offloading specialized infrastructure tasks such as networking, security, and storage to a dedicated processing unit. This improves performance, enforces a stronger security boundary between infrastructure and application workloads, and frees up host CPU resources.

Follow these steps to deploy a workload on the host with DPU. This is the standard deployment model where the application runs on the host&#8217;s x86 CPU but utilizes the DPU for network acceleration and offload.

* The OpenShift CLI (oc) is installed.
* An account with cluster-admin privileges is available.
* The DPU Operator is installed.

1. Create a sample workload designed to run on the host-side worker node by using the following YAML. Save the file as workload-host.yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: default-sriov-net
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    kubernetes.io/hostname: worker-237
  containers:
  - name: appcntr1
    image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi:latest
    command: ['/bin/sh', '-c', 'sleep infinity']
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    securityContext:
      priviledged: true
      runAsNonRoot: false
      runAsUser: 0
      seccompProfile:
        type: RuntimeDefault
    resources:
      requests:
        openshift.io/dpu: '1'
      limits:
        openshift.io/dpu: '1'
```


spec.nodeSelector: The node selector schedules the pod on the node with the DPU resource. You can use any standard Kubernetes selector for this, such as kubernetes.io/hostname, to target a specific node as shown in the example YAML.

[NOTE]
----
For flexible scheduling, the DPU Operator creates the label dpu.config.openshift.io/dpuside: "dpu-host". This label enables the default scheduler to place the workload on any host with a DPU. The workload automatically joins that DPU secondary network.
When the label on the node is dpu.config.openshift.io/dpuside: "dpu", this signifies that the node is the DPU itself. The DPU Operator creates and manages the dpu.config.openshift.io/dpuside label .
----
2. Create the workload by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f workload-host.yaml
```


# Running a workload on the DPU

You can deploy network workloads directly on the DPU to improve performance, enhance security isolation, and reduce host CPU usage.

The DPU offloads network workloads, such as security functions or virtualized appliances, to improve performance, enhance security isolation, and free host CPU resources.

Follow this procedure to deploy a simple pod directly onto the DPU.

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* An account with cluster-admin privileges.
* Install the DPU Operator.

1. Save the following YAML file example as dpu-pod.yaml. This is an example of a simple pod that will be scheduled directly onto a DPU node by the Kubernetes default scheduler.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: "my-network-function"
  namespace: openshift-dpu-operator
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: dpunfcni-conf, dpunfcni-conf
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    dpu.config.openshift.io/dpuside: "dpu"
  containers:
    - name: "my-network-function"
      image: "quay.io/example-org/my-network-function:latest"
      resources:
        requests:
          openshift.io/dpu: "2"
        limits:
          openshift.io/dpu: "2"
      securityContext:
        privileged: true
        capabilities:
          drop:
            - ALL
          add:
            - NET_RAW
            - NET_ADMIN
```

* metadata.name.annotations.k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: The value dpunfcni-conf specifies the name of the NetworkAttachmentDefinition resource. The DPU Operator creates this resource during installation to configure the DPU networking.
* spec.nodeSelector: The nodeSelector is the primary mechanism for scheduling this workload. The DPU Operator creates and maintains the label: dpu.config.openshift.io/dpuside: "dpu". This label ensures the pod is scheduled directly onto the DPU's processing unit.
* spec.containers.name: The name of the container.
* spec.containers.image: The container image to pull and run.
2. Create the pod by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f dpu-pod.yaml
```

3. Verify the pod status by running the following command:

```bash
$ oc get pods -n openshift-dpu-operator
```


Ensure the pod&#8217;s status is Running.

# Monitoring the status of DPU

You can monitor the DPU infrastructure status to check the current state and health of your DPU devices across the cluster.

You can monitor the DPU status to see the current state of the DPU infrastructure.

The oc get dpu command shows the current state of the DPU infrastructure. Follow this procedure to monitor the status of various cards.

* The OpenShift CLI (oc) is installed.
* An account with cluster-admin privileges is available.
* The DPU Operator is installed.

1. Run the following command to check the overall health of your nodes:

```terminal
$ oc get nodes
```


The example output provides a list of all nodes in the cluster along with their status. Ensure that all nodes are in the Ready state before proceeding.

```terminal
NAME                           STATUS   ROLES    AGE    VERSION
ocpcluster-master-1            Ready    master   10d    v1.32.9
ocpcluster-master-2            Ready    master   10d    v1.32.9
ocpcluster-master-3            Ready    master   10d    v1.32.9
ocpcluster-dpu-ipu-219         Ready    worker   42h    v1.32.9
ocpcluster-dpu-marvell-41      Ready    worker   3d23h  v1.32.9
ocpcluster-dpu-ptl-243         Ready    worker   3d23h  v1.32.9
worker-host-ipu-219            Ready    worker   3d19h  v1.32.9
worker-host-marvell-41         Ready    worker   4d     v1.32.9
worker-host-ptl-243            Ready    worker   3d23h  v1.32.9
```


This output shows three master nodes, and three worker nodes identified by the worker-host prefix, for example, worker-host-ipu-219. Each worker node contains a DPU identified by the ocpcluster-dpu prefix, for example, ocpcluster-dpu-ipu-219.
2. Run the following command to report on the status of the DPUs:

```terminal
$ oc get dpu
```


The example output provides a list of detected DPUs.

```terminal
NAME                                 DPU PRODUCT                    DPU SIDE        MODE NAME               STATUS

intel-ipu-dpu                        Intel IPU E2100                true            worker-dpu-ipu-219      False
marvell-dpu-0000-87-00.0-host        Marvell DPU                    false           worker-host-marvell-41  True
marvell-dpu-ipu                      Marvell DPU                    true            worker-dpu-marvell-41   True
```

* DPU PRODUCT:Displays the vendor or type of DPU, for example, Intel or Marvell.
* DPU SIDE:Indicates whether the DPU is operating on the host side (false) or the DPU side (true). Each physical DPU is represented twice.
* MODE NAME:The name of the node where the DPU is located. This is the host worker node for false entries and the DPU node for true entries.
* STATUS:Indicates whether the DPU is functioning correctly (True) or has issues (False).
