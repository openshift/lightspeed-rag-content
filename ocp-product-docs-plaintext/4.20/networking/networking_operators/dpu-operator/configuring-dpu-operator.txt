# Configuring the DPU Operator


You can configure the DPU Operator to manage the DPU devices and network attachments in your cluster.

# Configuring the DPU Operator

To configure the DPU Operator follow these steps:

1. Create a DpuOperatorConfig custom resource (CR) on both the host cluster and on each of the DPU clusters. The DPU Operator in each cluster is activated after this CR is created.
2. Create a file named dpu-operator-host-config.yaml by using the following YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: DpuOperatorConfig
metadata:
 name: dpu-operator-config 1
spec:
 mode: host 2
```

The name of the custom resource must be dpu-operator-config.
Set the value to host on the host cluster. On each DPU cluster, which runs a single MicroShift cluster per DPU, set the value to dpu.
3. Create the resource by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f dpu-operator-host-config.yaml
```

4. You must label all nodes that either have an attached DPU or are functioning as a DPU. On the host cluster, this means labeling all compute nodes assuming each node has an attached DPU with dpu=true. On the DPU, where each MicroShift cluster consists of a single node, label that single node in each cluster with dpu=true. You can apply this label by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc label node <node_name> dpu=true
```


where:
node_name:: Refers to the name of your node, such as worker-1.
