# Configuring MetalLB BFD profiles


As a cluster administrator, you can add, modify, and delete Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) profiles.
The MetalLB Operator uses the BFD profile custom resources to identify which BGP sessions use BFD to provide faster path failure detection than BGP alone provides.

# About the BFD profile custom resource

The fields for the BFD profile custom resource are described in the following table.



# Configuring a BFD profile

As a cluster administrator, you can add a BFD profile and configure a BGP peer to use the profile. BFD provides faster path failure detection than BGP alone.

* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

1. Create a file, such as bfdprofile.yaml, with content like the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: BFDProfile
metadata:
  name: doc-example-bfd-profile-full
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  receiveInterval: 300
  transmitInterval: 300
  detectMultiplier: 3
  echoMode: false
  passiveMode: true
  minimumTtl: 254
```

2. Apply the configuration for the BFD profile:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f bfdprofile.yaml
```


# Next steps

* Configure a BGP peer to use the BFD profile.
