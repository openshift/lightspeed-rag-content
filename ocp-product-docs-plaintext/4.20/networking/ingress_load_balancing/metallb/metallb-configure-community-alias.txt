# Configuring community alias


As a cluster administrator, you can configure a community alias and use it across different advertisements.

# About the community custom resource

The community custom resource is a collection of aliases for communities. Users can define named aliases to be used when advertising ipAddressPools using the BGPAdvertisement. The fields for the community custom resource are described in the following table.


[NOTE]

The community CRD applies only to BGPAdvertisement.

# Configuring MetalLB with a BGP advertisement and community alias

Configure MetalLB as follows so that the IPAddressPool is advertised with the BGP protocol and the community alias set to the numeric value of the NO_ADVERTISE community.

In the following example, the peer BGP router doc-example-peer-community receives one 203.0.113.200/32 route and one fc00:f853:ccd:e799::1/128 route for each load-balancer IP address that MetalLB assigns to a service. A community alias is configured with the NO_ADVERTISE community.

* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

1. Create an IP address pool.
1. Create a file, such as ipaddresspool.yaml, with content like the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  namespace: metallb-system
  name: doc-example-bgp-community
spec:
  addresses:
    - 203.0.113.200/30
    - fc00:f853:ccd:e799::/124
```

2. Apply the configuration for the IP address pool:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f ipaddresspool.yaml
```

2. Create a community alias named community1.

```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: Community
metadata:
  name: community1
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  communities:
    - name: NO_ADVERTISE
      value: '65535:65282'
```

3. Create a BGP peer named doc-example-bgp-peer.
1. Create a file, such as bgppeer.yaml, with content like the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta2
kind: BGPPeer
metadata:
  namespace: metallb-system
  name: doc-example-bgp-peer
spec:
  peerAddress: 10.0.0.1
  peerASN: 64501
  myASN: 64500
  routerID: 10.10.10.10
```

2. Apply the configuration for the BGP peer:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f bgppeer.yaml
```

4. Create a BGP advertisement with the community alias.
1. Create a file, such as bgpadvertisement.yaml, with content like the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: BGPAdvertisement
metadata:
  name: bgp-community-sample
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  aggregationLength: 32
  aggregationLengthV6: 128
  communities:
    - NO_ADVERTISE 1
  ipAddressPools:
    - doc-example-bgp-community
  peers:
    - doc-example-peer
```

Specify the CommunityAlias.name here and not the community custom resource (CR) name.
2. Apply the configuration:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f bgpadvertisement.yaml
```
