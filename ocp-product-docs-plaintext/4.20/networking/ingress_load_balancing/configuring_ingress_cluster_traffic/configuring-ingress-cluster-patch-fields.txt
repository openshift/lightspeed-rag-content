# Patching Ingress objects to resolve an ingressWithoutClassName alert

The ingressClassName field specifies the name of the IngressClass object. You must define the ingressClassName field for each Ingress object.

If you have not defined the ingressClassName field for an Ingress object, you could experience routing issues. After 24 hours, you will receive an ingressWithoutClassName alert to remind you to set the ingressClassName field.

Patch the Ingress objects with a completed ingressClassName field to ensure proper routing and functionality.

1. List all IngressClass objects:

```terminal
$ oc get ingressclass
```

2. List all Ingress objects in all namespaces:

```terminal
$ oc get ingress -A
```

3. Patch the Ingress object:

```terminal
$ oc patch ingress/<ingress_name> --type=merge --patch '{"spec":{"ingressClassName":"openshift-default"}}'
```


Replace <ingress_name> with the name of the Ingress object. This command patches the Ingress object to include the desired ingress class name.
