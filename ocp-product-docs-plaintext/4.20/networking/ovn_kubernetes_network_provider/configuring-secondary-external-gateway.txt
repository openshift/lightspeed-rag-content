# Configure an external gateway on the default network


As a cluster administrator, you can configure an external gateway on the default network.
This feature offers the following benefits:
* Granular control over egress traffic on a per-namespace basis
* Flexible configuration of static and dynamic external gateway IP addresses
* Support for both IPv4 and IPv6 address families

# Prerequisites

* Your cluster uses the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin.
* Your infrastructure is configured to route traffic from the secondary external gateway.

# How {product-title} determines the external gateway IP address

You configure a secondary external gateway with the AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute custom resource (CR) from the k8s.ovn.org API group. The CR supports static and dynamic approaches to specifying an external gateway&#8217;s IP address.

Each namespace that a AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute CR targets cannot be selected by any other AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute CR. A namespace cannot have concurrent secondary external gateways.

Changes to policies are isolated in the controller. If a policy fails to apply, changes to other policies do not trigger a retry of other policies. Policies are only re-evaluated, applying any differences that might have occurred by the change, when updates to the policy itself or related objects to the policy such as target namespaces, pod gateways, or namespaces hosting them from dynamic hops are made.

Static assignment:: You specify an IP address directly.
Dynamic assignment:: You specify an IP address indirectly, with namespace and pod selectors, and an optional network attachment definition.
* If the name of a network attachment definition is provided, the external gateway IP address of the network attachment is used.
* If the name of a network attachment definition is not provided, the external gateway IP address for the pod itself is used. However, this approach works only if the pod is configured with hostNetwork set to true.

# AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute object configuration

You can define an AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute object, which is cluster scoped, with the following properties. A namespace can be selected by only one AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute CR at a time.









## Example secondary external gateway configurations

In the following example, the AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute object configures two static IP addresses as external gateways for pods in namespaces with the kubernetes.io/metadata.name: novxlan-externalgw-ecmp-4059 label.


```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.ovn.org/v1
kind: AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute
metadata:
  name: default-route-policy
spec:
  from:
    namespaceSelector:
      matchLabels:
        kubernetes.io/metadata.name: novxlan-externalgw-ecmp-4059
  nextHops:
    static:
    - ip: "172.18.0.8"
    - ip: "172.18.0.9"
```


In the following example, the AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute object configures a dynamic external gateway. The IP addresses used for the external gateway are derived from the additional network attachments associated with each of the selected pods.


```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.ovn.org/v1
kind: AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute
metadata:
  name: shadow-traffic-policy
spec:
  from:
    namespaceSelector:
      matchLabels:
        externalTraffic: ""
  nextHops:
    dynamic:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          gatewayPod: ""
      namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          shadowTraffic: ""
      networkAttachmentName: shadow-gateway
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          gigabyteGW: ""
      namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          gatewayNamespace: ""
      networkAttachmentName: gateway
```


In the following example, the AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute object configures both static and dynamic external gateways.


```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.ovn.org/v1
kind: AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute
metadata:
  name: multi-hop-policy
spec:
  from:
    namespaceSelector:
      matchLabels:
        trafficType: "egress"
  nextHops:
    static:
    - ip: "172.18.0.8"
    - ip: "172.18.0.9"
    dynamic:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          gatewayPod: ""
      namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          egressTraffic: ""
      networkAttachmentName: gigabyte
```


# Configure a secondary external gateway

You can configure an external gateway on the default network for a namespace in your cluster.

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You are logged in to the cluster with a user with cluster-admin privileges.

1. Create a YAML file that contains an AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute object.
2. To create an admin policy based external route, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f <file>.yaml
```

where:
<file>:: Specifies the name of the YAML file that you created in the previous step.
Example output

```text
adminpolicybasedexternalroute.k8s.ovn.org/default-route-policy created
```

3. To confirm that the admin policy based external route was created, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc describe apbexternalroute <name> | tail -n 6
```

where:
<name>:: Specifies the name of the AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute object.
Example output

```text
Status:
  Last Transition Time:  2023-04-24T15:09:01Z
  Messages:
  Configured external gateway IPs: 172.18.0.8
  Status:  Success
Events:  <none>
```
