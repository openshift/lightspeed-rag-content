# Disabling multicast for a project



# Disabling multicast between pods

You can disable multicast between pods for your project.

* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You must log in to the cluster with a user that has the cluster-admin role.

* Disable multicast by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc annotate {namespace} <namespace> \ 1
    {annotation}
```

The namespace for the project you want to disable multicast for.

[TIP]
----
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to delete the annotation:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: <namespace>
  annotations:
    k8s.ovn.org/multicast-enabled: null
```
