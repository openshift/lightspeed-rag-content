# Assigning an egress IP address


As a cluster administrator, you can assign an egress IP address for traffic leaving the cluster from a namespace or from specific pods in a namespace.

# Assigning an egress IP address to a namespace

You can assign one or more egress IP addresses to a namespace or to specific pods in a namespace.

* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* Log in to the cluster as a cluster administrator.
* Configure at least one node to host an egress IP address.

1. Create an EgressIP object:
1. Create a <egressips_name>.yaml file where <egressips_name> is the name of the object.
2. In the file that you created, define an EgressIP object, as in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.ovn.org/v1
kind: EgressIP
metadata:
  name: egress-project1
spec:
  egressIPs:
  - 192.168.127.10
  - 192.168.127.11
  namespaceSelector:
    matchLabels:
      env: qa
```

2. To create the object, enter the following command.

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <egressips_name>.yaml 1
```

Replace <egressips_name> with the name of the object.
Example output

```terminal
egressips.k8s.ovn.org/<egressips_name> created
```

3. Optional: Store the <egressips_name>.yaml file so that you can make changes later.
4. Add labels to the namespace that requires egress IP addresses. To add a label to the namespace of an EgressIP object defined in step 1, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc label ns <namespace> env=qa 1
```

Replace <namespace> with the namespace that requires egress IP addresses.

* To show all egress IPs that are in use in your cluster, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get egressip -o yaml
```


[NOTE]
----
The command oc get egressip only returns one egress IP address regardless of how many are configured. This is not a bug and is a limitation of Kubernetes. As a workaround, you can pass in the -o yaml or -o json flags to return all egress IPs addresses in use.

Example output

```terminal
# ...
spec:
  egressIPs:
  - 192.168.127.10
  - 192.168.127.11
# ...
```
