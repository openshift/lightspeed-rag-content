# Enabling BGP routing


As a cluster administrator, you can enable OVN-Kubernetes Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing support for your cluster.

# Enabling Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing

As a cluster administrator, you can enable Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing support for your cluster on bare-metal infrastructure.

If you are using BGP routing in conjunction with the MetalLB Operator, the necessary BGP routing support is enabled automatically. You do not need to manually enable BGP routing support.

## Enabling BGP routing support

As a cluster administrator, you can enable BGP routing support for your cluster.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You are logged in to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* The cluster is installed on compatible infrastructure.

* To enable a dynamic routing provider, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc patch Network.operator.openshift.io/cluster --type=merge -p '{
  "spec": {
    "additionalRoutingCapabilities": {
      "providers": ["FRR"]
    }
  }
}'
```
