# Enabling route advertisements

As a cluster administrator, you can enable additional routing support for your cluster.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You are logged in to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* The cluster is installed on compatible infrastructure.

* To enable a routing provider and additional route advertisements, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc patch Network.operator.openshift.io cluster --type=merge \
  -p='{
    "spec": {
      "additionalRoutingCapabilities": {
        "providers": ["FRR"]
        },
        "defaultNetwork": {
          "ovnKubernetesConfig": {
            "routeAdvertisements": "Enabled"
    }}}}'
```
