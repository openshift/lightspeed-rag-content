# Configuring the node port service range


During cluster installation, you can configure the node port range to meet the requirements of your cluster. After cluster installation, only a cluster administrator can expand the range as a postinstallation task. If your cluster uses a large number of node ports, consider increasing the available port range according to the requirements of your cluster.
If you do not set a node port range during cluster installation, the default range of 30000-32768 applies to your cluster. In this situation, you can expand the range on either side, but you must preserve 30000-32768 within your new port range.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Red Hat has not performed testing outside the default port range of 30000-32768. For ranges outside the default port range, ensure that you test to verify the expanding node port range does not impact your cluster. In particular, ensure that there is:
* No overlap with any ports already in use by host processes
* No overlap with any ports already in use by pods that are configured with host networking
If you expanded the range and a port allocation issue occurs, create a new cluster and set the required range for it.
If you expand the node port range and OpenShift CLI (`oc`) stops working because of a port conflict with the {product-title} API server, you must create a new cluster.

# Expanding the node port range

You can expand the node port range for your cluster. After you install your {product-title} cluster, you cannot shrink the node port range on either side of the currently configured range.

Red Hat has not performed testing outside the default port range of 30000-32768. For ranges outside the default port range, ensure that you test to verify that expanding your node port range does not impact your cluster. If you expanded the range and a port allocation issue occurs, create a new cluster and set the required range for it.
----

* Installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Logged in to the cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* You ensured that your cluster infrastructure allows access to the ports that exist in the extended range. For example, if you expand the node port range to 30000-32900, your firewall or packet filtering configuration must allow the inclusive port range of 30000-32900.

* To expand the range for the serviceNodePortRange parameter in the network.config.openshift.io object that your cluster uses to manage traffic for pods, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc patch network.config.openshift.io cluster --type=merge -p \
  '{
    "spec":
      { "serviceNodePortRange": "<port_range>" }
  }'
```

where:
<port_range>:: specifies your expanded range, such as 30000-32900.

[TIP]
----
You can also apply the following YAML to update the node port range:

```yaml
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  serviceNodePortRange: "<port_range>"
# ...
```

----
Example output

```terminal
network.config.openshift.io/cluster patched
```


* To confirm that the updated configuration is active, enter the following command. The update can take several minutes to apply.

```terminal
$ oc get configmaps -n openshift-kube-apiserver config \
  -o jsonpath="{.data['config\.yaml']}" | \
  grep -Eo '"service-node-port-range":["[[:digit:]]+-[[:digit:]]+"]'
```

Example output

```terminal
"service-node-port-range":["30000-32900"]
```
