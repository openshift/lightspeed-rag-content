# Removing a secondary NetworkAttachmentDefinition custom resource

To clean up unused network configurations or free up network resources in {product-title}, you can remove a secondary NetworkAttachmentDefinition CR. Edit the Cluster Network Operator CR and delete the NetworkAttachmentDefinition CR to remove the secondary network from your cluster.

When a secondary network is removed from the cluster, it is not removed from any pods that it is attached to.

* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

1. Edit the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) in your default text editor by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc edit networks.operator.openshift.io cluster
```

2. Modify the custom resource (CR) by removing the configuration that the CNO created from the additionalNetworks collection for the secondary network that you want to remove.

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  additionalNetworks: []
```

where:
additionalNetworks:: Specifies the secondary network attachment definition that you want to remove from the additionalNetworks collection. If you are removing the configuration mapping for the only secondary network attachment definition in the additionalNetworks collection, you must specify an empty collection.
3. Remove the NetworkAttachmentDefinition CR from the network of your cluster by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete net-attach-def <name_of_network_attachment_definition>
```


Replace <name_of_network_attachment_definition> with the name of the NetworkAttachmentDefinition CR that you want to remove.
4. Save your changes and quit the text editor to commit your changes.
5. Optional: Confirm that the secondary network CR was deleted by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get network-attachment-definition --all-namespaces
```
