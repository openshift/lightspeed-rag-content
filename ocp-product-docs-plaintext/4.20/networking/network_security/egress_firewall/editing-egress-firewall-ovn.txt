# Editing an egress firewall for a project


As a cluster administrator, you can modify network traffic rules for an existing egress firewall.

# Editing an EgressFirewall custom resource (CR)

As a cluster administrator, you can update the egress firewall for a project.

* A cluster using the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You must log in to the cluster as a cluster administrator.

1. Find the name of the EgressFirewall CR for the project. Replace <project> with the name of the project.

```terminal
$ oc get -n <project> egressfirewall
```

2. Optional: If you did not save a copy of the EgressFirewall object when you created the egress network firewall, enter the following command to create a copy.

```terminal
$ oc get -n <project> egressfirewall <name> -o yaml > <filename>.yaml
```


Replace <project> with the name of the project. Replace <name> with the name of the object. Replace <filename> with the name of the file to save the YAML to.
3. After making changes to the policy rules, enter the following command to replace the EgressFirewall CR. Replace <filename> with the name of the file containing the updated EgressFirewall CR.

```terminal
$ oc replace -f <filename>.yaml
```
