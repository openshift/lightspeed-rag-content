# Editing an egress firewall for a project


As a cluster administrator, you can modify network traffic rules for an existing egress firewall.

# Editing an EgressFirewall object

As a cluster administrator, you can update the egress firewall for a project.

* A cluster using the {cni} network plugin.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You must log in to the cluster as a cluster administrator.

1. Find the name of the {kind} object for the project. Replace <project> with the name of the project.

```terminal
$ oc get -n <project> {res}
```

2. Optional: If you did not save a copy of the {kind} object when you created the egress network firewall, enter the following command to create a copy.

```terminal
$ oc get -n <project> {res} <name> -o yaml > <filename>.yaml
```


Replace <project> with the name of the project. Replace <name> with the name of the object. Replace <filename> with the name of the file to save the YAML to.
3. After making changes to the policy rules, enter the following command to replace the {kind} object. Replace <filename> with the name of the file containing the updated {kind} object.

```terminal
$ oc replace -f <filename>.yaml
```
