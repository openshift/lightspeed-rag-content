# Service Mesh Operators overview

Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh requires the use of the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator which allows you to connect, secure, control, and observe the microservices that comprise your applications. You can also install other Operators to enhance your service mesh experience.


[WARNING]
----
Do not install Community versions of the Operators. Community Operators are not supported.

The following Operator is required:

Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator:: Allows you to connect, secure, control, and observe the microservices that comprise your applications. It also defines and monitors the ServiceMeshControlPlane resources that manage the deployment, updating, and deletion of the Service Mesh components. It is based on the open source Istio project.

The following Operators are optional:

Kiali Operator provided by Red Hat:: Provides observability for your service mesh. You can view configurations, monitor traffic, and analyze traces in a single console. It is based on the open source Kiali project.
