* Istio bundle image name: openshift-service-mesh/istio-operator-bundle
* Kiali bundle image name: openshift-service-mesh/kiali-operator-bundle

## Integration with Red Hat OpenShift Distributed Tracing Platform and Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry

This release introduces a generally available integration of the tracing extension provider(s) Red Hat OpenShift Distributed Tracing Platform and Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry.

You can expose tracing data to the Red Hat OpenShift Distributed Tracing Platform by appending a named element and the opentelemetry provider to the spec.meshConfig.extensionProviders specification in the ServiceMehControlPlane resource. Then, a telemetry custom resource configures Istio proxies to collect trace spans and send them to the OpenTelemetry Collector endpoint.

You can create a Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry instance in a mesh namespace and configure it to send tracing data to a tracing platform backend service.

## Red Hat OpenShift Distributed Tracing Platform (Jaeger) default setting change

This release disables Red Hat OpenShift Distributed Tracing Platform (Jaeger) by default for new instances of the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource.

When updating existing instances of the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource to Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh version 2.6, Distributed Tracing Platform (Jaeger) remains enabled by default.

Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh 2.6 is the last release that includes support for Red Hat OpenShift Distributed Tracing Platform (Jaeger) and OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator. Both Distributed Tracing Platform (Jaeger) and OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator will be removed in the next release. If you are currently using Distributed Tracing Platform (Jaeger) and OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator, you need to switch to Red Hat OpenShift Distributed Tracing Platform and Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry.

## Gateway API use is generally available for Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh cluster-wide deployments

This release introduces the General Availability for using the Kubernetes Gateway API version 1.0.0 with Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh 2.6. This API use is limited to Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh. The Gateway API custom resource definitions (CRDs) are not supported.

Gateway API is now enabled by default if cluster-wide mode is enabled (spec.mode: ClusterWide). It can be enabled even if the custom resource definitions (CRDs) are not installed in the cluster.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Gateway API for multitenant mesh deployments is still in Technology Preview.
----

Refer to the following table to determine which Gateway API version should be installed with the OpenShift Service Mesh version you are using:



You can disable this feature by setting PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API to false:


```yaml
apiVersion: maistra.io/v2
kind: ServiceMeshControlPlane
metadata:
  name: basic
spec:
  runtime:
    components:
      pilot:
        container:
          env:
            PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API: "false"
```


## Fixed issues

* OSSM-6754 Previously, in {product-title} 4.15, when users navigated to a Service details page, clicked the Service Mesh tab, and refreshed the page, the Service Mesh details page remained stuck on Service Mesh content information, even though the active tab was the default Details tab. Now, after a refresh, users can navigate through the different tabs of the Service details page without issue.
* OSSM-2101 Previously, the Istio Operator never deleted the istio-cni-node DaemonSet and other CNI resources when they were no longer needed. Now, after upgrading the Operator, if there is at least one SMCP installed in the cluster, the Operator reconciles this SMCP, and then deletes all unused CNI installations (even very old CNI versions as early as v2.0).

## Kiali known issues

* OSSM-6099 Installing the OpenShift Service Mesh Console (OSSMC) plugin fails on an IPv6 cluster.

Workaround: Install the OSSMC plugin on an IPv4 cluster.

## Component updates



## Fixed issues

* OSSM-6331 Previously, the smcp.general.logging.componentLevels spec accepted invalid LogLevel values, and the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource was still created. Now, the terminal shows an error message if an invalid value is used, and the control plane is not created.
* OSSM-6290 Previously, the Project filter drop-down of the Istio Config list page did not work correctly. All istio config items were displayed from all namespaces even if you selected a specific project from the drop-down menu. Now, only the istio config items that belong to the selected project in the filter drop-down are displayed.
* OSSM-6298 Previously, when you clicked an item reference within the OpenShift Service Mesh Console (OSSMC) plugin, the console sometimes performed multiple redirects before opening the desired page. As a result, navigating back to the previous page that was open in the console caused your web browser to open the wrong page. Now, these redirects do not occur, and clicking Back in a web browser opens the correct page.
* OSSM-6299 Previously, in {product-title} 4.15, when you clicked the Node graph menu option of any node menu within the traffic graph, the node graph was not displayed. Instead, the page refreshed with the same traffic graph. Now, clicking the Node graph menu option correctly displays the node graph.
* OSSM-6267 Previously, configuring a data source in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh 2.5 Grafana caused a data query authentication error, and users could not view data in the Istio service and workload dashboards. Now, upgrading an existing 2.5 SMCP to version 2.5.2 or later resolves the Grafana error.

### Component versions for Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh version 2.5



### Istio 1.18 support

Service Mesh 2.5 is based on Istio 1.18, which brings in new features and product enhancements. While Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh supports many Istio 1.18 features, the following exceptions should be noted:

* Ambient mesh is not supported
* QuickAssist Technology (QAT) PrivateKeyProvider in Istio is not supported

### Cluster-Wide mesh migration

This release adds documentation for migrating from a multitenant mesh to a cluster-wide mesh. For more information, see the following documentation:

* "About migrating to a cluster-wide mesh"
* "Excluding namespaces from a cluster-wide mesh"
* "Defining which namespaces receive sidecar injection in a cluster-wide mesh"
* "Excluding individual pods from a cluster-wide mesh"

### Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator on ARM-based clusters

This release provides the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator on ARM-based clusters as a generally available feature.

### Integration with Red Hat OpenShift Distributed Tracing Platform (Tempo) Stack

This release introduces a generally available integration of the tracing extension provider(s). You can expose tracing data to the Red Hat OpenShift Distributed Tracing Platform (Tempo) stack by appending a named element and the zipkin provider to the spec.meshConfig.extensionProviders specification. Then, a telemetry custom resource configures Istio proxies to collect trace spans and send them to the Tempo distributor service endpoint.


[NOTE]
----
Red Hat OpenShift Distributed Tracing Platform (Tempo) Stack is not supported on IBM Z.
----

### OpenShift Service Mesh Console plugin

This release introduces a generally available version of the OpenShift Service Mesh Console (OSSMC) plugin.

The OSSMC plugin is an extension to the OpenShift Console that provides visibility into your Service Mesh. With the OSSMC plugin installed, a new Service Mesh menu option is available on the navigation pane of the web console, as well as new Service Mesh tabs that enhance existing Workloads and Service console pages.

The features of the OSSMC plugin are very similar to those of the standalone Kiali Console. The OSSMC plugin does not replace the Kiali Console, and after installing the OSSMC plugin, you can still access the standalone Kiali Console.

### Istio OpenShift Routing (IOR) default setting change

The default setting for Istio OpenShift Routing (IOR) has changed. Starting with this release, automatic routes are disabled by default for new instances of the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource.

For new  instances of the ServiceMeshControlPlane resources, you can use automatic routes by setting the enabled field to true in the gateways.openshiftRoute specification of the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource.


```yaml
apiVersion: maistra.io/v2
kind: ServiceMeshControlPlane
spec:
  gateways:
    openshiftRoute:
      enabled: true
```


When updating existing instances of the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource to Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh version 2.5, automatic routes remain enabled by default.

### Istio proxy concurrency configuration enhancement

The concurrency parameter in the networking.istio API configures how many worker threads the Istio proxy runs.

For consistency across deployments, Istio now configures the concurrency parameter based upon the CPU limit allocated to the proxy container. For example, a limit of 2500m would set the concurrency parameter to 3. If you set the concurrency parameter to a different value, then Istio uses that value to configure how many threads the proxy runs instead of using the CPU limit.

Previously, the default setting for the parameter was 2.

### Gateway API CRD versions

### Component versions included in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh version 2.4.3



### Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh operator to ARM-based clusters


[IMPORTANT]
----
{FeatureName} is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
----

This release makes the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator available on ARM-based clusters as a Technology Preview feature. Images are available for Istio, Envoy, Prometheus, Kiali, and Grafana. Images are not available for Jaeger, so Jaeger must be disabled as a Service Mesh add-on.

### Remote Procedure Calls (gRPC) API support for external authorization configuration

This enhancement adds the envoyExtAuthzGrpc field to configure an external authorization provider using the gRPC API.

## New features Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh version 2.4.2

## New features Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh version 2.4

This release of Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh addresses Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), contains bug fixes, and is supported on {product-title} 4.10 and later versions.

### Component versions included in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh version 2.4



### Cluster-wide deployments

This enhancement introduces a generally available version of cluster-wide deployments. A cluster-wide deployment contains a service mesh control plane that monitors resources for an entire cluster. The control plane uses a single query across all namespaces to monitor each Istio or Kubernetes resource that affects the mesh configuration. Reducing the number of queries the control plane performs in a cluster-wide deployment improves performance.

### Support for discovery selectors

This enhancement introduces a generally available version of the meshConfig.discoverySelectors field, which can be used in cluster-wide deployments to limit the services the service mesh control plane can discover.


```yaml
spec:
  meshConfig
    discoverySelectors:
    - matchLabels:
        env: prod
        region: us-east1
    - matchExpressions:
      - key: app
        operator: In
        values:
          - cassandra
          - spark
```


### Integration with cert-manager istio-csr

With this update, Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh integrates with the cert-manager controller and the istio-csr agent. cert-manager adds certificates and certificate issuers as resource types in Kubernetes clusters, and simplifies the process of obtaining, renewing, and using those certificates. cert-manager provides and rotates an intermediate CA certificate for Istio. Integration with istio-csr enables users to delegate signing certificate requests from Istio proxies to cert-manager. ServiceMeshControlPlane v2.4 accepts CA certificates provided by cert-manager as cacerts secret.


[NOTE]
----
Integration with cert-manager and istio-csr is not supported on IBM Power(R), IBM Z(R), and IBM(R) LinuxONE.
----

### Integration with external authorization systems

This enhancement introduces a generally available method of integrating Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh with external authorization systems by using the action: CUSTOM field of the AuthorizationPolicy resource. Use the envoyExtAuthzHttp field to delegate the access control to an external authorization system.

### Integration with external Prometheus installation

This enhancement introduces a generally available version of the Prometheus extension provider. You can expose metrics to the {product-title} monitoring stack or a custom Prometheus installation by setting the value of the extensionProviders field to prometheus in the spec.meshConfig specification. The telemetry object configures Istio proxies to collect traffic metrics. Service Mesh only supports the Telemetry API for Prometheus metrics.


```yaml
spec:
  meshConfig:
    extensionProviders:
    - name: prometheus
      prometheus: {}
---
apiVersion: telemetry.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: Telemetry
metadata:
  name: enable-prometheus-metrics
spec:
  metrics:
  - providers:
    - name: prometheus
```


### Single stack IPv6 support

This enhancement introduces generally available support for single stack IPv6 clusters, providing access to a broader range of IP addresses. Dual stack IPv4 or IPv6 cluster is not supported.


[NOTE]
----
Single stack IPv6 support is not available on IBM Power(R), IBM Z(R), and IBM(R) LinuxONE.
----

### {product-title} Gateway API support


[IMPORTANT]
----
{FeatureName} is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete.

```yaml
spec:
  techPreview:
    gatewayAPI:
      enabled: true
```


Previously, environment variables were used to enable the Gateway API.


```yaml
spec:
  runtime:
    components:
      pilot:
        container:
          env:
            PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API: "true"
            PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_STATUS: "true"
            PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_DEPLOYMENT_CONTROLLER: "true"
```

### Cluster-wide deployment


[IMPORTANT]
----
{FeatureName} is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
----

This release introduces cluster-wide deployment as a Technology Preview feature. A cluster-wide deployment contains a Service Mesh Control Plane that monitors resources for an entire cluster. The control plane uses a single query across all namespaces to monitor each Istio or Kubernetes resource kind that affects the mesh configuration. In contrast, the multitenant approach uses a query per namespace for each resource kind. Reducing the number of queries the control plane performs in a cluster-wide deployment improves performance.


[NOTE]
----
This cluster-wide deployment documentation is only applicable for control planes deployed using SMCP v2.3. cluster-wide deployments created using SMCP v2.3 are not compatible with cluster-wide deployments created using SMCP v2.4.
----

#### Configuring cluster-wide deployment

The following example ServiceMeshControlPlane object configures a cluster-wide deployment.

To create an SMCP for cluster-wide deployment, a user must belong to the cluster-admin ClusterRole. If the SMCP is configured for cluster-wide deployment, it must be the only SMCP in the cluster. You cannot change the control plane mode from multitenant to cluster-wide (or from cluster-wide to multitenant). If a multitenant control plane already exists, delete it and create a new one.

This example configures the SMCP for cluster-wide deployment.


```yaml
  apiVersion: maistra.io/v2
  kind: ServiceMeshControlPlane
  metadata:
    name: cluster-wide
    namespace: istio-system
  spec:
    version: v2.3
    techPreview:
      controlPlaneMode: ClusterScoped 1
```


Enables Istiod to monitor resources at the cluster level rather than monitor each individual namespace.

Additionally, the SMMR must also be configured for cluster-wide deployment. This example configures the SMMR for cluster-wide deployment.


```yaml
  apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
  kind: ServiceMeshMemberRoll
  metadata:
    name: default
  spec:
    members:
    - '*' 1
```


Adds all namespaces to the mesh, including any namespaces you subsequently create. The following namespaces are not part of the mesh: kube, openshift, kube-* and openshift-*.

### Kubernetes Gateway API


[IMPORTANT]
----
{FeatureName} is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
----

Kubernetes Gateway API is a technology preview feature that is disabled by default. If the Kubernetes API deployment controller is disabled, you must manually deploy and link an ingress gateway to the created Gateway object.

If the Kubernetes API deployment controller is enabled, then an ingress gateway automatically deploys when a Gateway object is created.

#### Installing the Gateway API CRDs

The Gateway API CRDs do not come preinstalled by default on OpenShift clusters. Install the CRDs prior to enabling Gateway API support in the SMCP.


```terminal
$ kubectl get crd gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io || { kubectl kustomize "github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/config/crd?ref=v0.4.0" | kubectl apply -f -; }
```


#### Enabling Kubernetes Gateway API

To enable the feature, set the following environment variables for the Istiod container in ServiceMeshControlPlane:


```yaml
spec:
  runtime:
    components:
      pilot:
        container:
          env:
            PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API: "true"
            PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_STATUS: "true"
            # and optionally, for the deployment controller
            PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_DEPLOYMENT_CONTROLLER: "true"
```


Restricting route attachment on Gateway API listeners is possible using the SameNamespace or All settings. Istio ignores usage of label selectors in listeners.allowedRoutes.namespaces and reverts to the default behavior (SameNamespace).

#### Manually linking an existing gateway to a Gateway resource

If the Kubernetes API deployment controller is disabled, you must manually deploy and then link an ingress gateway to the created Gateway resource.


```yaml
  apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2
  kind: Gateway
  metadata:
    name: gateway
  spec:
    addresses:
    - value: ingress.istio-gateways.svc.cluster.local
      type: Hostname
```

## New features Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh 2.1.1

This release of Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh addresses Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) and bug fixes.

This release also adds the ability to disable the automatic creation of network policies.

### Component versions included in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh version 2.1.1



### Disabling network policies

Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh automatically creates and manages a number of NetworkPolicies resources in the Service Mesh control plane and application namespaces. This is to ensure that applications and the control plane can communicate with each other.

If you want to disable the automatic creation and management of NetworkPolicies resources, for example to enforce company security policies, you can do so.  You can edit the ServiceMeshControlPlane to set the spec.security.manageNetworkPolicy setting to false


[NOTE]
----
When you disable spec.security.manageNetworkPolicy Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh will not create any NetworkPolicy objects.  The system administrator is responsible for managing the network and fixing any issues this might cause.
----

1. In the {product-title} web console, click Operators -> Installed Operators.
2. Select the project where you installed the Service Mesh control plane, for example istio-system, from the Project menu.
3. Click the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator. In the Istio Service Mesh Control Plane column, click the name of your ServiceMeshControlPlane, for example basic-install.
4. On the Create ServiceMeshControlPlane Details page, click YAML to modify your configuration.
5. Set the ServiceMeshControlPlane field spec.security.manageNetworkPolicy to false, as shown in this example.

```yaml
apiVersion: maistra.io/v2
kind: ServiceMeshControlPlane
spec:
  security:
      trust:
      manageNetworkPolicy: false
```

6. Click Save.

### Component versions included in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh version 2.1



### Service Mesh Federation

New Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) have been added to support federating service meshes. Service meshes may be federated both within the same cluster or across different OpenShift clusters. These new resources include:

* ServiceMeshPeer - Defines a federation with a separate service mesh, including gateway configuration, root trust certificate configuration, and status fields. In a pair of federated meshes, each mesh will define its own separate ServiceMeshPeer resource.
* ExportedServiceMeshSet - Defines which services for a given ServiceMeshPeer are available for the peer mesh to import.
* ImportedServiceSet - Defines which services for a given ServiceMeshPeer are imported from the peer mesh. These services must also be made available by the peer’s ExportedServiceMeshSet resource.

Service Mesh Federation is not supported between clusters on Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS, Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO), or OpenShift Dedicated.

### OVN-Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) generally available

The OVN-Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) was previously introduced as a Technology Preview feature in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh 2.0.1 and is now generally available in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh 2.1 and 2.0.x for use on {product-title} 4.7.32, {product-title} 4.8.12, and {product-title} 4.9.

### Service Mesh WebAssembly (WASM) Extensions

The ServiceMeshExtensions Custom Resource Definition (CRD), first introduced in 2.0 as Technology Preview, is now generally available. You can use CRD to build your own plugins, but Red Hat does not provide support for the plugins you create.

Mixer has been completely removed in Service Mesh 2.1. Upgrading from a Service Mesh 2.0.x release to 2.1 will be blocked if Mixer is enabled. Mixer plugins will need to be ported to WebAssembly Extensions.

### 3scale WebAssembly Adapter (WASM)

With Mixer now officially removed, OpenShift Service Mesh 2.1 does not support the 3scale mixer adapter. Before upgrading to Service Mesh 2.1, remove the Mixer-based 3scale adapter and any additional Mixer plugins. Then, manually install and configure the new 3scale WebAssembly adapter with Service Mesh 2.1+ using a ServiceMeshExtension resource.

3scale 2.11 introduces an updated Service Mesh integration based on  WebAssembly.

### Istio 1.9 Support

Service Mesh 2.1 is based on Istio 1.9, which brings in a large number of new features and product enhancements. While the majority of Istio 1.9 features are supported, the following exceptions should be noted:

* Virtual Machine integration is not yet supported
* Kubernetes Gateway API is not yet supported
* Remote fetch and load of WebAssembly HTTP filters are not yet supported
* Custom CA Integration using the Kubernetes CSR API is not yet supported
* Request Classification for monitoring traffic is a tech preview feature
* Integration with external authorization systems via Authorization policy’s CUSTOM action is a tech preview feature

### Improved Service Mesh operator performance

The amount of time Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh uses to prune old resources at the end of every ServiceMeshControlPlane reconciliation has been reduced. This results in faster ServiceMeshControlPlane deployments, and allows changes applied to existing SMCPs to take effect more quickly.

### Kiali updates

Kiali 1.36 includes the following features and enhancements:

* Service Mesh troubleshooting functionality
* Control plane and gateway monitoring
* Proxy sync statuses
* Envoy configuration views

### Change in how Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh handles URI fragments

Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability, CVE-2021-39156, where an HTTP request with a fragment (a section in the end of a URI that begins with a # character) in the URI path could bypass the Istio URI path-based authorization policies. For instance, an Istio authorization policy denies requests sent to the URI path /user/profile. In the vulnerable versions, a request with URI path /user/profile#section1 bypasses the deny policy and routes to the backend (with the normalized URI path /user/profile%23section1), possibly leading to a security incident.

You are impacted by this vulnerability if you use authorization policies with DENY actions and operation.paths, or ALLOW actions and operation.notPaths.

With the mitigation, the fragment part of the request’s URI is removed before the authorization and routing. This prevents a request with a fragment in its URI from bypassing authorization policies which are based on the URI without the fragment part.

To opt-out from the new behavior in the mitigation, the fragment section in the URI will be kept. You can configure your ServiceMeshControlPlane to keep URI fragments.


[WARNING]
----
Disabling the new behavior will normalize your paths as described above and is considered unsafe. Ensure that you have accommodated for this in any security policies before opting to keep URI fragments.
----


```yaml
apiVersion: maistra.io/v2
kind: ServiceMeshControlPlane
metadata:
  name: basic
spec:
  techPreview:
    meshConfig:
      defaultConfig:
        proxyMetadata: HTTP_STRIP_FRAGMENT_FROM_PATH_UNSAFE_IF_DISABLED: "false"
```


### Required update for authorization policies

Istio generates hostnames for both the hostname itself and all matching ports. For instance, a virtual service or Gateway for a host of "httpbin.foo" generates a config matching "httpbin.foo and httpbin.foo:*". However, exact match authorization policies only match the exact string given for the hosts or notHosts fields.

Your cluster is impacted if you have AuthorizationPolicy resources using exact string comparison for the rule to determine hosts or notHosts.

You must update your authorization policy rules to use prefix match instead of exact match.  For example, replacing hosts: ["httpbin.com"] with hosts: ["httpbin.com:*"] in the first AuthorizationPolicy example.


```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
  name: httpbin
  namespace: foo
spec:
  action: DENY
  rules:
  - from:
    - source:
        namespaces: ["dev"]
    to:
    - operation:
        hosts: [“httpbin.com”,"httpbin.com:*"]
```



```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
  name: httpbin
  namespace: default
spec:
  action: DENY
  rules:
  - to:
    - operation:
        hosts: ["httpbin.example.com:*"]
```

[IMPORTANT]
----
There are manual steps that must be completed to address CVE-2021-29492 and CVE-2021-31920.
----

### Manual updates required by CVE-2021-29492 and CVE-2021-31920

Istio contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability where an HTTP request path with multiple slashes or escaped slash characters (%2F or %5C) could potentially bypass an Istio authorization policy when path-based authorization rules are used.

For example, assume an Istio cluster administrator defines an authorization DENY policy to reject the request at path /admin. A request sent to the URL path //admin will NOT be rejected by the authorization policy.

According to RFC 3986, the path //admin with multiple slashes should technically be treated as a different path from the /admin. However, some backend services choose to normalize the URL paths by merging multiple slashes into a single slash. This can result in a bypass of the authorization policy (//admin does not match /admin), and a user can access the resource at path /admin in the backend; this would represent a security incident.

Your cluster is impacted by this vulnerability if you have authorization policies using ALLOW action + notPaths field or DENY action + paths field patterns. These patterns are vulnerable to unexpected policy bypasses.

Your cluster is NOT impacted by this vulnerability if:

* You don’t have authorization policies.
* Your authorization policies don’t define paths or notPaths fields.
* Your authorization policies use ALLOW action + paths field or DENY action + notPaths field patterns. These patterns could only cause unexpected rejection instead of policy bypasses. The upgrade is optional for these cases.


[NOTE]
----
The Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh configuration location for path normalization is different from the Istio configuration.
----

### Updating the path normalization configuration

Istio authorization policies can be based on the URL paths in the HTTP request.
Path normalization, also known as URI normalization, modifies and standardizes the incoming requests' paths so that the normalized paths can be processed in a standard way.
Syntactically different paths may be equivalent after path normalization.

Istio supports the following normalization schemes on the request paths before evaluating against the authorization policies and routing the requests:



The normalization algorithms are conducted in the following order:

1. Percent-decode %2F, %2f, %5C and %5c.
2. The RFC 3986 and other normalization implemented by the normalize_path option in Envoy.
3. Merge slashes.


[WARNING]
----
While these normalization options represent recommendations from HTTP standards and common industry practices, applications may interpret a URL in any way it chooses to. When using denial policies, ensure that you understand how your application behaves.
----

### Path normalization configuration examples

Ensuring Envoy normalizes request paths to match your backend services' expectations is critical to the security of your system.
The following examples can be used as a reference for you to configure your system.
The normalized URL paths, or the original URL paths if NONE is selected, will be:

1. Used to check against the authorization policies.
2. Forwarded to the backend application.



### Configuring your SMCP for path normalization

To configure path normalization for Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh, specify the following in your ServiceMeshControlPlane. Use the configuration examples to help determine the settings for your system.


```yaml
spec:
  techPreview:
    global:
      pathNormalization: <option>
```


### Configuring for case normalization

In some environments, it may be useful to have paths in authorization policies compared in a case insensitive manner.
For example, treating https://myurl/get and https://myurl/GeT as equivalent.
In those cases, you can use the EnvoyFilter shown below.
This filter will change both the path used for comparison and the path presented to the application. In this example, istio-system is the name of the Service Mesh control plane project.

Save the EnvoyFilter to a file and run the following command:


```terminal
$ oc create -f <myEnvoyFilterFile>
```



```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: EnvoyFilter
metadata:
  name: ingress-case-insensitive
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  configPatches:
  - applyTo: HTTP_FILTER
    match:
      context: GATEWAY
      listener:
        filterChain:
          filter:
            name: "envoy.filters.network.http_connection_manager"
            subFilter:
              name: "envoy.filters.http.router"
    patch:
      operation: INSERT_BEFORE
      value:
        name: envoy.lua
        typed_config:
            "@type": "type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.filters.http.lua.v3.Lua"
            inlineCode: |
              function envoy_on_request(request_handle)
                local path = request_handle:headers():get(":path")
                request_handle:headers():replace(":path", string.lower(path))
              end
```

* AES256-SHA

The ServiceMeshExtension API, which was deprecated in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh version 2.2, was removed in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh version 2.3. If you are using the ServiceMeshExtension API, you must migrate to the WasmPlugin API to continue using your WebAssembly extensions.

## Deprecated features in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh 2.2

The ServiceMeshExtension API is deprecated as of release 2.2 and will be removed in a future release.  While ServiceMeshExtension API is still supported in release 2.2, customers should start moving to the new WasmPlugin API.

## Removed features in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh 2.2

This release marks the end of support for Service Mesh control planes based on Service Mesh 1.1 for all platforms.

## Removed features in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh 2.1

In Service Mesh 2.1, the Mixer component is removed. Bug fixes and support is provided through the end of the Service Mesh 2.0 life cycle.

Upgrading from a Service Mesh 2.0.x release to 2.1 will not proceed if Mixer plugins are enabled. Mixer plugins must be ported to WebAssembly Extensions.

## Deprecated features in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh 2.0

The Mixer component was deprecated in release 2.0 and will be removed in release 2.1. While using Mixer for implementing extensions was still supported in release 2.0, extensions should have been migrated to the new WebAssembly mechanism.

The following resource types are no longer supported in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh 2.0:

* Policy (authentication.istio.io/v1alpha1) is no longer supported. Depending on the specific configuration in your Policy resource, you may have to configure multiple resources to achieve the same effect.
* Use RequestAuthentication (security.istio.io/v1beta1)
* Use PeerAuthentication (security.istio.io/v1beta1)
* ServiceMeshPolicy (maistra.io/v1) is no longer supported.
* Use RequestAuthentication or PeerAuthentication, as mentioned above, but place in the Service Mesh control plane namespace.
* RbacConfig (rbac.istio.io/v1alpha1) is no longer supported.
* Replaced by AuthorizationPolicy (security.istio.io/v1beta1), which encompasses behavior of RbacConfig, ServiceRole, and ServiceRoleBinding.
* ServiceMeshRbacConfig (maistra.io/v1) is no longer supported.
* Use AuthorizationPolicy as above, but place in Service Mesh control plane namespace.
* ServiceRole (rbac.istio.io/v1alpha1) is no longer supported.
* ServiceRoleBinding (rbac.istio.io/v1alpha1) is no longer supported.
* In Kiali, the login and LDAP strategies are deprecated. A future version will introduce authentication using OpenID providers.

# Known issues

These limitations exist in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh:

* Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh does not yet fully support IPv6. As a result, Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh does not support dual-stack clusters.
* Graph layout - The layout for the Kiali graph can render differently, depending on your application architecture and the data to display (number of graph nodes and their interactions). Because it is difficult if not impossible to create a single layout that renders nicely for every situation, Kiali offers a choice of several different layouts. To choose a different layout, you can choose a different Layout Schema from the Graph Settings menu.
* The first time you access related services such as Distributed Tracing Platform (Jaeger) and Grafana, from the Kiali console, you must accept the certificate and re-authenticate using your {product-title} login credentials. This happens due to an issue with how the framework displays embedded pages in the console.
* The Bookinfo sample application cannot be installed on IBM Power(R), IBM Z(R), and IBM(R) LinuxONE.
* WebAssembly extensions are not supported on IBM Power(R), IBM Z(R), and IBM(R) LinuxONE.
* LuaJIT is not supported on IBM Power(R), IBM Z(R), and IBM(R) LinuxONE.
* Single stack IPv6 support is not available on IBM Power(R), IBM Z(R), and IBM(R) LinuxONE.

## Service Mesh known issues

These are the known issues in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh:
* OSSM-5556 Gateways are skipped when istio-system labels do not match discovery selectors.

+
Workaround: Label the control plane namespace to match discovery selectors to avoid skipping the Gateway configurations.

+
.Example ServiceMeshControlPlane resource


```YAML
apiVersion: maistra.io/v2
kind: ServiceMeshControlPlane
metadata:
  name: basic
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  mode: ClusterWide
  meshConfig:
    discoverySelectors:
    - matchLabels:
        istio-discovery: enabled
  gateways:
    ingress:
      enabled: true
```


+
Then, run the following command at the command line:

+


```terminal
oc label namespace istio-system istio-discovery=enabled
```


* OSSM-3890 Attempting to use the Gateway API in a multitenant mesh deployment generates an error message similar to the following:

```text
2023-05-02T15:20:42.541034Z	error	watch error in cluster Kubernetes: failed to list *v1alpha2.TLSRoute: the server could not find the requested resource (get tlsroutes.gateway.networking.k8s.io)
2023-05-02T15:20:42.616450Z	info	kube	controller "gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2/TCPRoute" is syncing...
```


To support Gateway API in a multitenant mesh deployment, all Gateway API Custom Resource Definition (CRD) files must be present in the cluster.

In a multitenant mesh deployment, CRD scan is disabled, and Istio has no way to discover which CRDs are present in a cluster. As a result, Istio attempts to watch all supported Gateway API CRDs, but generates errors if some of those CRDs are not present.

Service Mesh 2.3.1 and later versions support both v1alpha2 and v1beta1 CRDs. Therefore, both CRD versions must be present for a multitenant mesh deployment to support the Gateway API.

Workaround: In the following example, the kubectl get operation installs the v1alpha2 and v1beta1 CRDs. Note the URL contains the additional experimental segment and updates any of your existing scripts accordingly:

```terminal
$ kubectl get crd gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io ||   { kubectl kustomize "github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/config/crd/experimental?ref=v0.5.1" | kubectl apply -f -; }
```

* OSSM-2042 Deployment of SMCP named default fails. If you are creating an SMCP object, and set its version field to v2.3, the name of the object cannot be default. If the name is default, then the control plane fails to deploy, and OpenShift generates a Warning event with the following message:

Error processing component mesh-config: error: [mesh-config/templates/telemetryv2_1.6.yaml: Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "rev.validation.istio.io": Post "https://istiod-default.istio-system.svc:443/validate?timeout=10s": x509: certificate is valid for istiod.istio-system.svc, istiod-remote.istio-system.svc, istio-pilot.istio-system.svc, not istiod-default.istio-system.svc, mesh-config/templates/enable-mesh-permissive.yaml

* OSSM-1655 Kiali dashboard shows error after enabling mTLS in SMCP.

After enabling the spec.security.controlPlane.mtls setting in the SMCP, the Kiali console displays the following error message No subsets defined.
* OSSM-1505 This issue only occurs when using the ServiceMeshExtension resource on OpenShift Container Platform 4.11. When you use ServiceMeshExtension on OpenShift Container Platform 4.11 the resource never becomes ready. If you inspect the issue using oc describe ServiceMeshExtension you will see the following error:  stderr: Error creating mount namespace before pivot: function not implemented.

Workaround: ServiceMeshExtension was deprecated in Service Mesh 2.2. Migrate from ServiceMeshExtension to the WasmPlugin resource.
For more information, see Migrating from ServiceMeshExtension to WasmPlugin resources.
* OSSM-1396 If a gateway resource contains the spec.externalIPs setting, instead of being recreated when the ServiceMeshControlPlane is updated, the gateway is removed and never recreated.
* OSSM-1168 When service mesh resources are created as a single YAML file, the Envoy proxy sidecar is not reliably injected into pods. When the SMCP, SMMR, and Deployment resources are created individually, the deployment works as expected.
* OSSM-1115 The concurrency field of the spec.proxy API did not propagate to the istio-proxy. The concurrency field works when set with ProxyConfig. The concurrency field specifies the number of worker threads to run. If the field is set to 0, then the number of worker threads available is equal to the number of CPU cores. If the field is not set, then the number of worker threads available defaults to 2.

In the following example, the concurrency field is set to 0.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: ProxyConfig
metadata:
  name: mesh-wide-concurrency
  namespace: <istiod-namespace>
spec:
  concurrency: 0
```

* OSSM-1052 When configuring a Service ExternalIP for the ingressgateway in the Service Mesh control plane, the service is not created. The schema for the SMCP is missing the parameter for the service.

Workaround: Disable the gateway creation in the SMCP spec and manage the gateway deployment entirely manually (including Service, Role and RoleBinding).

* OSSM-882 This applies for Service Mesh 2.1 and earlier. Namespace is in the accessible_namespace list but does not appear in Kiali UI. By default, Kiali will not show any namespaces that start with "kube" because these namespaces are typically internal-use only and not part of a mesh.

For example, if you create a namespace called 'akube-a' and add it to the Service Mesh member roll, then the Kiali UI does not display the namespace. For defined exclusion patterns, the software excludes namespaces that start with or contain the pattern.

Workaround: Change the Kiali Custom Resource setting so it prefixes the setting with a carat (^). For example:

```yaml
api:
  namespaces:
    exclude:
    - "^istio-operator"
    - "^kube-.*"
    - "^openshift.*"
    - "^ibm.*"
    - "^kiali-operator"
```

* MAISTRA-2692 With Mixer removed, custom metrics that have been defined in Service Mesh 2.0.x cannot be used in 2.1. Custom metrics can be configured using EnvoyFilter. Red Hat is unable to support EnvoyFilter configuration except where explicitly documented. This is due to tight coupling with the underlying Envoy APIs, meaning that backward compatibility cannot be maintained.
* MAISTRA-2648 Service mesh extensions are currently not compatible with meshes deployed on IBM Z(R).
* MAISTRA-1959 Migration to 2.0 Prometheus scraping (spec.addons.prometheus.scrape set to true) does not work when mTLS is enabled. Additionally, Kiali displays extraneous graph data when mTLS is disabled.

This problem can be addressed by excluding port 15020 from proxy configuration, for example,

```yaml
spec:
  proxy:
    networking:
      trafficControl:
        inbound:
          excludedPorts:
          - 15020
```

* MAISTRA-453 If you create a new project and deploy pods immediately, sidecar injection does not occur. The operator fails to add the maistra.io/member-of before the pods are created, therefore the pods must be deleted and recreated for sidecar injection to occur.
* MAISTRA-158 Applying multiple gateways referencing the same hostname will cause all gateways to stop functioning.

## Kiali known issues


[NOTE]
----
New issues for Kiali should be created in the OpenShift Service Mesh project with the Component set to Kiali.
----

These are the known issues in Kiali:

* OSSM-6299 In {product-title} 4.15, when you click the Node graph menu option of any node menu within the traffic graph, the node graph is not displayed. Instead, the page is refreshed with the same traffic graph. Currently, no workaround exists for this issue.
* OSSM-6298 When you click an item reference within the OpenShift Service Mesh Console (OSSMC) plugin, such as a workload link related to a specific service, the console sometimes performs multiple redirections before opening the desired page. If you click Back in a web browser, a different page of the console opens instead of the previous page. As a workaround, click Back twice to navigate to the previous page.
* OSSM-6290 For {product-title} 4.15, the Project filter of the Istio Config list page does not work correctly. All istio items are displayed even if you select a specific project from the dropdown. Currently, no workaround exists for this issue.

* KIALI-2206 When you are accessing the Kiali console for the first time, and there is no cached browser data for Kiali, the “View in Grafana” link on the Metrics tab of the Kiali Service Details page redirects to the wrong location. The only way you would encounter this issue is if you are accessing Kiali for the first time.
* KIALI-507 Kiali does not support Internet Explorer 11. This is because the underlying frameworks do not support Internet Explorer. To access the Kiali console, use one of the two most recent versions of the Chrome, Edge, Firefox or Safari browser.

# Fixed issues

The following issues have been resolved in previous releases:

## Service Mesh fixed issues

* OSSM-6177 Previously, when validation messages were enabled in the ServiceMeshControlPlane (SMCP), the istiod crashed continuously unless GatewayAPI support was enabled. Now, when validation messages are enabled but GatewayAPI support is not, the istiod does not continuously crash.
* OSSM-6163 Resolves the following issues:
* Previously, an unstable Prometheus image was included in the Service Mesh control plane (SMCP) v2.5, and users were not able to access the Prometheus dashboard. Now, in the Service Mesh operator 2.5.1, the Prometheus image has been updated.
* Previously, in the Service Mesh control plane (SMCP), a Grafana data source was not able to set Basic authentication password automatically and users were not able to view metrics from Prometheus in Grafana mesh dashboards. Now, a Grafana data source password is configured under the secureJsonData field. Metrics are displayed correctly in dashboards.
* OSSM-6148 Previously, the OpenShift Service Mesh Console (OSSMC) plugin did not respond when the user clicked any option in the menu of any node on the Traffic Graph page. Now, the plugin responds to the selected option in the menu by redirecting to the corresponding details page.
* OSSM-6099 Previously, the OpenShift Service Mesh Console (OSSMC) plugin failed to load correctly in an IPv6 cluster. Now, the OSSMC plugin configuration has been modified to ensure proper loading in an IPv6 cluster.
* OSSM-5960 Previously, the OpenShift Service Mesh Console (OSSMC) plugin did not display notification messages such as backend errors or Istio validations. Now, these notifications are displayed correctly at the top of the plugin page.
* OSSM-5959 Previously, the OpenShift Service Mesh Console (OSSMC) plugin did not display TLS and Istio certification information in the Overview page. Now, this information is displayed correctly.
* OSSM-5902 Previously, the OpenShift Service Mesh Console (OSSMC) plugin redirected to a "Not Found Page" error when the user clicked the Istio config health symbol on the Overview page. Now, the plugin redirects to the correct Istio config details page.
* OSSM-5541 Previously, an Istio operator pod might keep waiting for the leader lease in some restart conditions. Now, the leader election implementation has been enhanced to avoid this issue.
* OSSM-1397 Previously, if you removed the maistra.io/member-of label from a namespace, the Service Mesh Operator did not automatically reapply the label to the namespace. As a result, sidecar injection did not work in the namespace.

The Operator would reapply the label to the namespace when you made changes to the ServiceMeshMember object, which triggered the reconciliation of this member object.

Now, any change to the namespace also triggers the member object reconciliation.
* OSSM-3647 Previously, in the Service Mesh control plane (SMCP) v2.2 (Istio 1.12), WasmPlugins were applied only to inbound listeners. Since SMCP v2.3 (Istio 1.14), WasmPlugins have been applied to inbound and outbound listeners by default, which introduced regression for users of the 3scale WasmPlugin. Now, the environment variable APPLY_WASM_PLUGINS_TO_INBOUND_ONLY is added, which allows safe migration from SMCP v2.2 to v2.3 and v2.4.

The following setting should be added to the SMCP config:

```yaml
spec:
  runtime:
    components:
      pilot:
        container:
          env:
            APPLY_WASM_PLUGINS_TO_INBOUND_ONLY: "true"
```


To ensure safe migration, perform the following steps:
1. Set APPLY_WASM_PLUGINS_TO_INBOUND_ONLY in SMCP v2.2.
2. Upgrade to 2.4.
3. Set spec.match[].mode: SERVER in WasmPlugins.
4. Remove the previously-added environment variable.
* OSSM-4851 Previously, an error occurred in the operator deploying new pods in a namespace scoped inside the mesh when runAsGroup, runAsUser, or fsGroup parameters were nil. Now, a yaml validation has been added to avoid the nil value.
* OSSM-3771 Previously, OpenShift routes could not be disabled for additional ingress gateways defined in a Service Mesh Control Plane (SMCP). Now, a routeConfig block can be added to each additionalIngress gateway so the creation of OpenShift routes can be enabled or disabled for each gateway.
* OSSM-4197 Previously, if you deployed a v2.2 or v2.1 of the 'ServiceMeshControlPlane' resource, the /etc/cni/multus/net.d/ directory was not created. As a result, the istio-cni pod failed to become ready, and the istio-cni pods log contained the following message:

```terminal
$ error   Installer exits with open /host/etc/cni/multus/net.d/v2-2-istio-cni.kubeconfig.tmp.841118073: no such file or directory
```


Now, if you deploy a v2.2 or v2.1 of the 'ServiceMeshControlPlane' resource, the /etc/cni/multus/net.d/ directory is created, and the istio-cni pod becomes ready.
* OSSM-3993 Previously, Kiali only supported OpenShift OAuth via a proxy on the standard HTTPS port of 443. Now, Kiali supports OpenShift OAuth over a non-standard HTTPS port. To enable the port, you must set the spec.server.web_port field to the proxy's non-standard HTTPS port in the Kiali CR.
* OSSM-3936 Previously, the values for the injection_label_rev and injection_label_name attributes were hardcoded. This prevented custom configurations from taking effect in the Kiali Custom Resource Definition (CRD). Now, the attribute values are not hardcoded. You can customize the values for the injection_label_rev and injection_label_name attributes in the spec.istio_labels specification.
* OSSM-3644 Previously, the federation egress-gateway received the wrong update of network gateway endpoints, causing extra endpoint entries. Now, the federation-egress gateway has been updated on the server side so it receives the correct network gateway endpoints.
* OSSM-3595 Previously, the istio-cni plugin sometimes failed on RHEL because SELinux did not allow the utility iptables-restore to open files in the /tmp directory. Now, SELinux passes iptables-restore via stdin input stream instead of via a file.
* OSSM-3586 Previously, Istio proxies were slow to start when Google Cloud Platform (GCP) metadata servers were not available. When you upgrade to Istio 1.14.6, Istio proxies start as expected on GCP, even if metadata servers are not available.
* OSSM-3025 Istiod sometimes fails to become ready. Sometimes, when a mesh contained many member namespaces, the Istiod pod did not become ready due to a deadlock within Istiod. The deadlock is now resolved and the pod now starts as expected.
* OSSM-2493 Default nodeSelector and tolerations in SMCP not passed to Kiali. The nodeSelector and tolerations you add to SMCP.spec.runtime.defaults are now passed to the Kiali resource.
* OSSM-2492 Default tolerations in SMCP not passed to Jaeger. The nodeSelector and tolerations you add to SMCP.spec.runtime.defaults are now passed to the Jaeger resource.
* OSSM-2374 If you deleted one of the ServiceMeshMember resources, then the Service Mesh operator deleted the ServiceMeshMemberRoll. While this is expected behavior when you delete the last ServiceMeshMember, the operator should not delete the ServiceMeshMemberRoll if it contains any members in addition to the one that was deleted. This issue is now fixed and the operator only deletes the ServiceMeshMemberRoll when the last ServiceMeshMember resource is deleted.
* OSSM-2373 Error trying to get OAuth metadata when logging in. To fetch the cluster version, the system:anonymous account is used. With the cluster's default bundled ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBinding, the anonymous account can fetch the version correctly. If the system:anonymous account loses its privileges to fetch the cluster version, OpenShift authentication becomes unusable.

This is fixed by using the Kiali SA to fetch the cluster version. This also allows for improved security on the cluster.
* OSSM-2371 Despite Kiali being configured as "view-only," a user can change the proxy logging level via the Workload details' Logs tab's kebab menu. This issue has been fixed so the options under "Set Proxy Log Level" are disabled when Kiali is configured as "view-only."
* OSSM-2344 Restarting Istiod causes Kiali to flood CRI-O with port-forward requests. This issue occurred when Kiali could not connect to Istiod and Kiali simultaneously issued a large number of requests to istiod. Kiali now limits the number of requests it sends to istiod.
* OSSM-2335 Dragging the mouse pointer over the Traces scatterchart plot sometimes caused the Kiali console to stop responding due to concurrent backend requests.
* OSSM-2221 Previously, gateway injection in the ServiceMeshControlPlane namespace was not possible because the ignore-namespace label was applied to the namespace by default.

When creating a v2.4 control plane, the namespace no longer has the ignore-namespace label applied, and gateway injection is possible.

In the following example, the oc label command removes the ignore-namespace label from a namespace in an existing deployment:

```terminal
$ oc label namespace istio-system maistra.io/ignore-namespace-
```


where:
istio_system:: Specified the name of the ServiceMeshControlPlane namespace.
* OSSM-2053 Using Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator 2.2 or 2.3, during SMCP reconciliation, the SMMR controller removed the member namespaces from SMMR.status.configuredMembers. This caused the services in the member namespaces to become unavailable for a few moments.

Using Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator 2.2 or 2.3, the SMMR controller no longer removes the namespaces from SMMR.status.configuredMembers. Instead, the controller adds the namespaces to SMMR.status.pendingMembers to indicate that they are not up-to-date. During reconciliation, as each namespace synchronizes with the SMCP, the namespace is automatically removed from SMMR.status.pendingMembers.
* OSSM-1962 Use EndpointSlices in federation controller. The federation controller now uses EndpointSlices, which improves scalability and performance in large deployments. The PILOT_USE_ENDPOINT_SLICE flag is enabled by default. Disabling the flag prevents use of federation deployments.
* OSSM-1668 A new field spec.security.jwksResolverCA was added to the Version 2.1 SMCP but was missing in the 2.2.0 and 2.2.1 releases. When upgrading from an Operator version where this field was present to an Operator version that was missing this field, the .spec.security.jwksResolverCA field was not available in the SMCP.
* OSSM-1325 istiod pod crashes and displays the following error message: fatal error: concurrent map iteration and map write.
* OSSM-1211
Configuring Federated service meshes for failover does not work as expected.

The Istiod pilot log displays the following error: envoy connection [C289] TLS error: 337047686:SSL routines:tls_process_server_certificate:certificate verify failed
* OSSM-1099
The Kiali console displayed the message Sorry, there was a problem. Try a refresh or navigate to a different page.
* OSSM-1074
Pod annotations defined in SMCP are not injected in the pods.
* OSSM-999
Kiali retention did not work as expected. Calendar times were greyed out in the dashboard graph.
* OSSM-797 Kiali Operator pod generates CreateContainerConfigError while installing or updating the operator.
* OSSM-722
Namespace starting with kube is hidden from Kiali.
* OSSM-569 There is no CPU memory limit for the Prometheus istio-proxy container. The Prometheus istio-proxy sidecar now uses the resource limits defined in spec.proxy.runtime.container.
* OSSM-535 Support validationMessages in SMCP. The ValidationMessages field in the Service Mesh Control Plane can now be set to True. This writes a log for the status of the resources, which can be helpful when troubleshooting problems.
* OSSM-449 VirtualService and Service causes an error "Only unique values for domains are permitted. Duplicate entry of domain."
* OSSM-419 Namespaces with similar names will all show in Kiali namespace list, even though namespaces may not be defined in Service Mesh Member Role.
* OSSM-296 When adding health configuration to the Kiali custom resource (CR) is it not being replicated to the Kiali configmap.
* OSSM-291 In the Kiali console, on the Applications, Services, and Workloads pages, the "Remove Label from Filters" function is not working.
* OSSM-289 In the Kiali console, on the Service Details pages for the 'istio-ingressgateway' and 'jaeger-query' services there are no Traces being displayed. The traces exist in Jaeger.
* OSSM-287 In the Kiali console there are no traces being displayed on the Graph Service.
* OSSM-285 When trying to access the Kiali console, receive the following error message "Error trying to get OAuth Metadata".

Workaround: Restart the Kiali pod.
* MAISTRA-2735 The resources that the Service Mesh Operator deletes when reconciling the SMCP changed in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh version 2.1. Previously, the Operator deleted a resource with the following labels:
* maistra.io/owner
* app.kubernetes.io/version

Now, the Operator ignores resources that does not also include the app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=maistra-istio-operator label. If you create your own resources, you should not add the app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=maistra-istio-operator label to them.
* MAISTRA-2687 Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh 2.1 federation gateway does not send the full certificate chain when using external certificates. The Service Mesh federation egress gateway only sends the client certificate. Because the federation ingress gateway only knows about the root certificate, it cannot verify the client certificate unless you add the root certificate to the federation import ConfigMap.
* MAISTRA-2635 Replace deprecated Kubernetes API. To remain compatible with {product-title} 4.8, the apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1 API was deprecated as of Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh 2.0.8.
* MAISTRA-2631 The WASM feature is not working because podman is failing due to nsenter binary not being present. Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh generates the following error message: Error: error configuring CNI network plugin exec: "nsenter": executable file not found in $PATH. The container image now contains nsenter and WASM works as expected.
* MAISTRA-2534 When istiod attempted to fetch the JWKS for an issuer specified in a JWT rule, the issuer service responded with a 502.  This prevented the proxy container from becoming ready and caused deployments to hang. The fix for the community bug has been included in the  Service Mesh 2.0.7 release.
* MAISTRA-2411 When the Operator creates a new ingress gateway using spec.gateways.additionaIngress in the ServiceMeshControlPlane, Operator is not creating a NetworkPolicy for the additional ingress gateway like it does for the default istio-ingressgateway. This is causing a 503 response from the route of the new gateway.

Workaround: Manually create the NetworkPolicy in the istio-system namespace.
* MAISTRA-2401 CVE-2021-3586 servicemesh-operator: NetworkPolicy resources incorrectly specified ports for ingress resources. The NetworkPolicy resources installed for Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh did not properly specify which ports could be accessed. This allowed access to all ports on these resources from any pod. Network policies applied to the following resources are affected:
* Galley
* Grafana
* Istiod
* Jaeger
* Kiali
* Prometheus
* Sidecar injector
* MAISTRA-2378 When the cluster is configured to use OpenShift SDN with ovs-multitenant and the mesh contains a large number of namespaces (200+), the {product-title} networking plugin is unable to configure the namespaces quickly. Service Mesh times out causing namespaces to be continuously dropped from the service mesh and then reenlisted.
* MAISTRA-2370 Handle tombstones in listerInformer. The updated cache codebase was not handling tombstones when translating the events from the namespace caches to the aggregated cache, leading to a panic in the go routine.
* MAISTRA-2117 Add optional ConfigMap mount to operator. The CSV now contains an optional ConfigMap volume mount, which mounts the smcp-templates ConfigMap if it exists. If the smcp-templates ConfigMap does not exist, the mounted directory is empty. When you create the ConfigMap, the directory is populated with the entries from the ConfigMap and can be referenced in SMCP.spec.profiles. No restart of the Service Mesh operator is required.

Customers using the 2.0 operator with a modified CSV to mount the smcp-templates ConfigMap can upgrade to Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh 2.1. After upgrading, you can continue using an existing ConfigMap, and the profiles it contains, without editing the CSV. Customers that previously used ConfigMap with a different name will either have to rename the ConfigMap or update the CSV after upgrading.
* MAISTRA-2010 AuthorizationPolicy does not support request.regex.headers field. The validatingwebhook rejects any AuthorizationPolicy with the field, and even if you disable that, Pilot tries to validate it using the same code, and it does not work.
* MAISTRA-1979 Migration to 2.0 The conversion webhook drops the following important fields when converting SMCP.status from v2 to v1:
* conditions
* components
* observedGeneration
* annotations

Upgrading the operator to 2.0 might break client tools that read the SMCP status using the maistra.io/v1 version of the resource.

This also causes the READY and STATUS columns to be empty when you run oc get servicemeshcontrolplanes.v1.maistra.io.
* MAISTRA-1947 Technology Preview Updates to ServiceMeshExtensions are not applied.

Workaround: Remove and recreate the ServiceMeshExtensions.
* MAISTRA-1983 Migration to 2.0 Upgrading to 2.0.0 with an existing invalid ServiceMeshControlPlane cannot easily be repaired. The invalid items in the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource caused an unrecoverable error. The fix makes the errors recoverable. You can delete the invalid resource and replace it with a new one or edit the resource to fix the errors. For more information about editing your resource, see [Configuring the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh installation].
* MAISTRA-1502 As a result of CVEs fixes in version 1.0.10, the Istio dashboards are not available from the Home Dashboard menu in Grafana. To access the Istio dashboards, click the Dashboard menu in the navigation panel and select the Manage tab.
* MAISTRA-1399 Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh no longer prevents you from installing unsupported CNI protocols. The supported network configurations has not changed.
* MAISTRA-1089 Migration to 2.0 Gateways created in a non-control plane namespace are automatically deleted. After removing the gateway definition from the SMCP spec, you need to manually delete these resources.
* MAISTRA-858 The following Envoy log messages describing deprecated options and configurations associated with Istio 1.1.x are expected:
* [2019-06-03 07:03:28.943][19][warning][misc] [external/envoy/source/common/protobuf/utility.cc:129] Using deprecated option 'envoy.api.v2.listener.Filter.config'. This configuration will be removed from Envoy soon.
* [2019-08-12 22:12:59.001][13][warning][misc] [external/envoy/source/common/protobuf/utility.cc:174] Using deprecated option 'envoy.api.v2.Listener.use_original_dst' from file lds.proto. This configuration will be removed from Envoy soon.
* MAISTRA-806 Evicted Istio Operator Pod causes mesh and CNI not to deploy.

Workaround: If the istio-operator pod is evicted while deploying the control pane, delete the evicted istio-operator pod.
* MAISTRA-681 When the Service Mesh control plane has many namespaces, it can lead to performance issues.
* MAISTRA-193 Unexpected console info messages are visible when health checking is enabled for citadel.
* Bugzilla 1821432 The toggle controls in {product-title} Custom Resource details page does not update the CR correctly. UI Toggle controls in the Service Mesh Control Plane (SMCP) Overview page in the {product-title} web console sometimes updates the wrong field in the resource. To update a SMCP, edit the YAML content directly or update the resource from the command line instead of clicking the toggle controls.
