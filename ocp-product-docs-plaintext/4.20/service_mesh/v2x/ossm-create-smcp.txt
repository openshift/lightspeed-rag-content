# Creating the ServiceMeshControlPlane



# About ServiceMeshControlPlane

The control plane includes Istiod, Ingress and Egress Gateways, and other components, such as Kiali and Jaeger. The control plane must be deployed in a separate namespace than the Service Mesh Operators and the data plane applications and services. You can deploy a basic installation of the ServiceMeshControlPlane(SMCP) from the {product-title} web console or the command line using the oc client tool.


[NOTE]
----
This basic installation is configured based on the default {product-title} settings and is not designed for production use. Use this default installation to verify your installation, and then configure your ServiceMeshControlPlane settings for your environment.
----


[NOTE]
----
The Service Mesh documentation uses istio-system as the example project, but you can deploy the service mesh to any project.

## Deploying the Service Mesh control plane from the web console

You can deploy a basic ServiceMeshControlPlane by using the web console.  In this example, istio-system is the name of the Service Mesh control plane project.

* The Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator must be installed.
* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console as cluster-admin.

1. Log in to the {product-title} web console as a user with the cluster-admin role. If you use Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated, you must have an account with the dedicated-admin role.
2. Create a project named istio-system.
1. Navigate to Home -> Projects.
2. Click Create Project.
3. In the Name field, enter istio-system. The ServiceMeshControlPlane resource must be installed in a project that is separate from your microservices and Operators.

These steps use istio-system as an example, but you can deploy your Service Mesh control plane in any project as long as it is separate from the project that contains your services.
4. Click Create.
3. Navigate to Ecosystem -> Installed Operators.
4. Click the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator, then click Istio Service Mesh Control Plane.
5. On the Istio Service Mesh Control Plane tab, click Create ServiceMeshControlPlane.
1. Accept the default Service Mesh control plane version to take advantage of the features available in the most current version of the product. The version of the control plane determines the features available regardless of the version of the Operator.
2. Click Create.

The Operator creates pods, services, and Service Mesh control plane components based on your configuration parameters. You can configure ServiceMeshControlPlane settings at a later time.

* To verify the control plane installed correctly, click the Istio Service Mesh Control Plane tab.
1. Click the name of the new control plane.
2. Click the Resources tab to see the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh control plane resources the Operator created and configured.

## Deploying the Service Mesh control plane using the CLI

You can deploy a basic ServiceMeshControlPlane from the command line.

* The Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator must be installed.
* Access to the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You are logged in to {product-title} as`cluster-admin`.

1. Create a project named istio-system.

```terminal
$ oc new-project istio-system
```

2. Create a ServiceMeshControlPlane file named istio-installation.yaml using the following example. The version of the Service Mesh control plane determines the features available regardless of the version of the Operator.
Example version 2.6 istio-installation.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: maistra.io/v2
kind: ServiceMeshControlPlane
metadata:
  name: basic
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  version: v2.6
  tracing:
    type: None
    sampling: 10000
  addons:
    kiali:
      enabled: true
      name: kiali
    grafana:
      enabled: true
```

3. Run the following command to deploy the Service Mesh control plane, where <istio_installation.yaml> includes the full path to your file.

```terminal
$ oc create -n istio-system -f <istio_installation.yaml>
```

4. To watch the progress of the pod deployment, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get pods -n istio-system -w
```


You should see output similar to the following:

```terminal
NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
grafana-b4d59bd7-mrgbr                 2/2     Running   0          65m

# About control plane and cluster-wide deployments

A cluster-wide deployment contains a Service Mesh Control Plane that monitors resources for an entire cluster. Monitoring resources for an entire cluster closely resembles Istio functionality in that the control plane uses a single query across all namespaces to monitor Istio and Kubernetes resources. As a result, cluster-wide deployments decrease the number of requests sent to the API server.

You can configure the Service Mesh Control Plane for cluster-wide deployments using either the {product-title} web console or the CLI.

## Configuring the control plane for cluster-wide deployment with the web console

You can configure the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource for cluster-wide deployment using the {product-title} web console. In this example, istio-system is the name of the Service Mesh control plane project.

* The Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator is installed.
* You are logged in to {product-title} as`cluster-admin`.

1. Create a project named istio-system.
1. Navigate to Home -> Projects.
2. Click Create Project.
3. In the Name field, enter istio-system. The ServiceMeshControlPlane resource must be installed in a project that is separate from your microservices and Operators.

These steps use istio-system as an example. You can deploy the Service Mesh control plane to any project as long as it is separate from the project that contains your services.
4. Click Create.
2. Navigate to Ecosystem -> Installed Operators.
3. Click the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator, then click Istio Service Mesh Control Plane.
4. On the Istio Service Mesh Control Plane tab, click Create ServiceMeshControlPlane.
5. Click YAML view. The version of the Service Mesh control plane determines the features available regardless of the version of the Operator.
6. Modify the spec.mode field of the YAML file to specify ClusterWide.
Example version 2.6 istio-installation.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: maistra.io/v2
kind: ServiceMeshControlPlane
metadata:
  name: basic
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  version: v2.6
  mode: ClusterWide
```

7. Click Create. The Operator creates pods, services, and Service Mesh control plane components based on your configuration parameters. The operator also creates the ServiceMeshMemberRoll if it does not exist as part of the default configuration.

* To verify that the control plane installed correctly:
1. Click the Istio Service Mesh Control Plane tab.
2. Click the name of the new ServiceMeshControlPlane object.
3. Click the Resources tab to see the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh control plane resources that the Operator created and configured.

## Configuring the control plane for cluster-wide deployment with the CLI

You can configure the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource for cluster-wide deployment using the CLI. In this example, istio-system is the name of the Service Mesh control plane namespace.

* The Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator is installed.
* You have access to the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You are logged in to {product-title} as`cluster-admin`.

1. Create a project named istio-system.

```terminal
$ oc new-project istio-system
```

2. Create a ServiceMeshControlPlane file named istio-installation.yaml using the following example:
Example version 2.6 istio-installation.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: maistra.io/v2
kind: ServiceMeshControlPlane
metadata:
  name: basic
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  version: v2.6
  mode: ClusterWide
```

3. Run the following command to deploy the Service Mesh control plane:

```terminal
$ oc create -n istio-system -f <istio_installation.yaml>
```


where:
<istio_installation.yaml>:: Specifies the full path to your file.

1. To monitor the progress of the pod deployment, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get pods -n istio-system -w
```


You should see output similar to the following example:
Example output

```terminal
NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

prometheus-58954b8d6b-m5std            2/2     Running   0          66m
```


## Customizing the member roll for a cluster-wide mesh

In cluster-wide mode, when you create the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource, the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource is also created. You can modify the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource after it gets created. After you modify the resource, the Service Mesh operator no longer changes it. If you modify the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource by using the {product-title} web console, accept the prompt to overwrite the modifications.

Alternatively, you can create a ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource before deploying the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource. When you create the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource, the Service Mesh Operator will not modify the ServiceMeshMemberRoll.


[NOTE]
----
The ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource name must be named default and must be created in the same project namespace as the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource.
----

There are two ways to add a namespace to the mesh. You can either add the namespace by specifying its name in the spec.members list, or configure a set of namespace label selectors to include or exclude namespaces based on their labels.


[NOTE]
----
Regardless of how members are specified in the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource, you can also add members to the mesh by creating the ServiceMeshMember resource in each namespace.
----

# Validating your SMCP installation with Kiali
