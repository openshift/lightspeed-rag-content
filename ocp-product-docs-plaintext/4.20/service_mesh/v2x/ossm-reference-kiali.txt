# Kiali configuration reference


When the Service Mesh Operator creates the ServiceMeshControlPlane it also processes the Kiali resource. The Kiali Operator then uses this object when creating Kiali instances.

# Specifying Kiali configuration in the SMCP

You can configure Kiali under the addons section of the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource. Kiali is enabled by default. To disable Kiali, set spec.addons.kiali.enabled to false.

You can specify your Kiali configuration in either of two ways:

* Specify the Kiali configuration in the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource under spec.addons.kiali.install. This approach has some limitations, because the complete list of Kiali configurations is not available in the SMCP.
* Configure and deploy a Kiali instance and specify the name of the Kiali resource as the value for spec.addons.kiali.name in the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource. You must create the CR in the same namespace as the Service Mesh control plane, for example, istio-system. If a Kiali resource matching the value of name exists, the control plane will configure that Kiali resource for use with the control plane. This approach lets you fully customize your Kiali configuration in the Kiali resource. Note that with this approach, various fields in the Kiali resource are overwritten by the Service Mesh Operator, specifically, the accessible_namespaces list, as well as the endpoints for Grafana, Prometheus, and tracing.


```yaml

    kiali:
      name: kiali
      enabled: true

          enableGrafana: true

          ingress:
            contextPath: /kiali
```




# Specifying Kiali configuration in a Kiali custom resource

You can fully customize your Kiali deployment by configuring Kiali in the Kiali custom resource (CR) rather than in the ServiceMeshControlPlane (SMCP) resource. This configuration is sometimes called an "external Kiali" since the configuration is specified outside of the SMCP.


[NOTE]
----
You must deploy the ServiceMeshControlPlane and Kiali custom resources in the same namespace. For example, istio-system.
----

You can configure and deploy a Kiali instance and then specify the name of the Kiali resource as the value for spec.addons.kiali.name in the SMCP resource. If a Kiali CR matching the value of name exists, the Service Mesh control plane will use the existing installation. This approach lets you fully customize your Kiali configuration.
