# Service Mesh overview

Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh also enhances security through features like mutual TLS, and offers observability with metrics, logging, and tracing to monitor and troubleshoot applications.


[NOTE]
----
Because Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh 3.0 releases on a different cadence from {product-title}, the Service Mesh documentation is available as a separate documentation set at Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh.
