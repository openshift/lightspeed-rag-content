# Troubleshooting builds


Use the following to troubleshoot build issues.

# Resolving denial for access to resources

If your request for access to resources is denied:

Issue:: A build fails with:


```terminal
requested access to the resource is denied
```


Resolution:: You have exceeded one of the image quotas set on your project. Check your current quota and verify the limits applied and storage in use:


```terminal
$ oc describe quota
```


# Service certificate generation failure

If your request for access to resources is denied:

Issue:: If a service certificate generation fails with (service's service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-generation-error annotation contains):


```terminal
secret/ssl-key references serviceUID 62ad25ca-d703-11e6-9d6f-0e9c0057b608, which does not match 77b6dd80-d716-11e6-9d6f-0e9c0057b60
```


Resolution:: The service that generated the certificate no longer exists, or has a different serviceUID. You must force certificates regeneration by removing the old secret, and clearing the following annotations on the service: service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-generation-error and service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-generation-error-num. To clear the annotations, enter the following commands:

```terminal
$ oc delete secret <secret_name>
```


```terminal
$ oc annotate service <service_name> service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-generation-error-
```


```terminal
$ oc annotate service <service_name> service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-generation-error-num-
```


[NOTE]
----
The command removing an annotation has a - after the annotation name to be
removed.
