# Build controller configuration parameters

The build.config.openshift.io/cluster resource offers the following configuration parameters.



# Configuring build settings

You can configure build settings by editing the build.config.openshift.io/cluster resource.

* Edit the build.config.openshift.io/cluster resource by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc edit build.config.openshift.io/cluster
```


The following is an example build.config.openshift.io/cluster resource:

Build: Holds cluster-wide information on how to handle builds. The canonical, and only valid name is cluster.
buildDefaults: Controls the default information for builds.
defaultProxy: Contains the default proxy settings for all build operations, including image pull or push and source download.
env: A set of default environment variables that are applied to the build if the specified variables do not exist on the build.
gitProxy: Contains the proxy settings for Git operations only. If set, this overrides any Proxy settings for all Git commands, such as git clone.
imageLabels: A list of labels that are applied to the resulting image.
You can override a default label by providing a label with the same name in the BuildConfig.
resources: Defines resource requirements to execute the build.
buildOverrides: Controls override settings for builds.
imageLabels: A list of labels that are applied to the resulting image.
If you provided a label in the BuildConfig with the same name as one in this table, your label will be overwritten.
nodeSelector: A selector which must be true for the build pod to fit on a node.
tolerations: A list of tolerations that overrides any existing tolerations set on a build pod.
