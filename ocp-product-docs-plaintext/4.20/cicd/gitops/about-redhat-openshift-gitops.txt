# About Red Hat OpenShift GitOps



Red Hat OpenShift GitOps is an Operator that uses Argo CD as the declarative GitOps engine. It enables GitOps workflows across multicluster OpenShift and Kubernetes infrastructure. Using Red Hat OpenShift GitOps, administrators can consistently configure and deploy Kubernetes-based infrastructure and applications across clusters and development lifecycles. Red Hat OpenShift GitOps is based on the open source project Argo CD and provides a similar set of features to what the upstream offers, with additional automation, integration into Red Hat {product-title} and the benefits of Red Hat&#8217;s enterprise support, quality assurance and focus on enterprise security.


[NOTE]
----
Because Red Hat OpenShift GitOps releases on a different cadence from {product-title}, the Red Hat OpenShift GitOps documentation is now available as a separate documentation set at Red Hat OpenShift GitOps.
