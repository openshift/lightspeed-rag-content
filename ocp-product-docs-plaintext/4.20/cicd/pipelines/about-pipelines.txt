# About Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines



Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines is a cloud-native, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) solution based on Kubernetes resources. It uses Tekton building blocks to automate deployments across multiple platforms by abstracting away the underlying implementation details. Tekton introduces a number of standard custom resource definitions (CRDs) for defining CI/CD pipelines that are portable across Kubernetes distributions.


[NOTE]
----
Because Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines releases on a different cadence from {product-title}, the Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines documentation is now available as a separate documentation set at Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines.
