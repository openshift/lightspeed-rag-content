# Overview of Builds



Builds is an extensible build framework based on the Shipwright project, which you can use to build container images on your {product-title} cluster. You can build container images from source code and Dockerfiles by using image build tools, such as Source-to-Image (S2I) and Buildah. You can create and apply build resources, view logs of build runs, and manage builds in your {product-title} namespaces.

Builds includes the following capabilities:

* Standard Kubernetes-native API for building container images from source code and Dockerfiles
* Support for Source-to-Image (S2I) and Buildah build strategies
* Extensibility with your own custom build strategies
* Execution of builds from source code in a local directory
* Shipwright CLI for creating and viewing logs, and managing builds on the cluster
* Integrated user experience with the Developer perspective of the {product-title} web console


[NOTE]
----
Because Builds releases on a different cadence from {product-title}, the Builds documentation is now available as a separate documentation set at Builds for Red Hat OpenShift.
