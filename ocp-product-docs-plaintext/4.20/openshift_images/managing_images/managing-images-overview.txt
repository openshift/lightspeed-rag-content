# Managing images overview



Image streams in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform provide a layer of abstraction over container images, enabling automation for your CI/CD pipelines. You can configure builds and deployments to watch image streams and automatically trigger new builds or deployments when images are updated.

The main advantage of using image streams is the automation they enable for your continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. For example:

* Image streams allow Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform resources like Builds and Deployments to "watch" them.
* When a new image is added to the stream, or when an existing tag is modified to point to a new image, the watching resources receive notifications.
* When notifications are received, the watching resources can automatically react by performing a new build or a new deployment.
