# Image pull policy


Each container in a pod has a container image. After you have created an image and pushed it to a registry, you can then refer to it in the pod.

# Image pull policy overview

When {product-title} creates containers, it uses the container imagePullPolicy to determine if the image should be pulled prior to starting the container. There are three possible values for imagePullPolicy:



If a container imagePullPolicy parameter is not specified, {product-title} sets it based on the image tag:

1. If the tag is latest, {product-title} defaults imagePullPolicy to Always.
2. Otherwise, {product-title} defaults imagePullPolicy to IfNotPresent.
