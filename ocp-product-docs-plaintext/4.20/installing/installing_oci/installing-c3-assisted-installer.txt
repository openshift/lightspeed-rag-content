# Installing a cluster on Oracle Compute Cloud@Customer by using the Assisted Installer


With Oracle(R) Compute Cloud@Customer (C3), you can run applications and middleware by using Oracle(R) Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) services on high performance cloud infrastructure in your data center.

# Overview

You can install {product-title} on Oracle Compute Cloud@Customer by using the Assisted Installer.

For an alternative installation method, see "Installing a cluster on Oracle&#174; Compute Cloud@Customer by using the Agent-based Installer".

* Ensure that your installation meets the prerequisites specified for Oracle. For details, see the "Access and Considerations" section in the Oracle documentation.
* Ensure that your infrastructure is certified and uses a compatible cloud instance type. For details, see Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
* Ensure that you are performing the installation on a virtual machine.

The installation process builds a bastion host within the designated compartment of the {product-title} cluster. The bastion host is used to run two Terraform scripts:

* The first script builds IAM Resources in the OCI Home region of the Compute Cloud@Customer system (two Dynamic Groups and one Policy).
* The second script builds the infrastructure resources on the Compute Cloud@Customer system to support the {product-title} cluster, including the {product-title} VCN, public and private subnets, load balancers, Internet GW, NAT GW, and DNS server. The script includes all the resources needed to activate the control plane nodes and compute nodes that form a cluster.

The bastion host is installed in the designated {product-title} Compartment and configured to communicate through a designated Compute Cloud@Customer DRG Subnet or Internet GW Subnet within the Compute Cloud@Customer parent tenancy.

The installation process subsequently provisions three control plane (master) nodes and three compute (worker) nodes, together with the external and internal Load Balancers that form the cluster. This is the standard implementation for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).

The main steps of the procedure are as follows:

1. Preparing the Compute Cloud@Customer bastion server.
2. Running the Terraform script via the Home region.
3. Preparing the {product-title} image for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).
4. Running the Terraform script via the Compute Cloud@Customer region.
5. Installing the cluster by using the Assisted Installer web console.

# Preparing the OCI bastion server

By implementing a bastion host, you can securely and efficiently manage access to your Oracle Compute Cloud@Customer resources, ensuring that your private instances remain protected and accessible only through a secure, controlled entry point.

* See the "Bastion server - prerequisites" section in the Oracle documentation.

1. Install the bastion server. For details, see the "Bastion Installation" section in the Oracle documentation.
2. Install the Terraform application which is used to run the Terraform script. For details, see the "Terraform Installation" section in the Oracle documentation.
3. Install and configure the OCI command-line interface (CLI). For details, see the "Installing and Configuring the OCI CLI" section in the Oracle documentation.

* Quick start - Installing the CLI (Oracle documentation).

# Running the Terraform script via the Home region

Copy the Terraform scripts createInfraResources.tf and terraform.tfvars onto the bastion server. Then run the createInfraResources.tf script to create the Dynamic Group Identity resources on your Compute Cloud@Customer OCI Home Region. These resources include dynamic groups, policies, and tags.

* You have tenancy privileges to create Dynamic Groups and Policies. If not, you can manually provision them during this procedure.

1. Connect to the bastion server via SSH.
2. Create OpenShift\createResourceOnHomeRegion folders.
3. Copy the createInfraResources.tf and terraform.tfvars files from the C3_PCA GitHub repository into the createResourceOnHomeRegion folder.
4. Ensure that you have access to the source environment, and that your C3 certificate has been exported.
5. Run the createInfraResources.tf Terraform script.

For the full procedure, see the "Terraform Script Execution Part-1 (Run Script via Home Region)" section in the Oracle documentation.

# Preparing the OCI image

Generate the {product-title} ISO image in the Assisted Installer on the Red&#160;Hat portal. Then, convert the image to an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) compatible image and upload it to the Custom Images page of your Oracle Compute Cloud@Customer environment.

You can generate, convert and upload the image on your laptop and not on the bastion server or within environments such as Oracle Solution Center.

## Generating the image in the Assisted Installer

Create a cluster and download the discovery ISO image.

1. Log in to Assisted Installer web console with your credentials.
2. In the Red Hat OpenShift tile, select OpenShift.
3. In the Red Hat {product-title} tile, select Create Cluster.
4. On the Cluster Type page, scroll to the end of the Cloud tab, and select Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (virtual machines).
5. On the Create an OpenShift Cluster page, select the Interactive tile.
6. On the Cluster Details page, complete the following fields:

7. Leave the default settings for the remaining fields, and click Next.
8. On the Operators page, click Next.
9. On the Host Discovery page, click Add hosts and complete the following steps:

[NOTE]
----
The minimal ISO image is the mandatory Provisioning type for the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), and cannot be changed.
----
1. In the SSH public key field, add the SSH public key by copying the output of the following command:

```terminal
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.put
```


The SSH public key will be installed on all {product-title} control plane and compute nodes.
2. Click the Show proxy settings checkbox.
3. Add the proxy variables from the /etc/environment file of the bastion server that you configured earlier:

```terminal
http_proxy=http://www-proxy.<your_domain>.com:80
https_proxy=http://www-proxy.<your_domain>.com:80
no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,.<your_domain>.com
#(ie.oracle.com,.oraclecorp.com)
```

4. Click Generate Discovery ISO to generate the discovery ISO image file.
10. Click Download Discovery ISO to save the file to your local system. After you download the ISO file, you can rename it as required, for example discovery_image_<your_cluster_name>.iso.

## Converting and uploading the image to Oracle Compute Cloud@Customer

Convert the ISO image to an OCI image and upload it to your Compute Cloud@Customer system from your OCI Home Region Object
Store.

1. Convert the image from ISO to OCI.
2. Upload the OCI image to an OCI bucket, and generate a Pre-Authenticated Request (PAR) URL.
3. Import the OCI image to the Compute Cloud@Customer portal.
4. Copy the Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID) of the image for use in the next procedure.

For the full procedure, see step 6 - 8 in the "OpenShift Image Preparation" section of the Oracle documentation.

# Running the Terraform script via the C3 region

Run the terraform.tfvars Terraform script to create all infrastructure resources on Compute Cloud@Customer. These resources include the {product-title} VCN, public and private subnets, load balancers, internet GW, NAT GW, and DNS server.

This procedure deploys a cluster consisting of three control plane (master) and three compute (worker) nodes. After deployment, you must rename and reboot the nodes. This process temporarily duplicates nodes, requiring manual cleanup in the next procedure.

1. Connect to the bastion server via SSH.
2. Set the C3 Certificate location and export the certificate.
3. Run the terraform.tfvars script to create three control plane nodes and three compute nodes.
4. Update the labels for the control plane and compute nodes.
5. Stop and restart the instances one by one on the Compute Cloud@Customer portal.

For the full procedure, see the "Terraform Script Execution - Part 2" section in the Oracle documentation.

# Completing the installation by using the Assisted Installer web console

After you configure the infrastructure, the instances are now running and are ready to be registered with&#160;Red Hat.

## Assigning node roles

If the Terraform scripts completed successfully, twelve hosts are now listed for the cluster. Three control plane hosts and three compute hosts have the status "Disconnected". Three control plane hosts and three compute hosts have the status "Insufficient".

Delete the disconnected hosts and assign roles to the remaining hosts.

1. From the Assisted Installer web console, select the cluster and navigate to the Host discovery page.
2. Delete the six hosts with a "Disconnected" status, by clicking the option button for each host and selecting Remove host. The status of the remaining hosts changes from "Insufficient" to "Ready". This process can take up to three minutes.
3. From the Role column, assign the Control plane role to the three nodes with a boot size of 1.10 TB. Assign the Worker role to the three nodes with boot size of 100 GB.
4. Rename any hosts with a name shorter than 63 characters, by clicking the option button for the host and selecting Change hostname. Otherwise the cluster installation will fail.
5. Click Next.
6. On the Storage page, click Next.

## Configuring networking

On the Networking page, add the NTP sources for any hosts that display the Some validations failed status.

1. In the Host inventory table, click the Some validations failed link for each host displaying this status.
2. Click Add NTP sources, and then add the IP address 169.254.169.254 for one of the nodes.
3. Wait for 2 - 3 minutes until all the Some validations failed indicators disappear.
4. Select Next.
