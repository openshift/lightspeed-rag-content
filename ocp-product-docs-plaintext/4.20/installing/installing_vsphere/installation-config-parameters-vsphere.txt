# Installation configuration parameters for vSphere


Before you deploy an {product-title} cluster on vSphere, you can configure parameters to customize your cluster and the platform that hosts it. The installation program uses the information in the install-config.yaml file to provision required infrastructure and deploy cluster components. When you create the install-config.yaml file, you can configure the values for your required parameters through the command line. Edit the install-config.yaml file to customize your cluster further before installation begins.

# Available installation configuration parameters for vSphere

The following tables specify the required, optional, and vSphere-specific installation configuration parameters that you can set as part of the installation process.


[IMPORTANT]
----
After installation, you cannot change these parameters in the install-config.yaml file.
----

## Required configuration parameters

Required installation configuration parameters are described in the following table:



## Network configuration parameters

You can customize your installation configuration based on the requirements of your existing network infrastructure. For example, you can expand the IP address block for the cluster network or configure different IP address blocks than the defaults.

Consider the following information before you configure network parameters for your cluster:

* If you use the Red Hat OpenShift Networking OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, both IPv4 and IPv6 address families are supported.
* If you deployed nodes in an {product-title} cluster with a network that supports both IPv4 and non-link-local IPv6 addresses, configure your cluster to use a dual-stack network.
* For clusters configured for dual-stack networking, both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic must use the same network interface as the default gateway. This ensures that in a multiple network interface controller (NIC) environment, a cluster can detect what NIC to use based on the available network interface. For more information, see "OVN-Kubernetes IPv6 and dual-stack limitations" in About the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin.
* To prevent network connectivity issues, do not install a single-stack IPv4 cluster on a host that supports dual-stack networking.


[NOTE]
----
On VMware vSphere, dual-stack networking can specify either IPv4 or IPv6 as the primary address family.
----

If you configure your cluster to use both IP address families, review the following requirements:

* Both IP families must use the same network interface for the default gateway.
* Both IP families must have the default gateway.
* You must specify IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in the same order for all network configuration parameters. For example, in the following configuration, IPv4 addresses are listed before IPv6 addresses:

```yaml
networking:
  clusterNetwork:
  - cidr: 10.128.0.0/14
    hostPrefix: 23
  - cidr: fd00:10:128::/56
    hostPrefix: 64
  serviceNetwork:
  - 172.30.0.0/16
  - fd00:172:16::/112
```




## Optional configuration parameters

Optional installation configuration parameters are described in the following table:



## Additional VMware vSphere configuration parameters

Additional VMware vSphere configuration parameters are described in the following table:



## Deprecated VMware vSphere configuration parameters

In {product-title} 4.13, the following vSphere configuration parameters are deprecated. You can continue to use these parameters, but the installation program does not automatically specify these parameters in the install-config.yaml file.

The following table lists each deprecated vSphere configuration parameter:



## Optional VMware vSphere machine pool configuration parameters

Optional VMware vSphere machine pool configuration parameters are described in the following table:
