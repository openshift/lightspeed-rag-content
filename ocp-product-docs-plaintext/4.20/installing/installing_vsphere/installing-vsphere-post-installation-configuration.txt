# Configuring the vSphere connection settings after an installation

After installing an {product-title} cluster on vSphere with the platform integration feature enabled, you might need to update the vSphere connection settings manually, depending on the installation method.
For installations using the Assisted Installer, you must update the connection settings. This is because the Assisted Installer adds default connection settings to the vSphere connection configuration wizard as placeholders during the installation.
For installer-provisioned or user-provisioned infrastructure installations, you should have entered valid connection settings during the installation. You can use the vSphere connection configuration wizard at any time to validate or modify the connection settings, but this is not mandatory for completing the installation.

# Configuring the vSphere connection settings

Modify the following vSphere configuration settings as required:

* vCenter address
* vCenter cluster
* vCenter username
* vCenter password
* vCenter address
* vSphere data center
* vSphere datastore
* Virtual machine folder

* The Assisted Installer has finished installing the cluster successfully.
* The cluster is connected to https://console.redhat.com.

1. In the Administrator perspective, navigate to Home -> Overview.
2. Under Status, click vSphere connection to open the vSphere connection configuration wizard.
3. In the vCenter field, enter the network address of the vSphere vCenter server. This can be either a domain name or an IP address. It appears in the vSphere web client URL; for example https://[your_vCenter_address]/ui.
4. In the vCenter cluster field, enter the name of the vSphere vCenter cluster where {product-title} is installed.

[IMPORTANT]
----
This step is mandatory if you installed {product-title} 4.13 or later.
----
5. In the Username field, enter your vSphere vCenter username.
6. In the Password field, enter your vSphere vCenter password.

[WARNING]
----
The system stores the username and password in the vsphere-creds secret in the kube-system namespace of the cluster. An incorrect vCenter username or password makes the cluster nodes unschedulable.
----
7. In the Datacenter field, enter the name of the vSphere data center that contains the virtual machines used to host the cluster; for example, SDDC-Datacenter.
8. In the Default data store field, enter the path and name of the vSphere data store that stores the persistent data volumes; for example, /SDDC-Datacenter/datastore/datastorename.

[WARNING]
----
Updating the vSphere data center or default data store after the configuration has been saved detaches any active vSphere PersistentVolumes.
----
9. In the Virtual Machine Folder field, enter the data center folder that contains the virtual machine of the cluster; for example, /SDDC-Datacenter/vm/ci-ln-hjg4vg2-c61657-t2gzr. For the {product-title} installation to succeed, all virtual machines comprising the cluster must be located in a single data center folder.
10. Click Save Configuration. This updates the cloud-provider-config ConfigMap resource in the openshift-config namespace, and starts the configuration process.
11. Reopen the vSphere connection configuration wizard and expand the Monitored operators panel. Check that the status of the operators is either Progressing or Healthy.

# Verifying the configuration

The connection configuration process updates operator statuses and control plane nodes. It takes approximately an hour to complete. During the configuration process, the nodes will reboot. Previously bound PersistentVolumeClaims objects might become disconnected.

* You have saved the configuration settings in the vSphere connection configuration wizard.

1. Check that the configuration process completed successfully:
1. In the OpenShift Container Platform Administrator perspective, navigate to Home -> Overview.
2. Under Status click Operators. Wait for all operator statuses to change from  Progressing to All succeeded.  A Failed status indicates that the configuration failed.
3. Under Status, click Control Plane. Wait for the response rate of all Control Pane components to return to 100%. A Failed control plane component indicates that the configuration failed.

A failure indicates that at least one of the connection settings is incorrect. Change the settings in the vSphere connection configuration wizard and save the configuration again.
2. Check that you are able to bind PersistentVolumeClaims objects by performing the following steps:
1. Create a StorageClass object using the following YAML:

```yaml
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
 name: vsphere-sc
provisioner: kubernetes.io/vsphere-volume
parameters:
 datastore: YOURVCENTERDATASTORE
 diskformat: thin
reclaimPolicy: Delete
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
```

2. Create a PersistentVolumeClaims object using the following YAML:

```yaml
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
 name: test-pvc
 namespace: openshift-config
 annotations:
   volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-provisioner: kubernetes.io/vsphere-volume
 finalizers:
   - kubernetes.io/pvc-protection
spec:
 accessModes:
   - ReadWriteOnce
 resources:
   requests:
    storage: 10Gi
 storageClassName: vsphere-sc
 volumeMode: Filesystem
```


If you are unable to create a PersistentVolumeClaims object, you can troubleshoot by navigating to Storage &#8594; PersistentVolumeClaims in the Administrator perspective of the {product-title} web console.
