# Uninstalling a cluster on Azure


You can remove a cluster that you deployed to Microsoft Azure.

# Removing a cluster that uses installer-provisioned infrastructure

You can remove a cluster that uses installer-provisioned infrastructure that you provisioned from your cloud platform.


[NOTE]
----
After uninstallation, check your cloud provider for any resources that were not removed properly, especially with user-provisioned infrastructure clusters. Some resources might exist because either the installation program did not create the resource or could not access the resource.
----

* You have a copy of the installation program that you used to deploy the cluster.
* You have the files that the installation program generated when you created your
cluster.

1. From the directory that has the installation program on the computer that you used to install the cluster, run the following command:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install destroy cluster \
--dir <installation_directory> --log-level info 1 2
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the path to the directory that you
stored the installation files in.
To view different details, specify warn, debug, or error instead of info.

[NOTE]
----
You must specify the directory that includes the cluster definition files for your cluster. The installation program requires the metadata.json file in this directory to delete the cluster.
----
2. Optional: Delete the <installation_directory> directory and the {product-title} installation program.

# Deleting Microsoft Azure resources with the Cloud Credential Operator utility

After uninstalling an {product-title} cluster that uses short-term credentials managed outside the cluster, you can use the CCO utility (ccoctl) to remove the {cp-first} ({cp}) resources that ccoctl created during installation.

* Extract and prepare the ccoctl binary.
* Uninstall an {product-title} cluster on {cp} that uses short-term credentials.

* Delete the {cp} resources that ccoctl created by running the following command:

```terminal
$ ccoctl {cp-name} delete \
  --name=<name> \1
  --region=<{cp-name}_region> \2
  --subscription-id=<{cp-name}_subscription_id> \3
  --delete-oidc-resource-group
```

<name> matches the name that was originally used to create and tag the cloud resources.
<{cp-name}_region> is the {cp} region in which to delete cloud resources.
<{cp-name}_subscription_id> is the {cp} subscription ID for which to delete cloud resources.

* To verify that the resources are deleted, query {cp}. For more information, refer to {cp} documentation.
