# Installing a three-node cluster on Nutanix


In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a three-node cluster on Nutanix. A three-node cluster consists of three control plane machines, which also act as compute machines. This type of cluster provides a smaller, more resource efficient cluster, for cluster administrators and developers to use for testing, development, and production.

# Configuring a three-node cluster

To configure a three-node cluster, set the number of worker nodes to 0 in the install-config.yaml file before you deploy the cluster.

Setting the number of worker nodes to 0 ensures that the control plane machines are schedulable. This allows application workloads to be scheduled to run from the control plane nodes.


[NOTE]
----
Because application workloads run from control plane nodes, additional subscriptions are required, as the control plane nodes are considered to be compute nodes.
----

* You have an existing install-config.yaml file.

* Set the number of compute replicas to 0 in your install-config.yaml file, as shown in the following compute stanza:
Example install-config.yaml file for a three-node cluster

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
compute:
- name: worker
  platform: {}
  replicas: 0
# ...
```
