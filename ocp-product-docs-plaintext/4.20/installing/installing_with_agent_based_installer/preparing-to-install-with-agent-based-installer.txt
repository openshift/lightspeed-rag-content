# Preparing to install with the Agent-based Installer



# About the Agent-based Installer

The Agent-based installation method provides the flexibility to boot your on-premise servers in any way that you choose. It combines the ease of use of the Assisted Installation service with the ability to run offline, including in air-gapped environments.
Agent-based installation is a subcommand of the {product-title} installer.
It generates a bootable ISO image containing all of the information required to deploy an {product-title} cluster, with an available release image.

The configuration is in the same format as for the installer-provisioned infrastructure and user-provisioned infrastructure installation methods.
The Agent-based Installer can also optionally generate or accept Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) custom resources. ZTP allows you to provision new edge sites with declarative configurations of bare-metal equipment.



# Understanding Agent-based Installer

As an {product-title} user, you can leverage the advantages of the Assisted Installer hosted service in disconnected environments.

The Agent-based installation comprises a bootable ISO that contains the Assisted discovery agent and the Assisted Service. Both are required to perform the cluster installation, but the latter runs on only one of the hosts.


[NOTE]
----
Currently, ISO boot support on IBM Z(R) (s390x) is available only for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) KVM, which provides the flexibility to choose either PXE or ISO-based installation. For installations with z/VM and Logical Partition (LPAR), only PXE boot is supported.
----

The openshift-install agent create image subcommand generates an ephemeral ISO based on the inputs that you provide. You can choose to provide inputs through the following manifests:

Preferred:

* install-config.yaml
* agent-config.yaml

Optional: ZTP manifests

* cluster-manifests/cluster-deployment.yaml
* cluster-manifests/agent-cluster-install.yaml
* cluster-manifests/pull-secret.yaml
* cluster-manifests/infraenv.yaml
* cluster-manifests/cluster-image-set.yaml
* cluster-manifests/nmstateconfig.yaml
* mirror/registries.conf
* mirror/ca-bundle.crt

## Agent-based Installer workflow

One of the control plane hosts runs the Assisted Service at the start of the boot process and eventually becomes the bootstrap host. This node is called the rendezvous host (node 0).
The Assisted Service ensures that all the hosts meet the requirements and triggers an {product-title} cluster deployment. All the nodes have the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) image written to the disk. The non-bootstrap nodes reboot and initiate a cluster deployment.
Once the nodes are rebooted, the rendezvous host reboots and joins the cluster. The bootstrapping is complete and the cluster is deployed.

![Agent-based installer workflow]

You can install a disconnected {product-title} cluster through the openshift-install agent create image subcommand for the following topologies:

* A single-node {product-title} cluster (SNO): A node that is both a master and worker.
* A three-node {product-title} cluster : A compact cluster that has three master nodes that are also worker nodes.
* Highly available {product-title} cluster (HA): Three master nodes with any number of worker nodes.

## Recommended resources for topologies

Recommended cluster resources for the following topologies:



In the install-config.yaml, specify the platform on which to perform the installation. The following platforms are supported:

* baremetal
* vsphere
* nutanix
* external
* none

[IMPORTANT]
----
For platform none:
* The none option requires the provision of DNS name resolution and load balancing infrastructure in your cluster. See Requirements for a cluster using the platform "none" option in the "Additional resources" section for more information.
* Review the information in the guidelines for deploying {product-title} on non-tested platforms before you attempt to install an {product-title} cluster in virtualized or cloud environments.
----

[NOTE]
----
For installations on IBM Z(R) (s390x) architecture, the minimum memory requirement is 24 GB RAM per host instead of 16 GB.
----

* Requirements for a cluster using the platform "none" option
* Increase the network MTU
* Adding worker nodes to single-node OpenShift clusters

# About FIPS compliance

For many {product-title} customers, regulatory readiness, or compliance, on some level is required before any systems can be put into production. That regulatory readiness can be imposed by national standards, industry standards or the organization&#8217;s corporate governance framework.
Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) compliance is one of the most critical components required in highly secure environments to ensure that only supported cryptographic technologies are allowed on nodes.


[IMPORTANT]
----
To enable FIPS mode for your cluster, you must run the installation program from a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) computer configured to operate in FIPS mode. For more information about configuring FIPS mode on RHEL, see Switching RHEL to FIPS mode.
When running Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) booted in FIPS mode, {product-title} core components use the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures.
----

# Configuring FIPS through the Agent-based Installer

During a cluster deployment, the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) change is applied when the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines are deployed in your cluster. For Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) machines, you must enable FIPS mode when you install the operating system on the machines that you plan to use as worker machines.


[IMPORTANT]
----
{product-title} requires the use of a FIPS-capable installation binary to install a cluster in FIPS mode.
----

You can enable FIPS mode through the preferred method of install-config.yaml and agent-config.yaml:

1. You must set value of the fips field to true in the install-config.yaml file:
Sample install-config.yaml.file

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: test.example.com
metadata:
  name: sno-cluster
fips: true
```


[IMPORTANT]
----
To enable FIPS mode on IBM Z(R) clusters, you must also enable FIPS in either the .parm file or using virt-install as outlined in the procedures for manually adding IBM Z(R) agents.
----
2. Optional: If you are using the GitOps ZTP manifests, you must set the value of fips as true in the agent-install.openshift.io/install-config-overrides field in the agent-cluster-install.yaml file:
Sample agent-cluster-install.yaml file

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions.hive.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: AgentClusterInstall
metadata:
  annotations:
    agent-install.openshift.io/install-config-overrides: '{"fips": true}'
  name: sno-cluster
  namespace: sno-cluster-test
```


* OpenShift Security Guide Book
* Support for FIPS cryptography

# Host configuration

You can make additional configurations for each host on the cluster in the agent-config.yaml file, such as network configurations and root device hints.


[IMPORTANT]
----
For each host you configure, you must provide the MAC address of an interface on the host to specify which host you are configuring.
----

## Host roles

Each host in the cluster is assigned a role of either master or worker.
You can define the role for each host in the agent-config.yaml file by using the role parameter.
If you do not assign a role to the hosts, the roles will be assigned at random during installation.

It is recommended to explicitly define roles for your hosts.

The rendezvousIP must be assigned to a host with the master role. This can be done manually or by allowing the Agent-based Installer to assign the role.


[IMPORTANT]
----
You do not need to explicitly define the master role for the rendezvous host, however you cannot create configurations that conflict with this assignment.
For example, if you have 4 hosts with 3 of the hosts explicitly defined to have the master role, the last host that is automatically assigned the worker role during installation cannot be configured as the rendezvous host.
----


```yaml
apiVersion: v1beta1
kind: AgentConfig
metadata:
  name: example-cluster
rendezvousIP: 192.168.111.80
hosts:
  - hostname: master-1
    role: master
    interfaces:
      - name: eno1
        macAddress: 00:ef:44:21:e6:a5
  - hostname: master-2
    role: master
    interfaces:
      - name: eno1
        macAddress: 00:ef:44:21:e6:a6
  - hostname: master-3
    role: master
    interfaces:
      - name: eno1
        macAddress: 00:ef:44:21:e6:a7
  - hostname: worker-1
    role: worker
    interfaces:
      - name: eno1
        macAddress: 00:ef:44:21:e6:a8
```


## About root device hints

The rootDeviceHints parameter enables the installer to provision the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) image to a particular device. The installer examines the devices in the order it discovers them, and compares the discovered values with the hint values. The installer uses the first discovered device that matches the hint value. The configuration can combine multiple hints, but a device must match all hints for the installer to select it.




```yaml
     - name: master-0
       role: master
       rootDeviceHints:
         deviceName: "/dev/sda"
```


# About networking

The rendezvous IP must be known at the time of generating the agent ISO, so that during the initial boot all the hosts can check in to the assisted service.
If the IP addresses are assigned using a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server, then the rendezvousIP field must be set to an IP address of one of the hosts that will become part of the deployed control plane.
In an environment without a DHCP server, you can define IP addresses statically.

In addition to static IP addresses, you can apply any network configuration that is in NMState format. This includes VLANs and NIC bonds.

## DHCP

You must specify the value for the rendezvousIP field. The networkConfig fields can be left blank:


```yaml
apiVersion: v1alpha1
kind: AgentConfig
metadata:
  name: sno-cluster
rendezvousIP: 192.168.111.80 1
```


The IP address for the rendezvous host.

## Static networking

1. Preferred method: install-config.yaml and agent-config.yaml
Sample agent-config.yaml.file

```yaml
cat > agent-config.yaml << EOF
apiVersion: v1alpha1
kind: AgentConfig
metadata:
  name: sno-cluster
rendezvousIP: 192.168.111.80 1
hosts:
  - hostname: master-0
    interfaces:
      - name: eno1
        macAddress: 00:ef:44:21:e6:a5 2
    networkConfig:
      interfaces:
        - name: eno1
          type: ethernet
          state: up
          mac-address: 00:ef:44:21:e6:a5
          ipv4:
            enabled: true
            address:
              - ip: 192.168.111.80 3
                prefix-length: 23 4
            dhcp: false
      dns-resolver:
        config:
          server:
            - 192.168.111.1 5
      routes:
        config:
          - destination: 0.0.0.0/0
            next-hop-address: 192.168.111.1 6
            next-hop-interface: eno1
            table-id: 254
EOF
```

If a value is not specified for the rendezvousIP field, one address will be chosen from the static IP addresses specified in the networkConfig fields.
The MAC address of an interface on the host, used to determine which host to apply the configuration to.
The static IP address of the target bare metal host.
The static IP address’s subnet prefix for the target bare metal host.
The DNS server for the target bare metal host.
Next hop address for the node traffic. This must be in the same subnet as the IP address set for the specified interface.
2. Optional method: GitOps ZTP manifests

The optional method of the GitOps ZTP custom resources comprises 6 custom resources; you can configure static IPs in the nmstateconfig.yaml file.

```yaml
apiVersion: agent-install.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: NMStateConfig
metadata:
  name: master-0
  namespace: openshift-machine-api
  labels:
    cluster0-nmstate-label-name: cluster0-nmstate-label-value
spec:

        ipv4:
          enabled: true
          address:
            - ip: 192.168.122.2 1
              prefix-length: 23 2
          dhcp: false
    dns-resolver:

    routes:
      config:
        - destination: 0.0.0.0/0
          next-hop-address: 192.168.122.1 4
          next-hop-interface: eth0
          table-id: 254
  interfaces:
    - name: eth0
      macAddress: 52:54:01:aa:aa:a1 5
```

The static IP address of the target bare metal host.
The static IP address’s subnet prefix for the target bare metal host.
The DNS server for the target bare metal host.
Next hop address for the node traffic. This must be in the same subnet as the IP address set for the specified interface.
The MAC address of an interface on the host, used to determine which host to apply the configuration to.

The rendezvous IP is chosen from the static IP addresses specified in the config fields.

# Requirements for a cluster using the platform "none" option

This section describes the requirements for an Agent-based {product-title} installation that is configured to use the platform none option.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Review the information in the guidelines for deploying {product-title} on non-tested platforms before you attempt to install an {product-title} cluster in virtualized or cloud environments.
----

## Platform "none" DNS requirements

In {product-title} deployments, DNS name resolution is required for the following components:

* The Kubernetes API
* The {product-title} application wildcard
* The control plane and compute machines

Reverse DNS resolution is also required for the Kubernetes API, the control plane machines, and the compute machines.

DNS A/AAAA or CNAME records are used for name resolution and PTR records are used for reverse name resolution. The reverse records are important because Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) uses the reverse records to set the hostnames for all the nodes, unless the hostnames are provided by DHCP. Additionally, the reverse records are used to generate the certificate signing requests (CSR) that {product-title} needs to operate.


[NOTE]
----
It is recommended to use a DHCP server to provide the hostnames to each cluster node.
----

The following DNS records are required for an {product-title} cluster using the platform none option and they must be in place before installation. In each record, <cluster_name> is the cluster name and <base_domain> is the base domain that you specify in the install-config.yaml file. A complete DNS record takes the form: <component>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>..




[NOTE]
----
In {product-title} 4.4 and later, you do not need to specify etcd host and SRV records in your DNS configuration.
----


[TIP]
----
You can use the dig command to verify name and reverse name resolution.
----

### Example DNS configuration for platform "none" clusters

This section provides A and PTR record configuration samples that meet the DNS requirements for deploying {product-title} using the platform none option. The samples are not meant to provide advice for choosing one DNS solution over another.

In the examples, the cluster name is ocp4 and the base domain is example.com.

The following example is a BIND zone file that shows sample A records for name resolution in a cluster using the platform none option.

Provides name resolution for the wildcard routes. The record refers to the IP address of the application ingress load balancer. The application ingress load balancer targets the machines that run the Ingress Controller pods. The Ingress Controller pods run on the compute machines by default.

[NOTE]
----
In the example, the same load balancer is used for the Kubernetes API and application ingress traffic. In production scenarios, you can deploy the API and application ingress load balancers separately so that you can scale the load balancer infrastructure for each in isolation.

A PTR record is not required for the {product-title} application wildcard.
----

## Platform "none" Load balancing requirements

Before you install {product-title}, you must provision the API and application Ingress load balancing infrastructure. In production scenarios, you can deploy the API and application Ingress load balancers separately so that you can scale the load balancer infrastructure for each in isolation.


[NOTE]
----
These requirements do not apply to single-node OpenShift clusters using the platform none option.
----


[NOTE]
----
If you want to deploy the API and application Ingress load balancers with a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) instance, you must purchase the RHEL subscription separately.
----

The load balancing infrastructure must meet the following requirements:

1. API load balancer: Provides a common endpoint for users, both human and machine, to interact with and configure the platform. Configure the following conditions:
* Layer 4 load balancing only. This can be referred to as Raw TCP, SSL Passthrough, or SSL Bridge mode. If you use SSL Bridge mode, you must enable Server Name Indication (SNI) for the API routes.
* A stateless load balancing algorithm. The options vary based on the load balancer implementation.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not configure session persistence for an API load balancer.
----

Configure the following ports on both the front and back of the load balancers:
API load balancer


[NOTE]
----
The load balancer must be configured to take a maximum of 30 seconds from the
time the API server turns off the /readyz endpoint to the removal of the API
server instance from the pool. Within the time frame after /readyz returns an
error or becomes healthy, the endpoint must have been removed or added. Probing
every 5 or 10 seconds, with two successful requests to become healthy and three
to become unhealthy, are well-tested values.
----
2. Application Ingress load balancer: Provides an ingress point for application traffic flowing in from outside the cluster. A working configuration for the Ingress router is required for an {product-title} cluster.

Configure the following conditions:
* Layer 4 load balancing only. This can be referred to as Raw TCP, SSL Passthrough, or SSL Bridge mode. If you use SSL Bridge mode, you must enable Server Name Indication (SNI) for the ingress routes.
* A connection-based or session-based persistence is recommended, based on the options available and types of applications that will be hosted on the platform.

[TIP]
----
If the true IP address of the client can be seen by the application Ingress load balancer, enabling source IP-based session persistence can improve performance for applications that use end-to-end TLS encryption.
----

Configure the following ports on both the front and back of the load balancers:
Application Ingress load balancer


[NOTE]
----
If you are deploying a three-node cluster with zero compute nodes, the Ingress Controller pods run on the control plane nodes. In three-node cluster deployments, you must configure your application Ingress load balancer to route HTTP and HTTPS traffic to the control plane nodes.
----

### Example load balancer configuration for platform "none" clusters

This section provides an example API and application Ingress load balancer configuration that meets the load balancing requirements for clusters using the platform none option. The sample is an /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg configuration for an HAProxy load balancer. The example is not meant to provide advice for choosing one load balancing solution over another.

In the example, the same load balancer is used for the Kubernetes API and application ingress traffic. In production scenarios, you can deploy the API and application ingress load balancers separately so that you can scale the load balancer infrastructure for each in isolation.


[NOTE]
----
If you are using HAProxy as a load balancer and SELinux is set to enforcing, you must ensure that the HAProxy service can bind to the configured TCP port by running setsebool -P haproxy_connect_any=1.

Port 6443 handles the Kubernetes API traffic and points to the control plane machines.
Port 22623 handles the machine config server traffic and points to the control plane machines.
Port 443 handles the HTTPS traffic and points to the machines that run the Ingress Controller pods. The Ingress Controller pods run on the compute machines by default.
Port 80 handles the HTTP traffic and points to the machines that run the Ingress Controller pods. The Ingress Controller pods run on the compute machines by default.

[NOTE]
----
If you are deploying a three-node cluster with zero compute nodes, the Ingress Controller pods run on the control plane nodes. In three-node cluster deployments, you must configure your application Ingress load balancer to route HTTP and HTTPS traffic to the control plane nodes.
----


[TIP]
----
If you are using HAProxy as a load balancer, you can check that the haproxy process is listening on ports 6443, 22623, 443, and 80 by running netstat -nltupe on the HAProxy node.

The networkConfig field includes information about the network configuration of the host, with subfields including interfaces,dns-resolver, and routes.
The interfaces field is an array of network interfaces defined for the host.
The name of the interface.
The type of interface. This example creates an ethernet interface.
Set this to false to disable DHCP for the physical function (PF) if it is not strictly required.
Set this to the number of SR-IOV virtual functions (VFs) to instantiate.
Set this to up.
Set this to false to disable IPv4 addressing for the VF attached to the bond.
Sets a minimum transmission rate, in Mbps, for the VF. This sample value sets a rate of 100 Mbps.
* This value must be less than or equal to the maximum transmission rate.
* Intel NICs do not support the min-tx-rate parameter. For more information, see BZ#1772847.
Sets a maximum transmission rate, in Mbps, for the VF. This sample value sets a rate of 200 Mbps.
Sets the needed bond mode.
Sets the preferred port of the bonding interface. The primary device is the first of the bonding interfaces to be used and is not abandoned unless it fails. This setting is particularly useful when one NIC in the bonding interface is faster and, therefore, able to handle a bigger load. This setting is only valid when the bonding interface is in active-backup mode (mode 1).
Sets a static IP address for the bond interface. This is the node IP address.
Sets bond0 as the gateway for the default route.

* Configuring network bonding

# Sample install-config.yaml file for bare metal

You can customize the install-config.yaml file to specify more details about your {product-title} cluster&#8217;s platform or modify the values of the required parameters.


```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com 1
compute: 2
- name: worker
  replicas: 0 3
  architecture: amd64
controlPlane: 2
  name: master
  replicas: 1 4
  architecture: amd64
metadata:
  name: sno-cluster 5
networking:
  clusterNetwork:
  - cidr: 10.128.0.0/14 6
    hostPrefix: 23 7
  networkType: OVNKubernetes 8
  serviceNetwork: 9
  - 172.30.0.0/16
platform:
  none: {} 10
fips: false 11
pullSecret: '{"auths": ...}' 12
sshKey: 'ssh-ed25519 AAAA...' 13
```


The base domain of the cluster. All DNS records must be sub-domains of this base and include the cluster name.
The controlPlane section is a single mapping, but the compute section is a sequence of mappings. To meet the requirements of the different data structures, the first line of the compute section must begin with a hyphen, -, and the first line of the controlPlane section must not. Only one control plane pool is used.
This parameter controls the number of compute machines that the Agent-based installation waits to discover before triggering the installation process. It is the number of compute machines that must be booted with the generated ISO.

[NOTE]
----
If you are installing a three-node cluster, do not deploy any compute machines when you install the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines.
----
The number of control plane machines that you add to the cluster. Because the cluster uses these values as the number of etcd endpoints in the cluster, the value must match the number of control plane machines that you deploy.
The cluster name that you specified in your DNS records.
A block of IP addresses from which pod IP addresses are allocated. This block must not overlap with existing physical networks. These IP addresses are used for the pod network. If you need to access the pods from an external network, you must configure load balancers and routers to manage the traffic.

[NOTE]
----
Class E CIDR range is reserved for a future use. To use the Class E CIDR range, you must ensure your networking environment accepts the IP addresses within the Class E CIDR range.
----
The subnet prefix length to assign to each individual node. For example, if hostPrefix is set to 23, then each node is assigned a /23 subnet out of the given cidr, which allows for 510 (2^(32 - 23) - 2) pod IP addresses. If you are required to provide access to nodes from an external network, configure load balancers and routers to manage the traffic.
The cluster network plugin to install. The default value OVNKubernetes is the only supported value.
The IP address pool to use for service IP addresses. You can enter only one IP address pool. This block must not overlap with existing physical networks. If you need to access the services from an external network, configure load balancers and routers to manage the traffic.
You must set the platform to none for a single-node cluster. You can set the platform to vsphere, baremetal, or none for multi-node clusters.

[NOTE]
----
If you set the platform to vsphere or baremetal, you can configure IP address endpoints for cluster nodes in three ways:
* IPv4
* IPv6
* IPv4 and IPv6 in parallel (dual-stack)

```yaml
networking:
  clusterNetwork:
    - cidr: 172.21.0.0/16
      hostPrefix: 23
    - cidr: fd02::/48
      hostPrefix: 64
  machineNetwork:
    - cidr: 192.168.11.0/16
    - cidr: 2001:DB8::/32
  serviceNetwork:
    - 172.22.0.0/16
    - fd03::/112
  networkType: OVNKubernetes
platform:
  baremetal:
    apiVIPs:
    - 192.168.11.3
    - 2001:DB8::4
    ingressVIPs:
    - 192.168.11.4
    - 2001:DB8::5
```

----
Whether to enable or disable FIPS mode. By default, FIPS mode is not enabled. If FIPS mode is enabled, the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines that {product-title} runs on bypass the default Kubernetes cryptography suite and use the cryptography modules that are provided with RHCOS instead.

[IMPORTANT]
----
When running Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) booted in FIPS mode, {product-title} core components use the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures.
----
This pull secret allows you to authenticate with the services that are provided by the included authorities, including Quay.io, which serves the container images for {product-title} components.
The SSH public key for the core user in Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS).

[NOTE]
----
For production {product-title} clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your ssh-agent process uses.

# Validation checks before agent ISO creation

The Agent-based Installer performs validation checks on user defined YAML files before the ISO is created. Once the validations are successful, the agent ISO
is created.

* baremetal, vsphere and none platforms are supported.
* The networkType parameter must be OVNKubernetes in the case of none platform.
* apiVIPs and ingressVIPs parameters must be set for bare metal and vSphere platforms.
* Some host-specific fields in the bare metal platform configuration that have equivalents in agent-config.yaml file are ignored. A warning message is logged if these fields are set.

* Each interface must have a defined MAC address. Additionally, all interfaces must have a different MAC address.
* At least one interface must be defined for each host.
* World Wide Name (WWN) vendor extensions are not supported in root device hints.
* The role parameter in the host object must have a value of either master or worker.

## ZTP manifests

* For IPv6, the only supported value for the networkType parameter is OVNKubernetes. The OpenshiftSDN value can be used only for IPv4.

* The ReleaseImage parameter must match the release defined in the installer.
