# Uninstalling a cluster on OpenStack


You can remove a cluster that you deployed to Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP).

# Removing a cluster that uses installer-provisioned infrastructure

You can remove a cluster that uses installer-provisioned infrastructure that you provisioned from your cloud platform.


[NOTE]
----
After uninstallation, check your cloud provider for any resources that were not removed properly, especially with user-provisioned infrastructure clusters. Some resources might exist because either the installation program did not create the resource or could not access the resource.
----

* You have a copy of the installation program that you used to deploy the cluster.
* You have the files that the installation program generated when you created your
cluster.
* You installed the core-installer tool by entering the sudo dnf install coreos-installer command in your CLI.

1. From the directory that has the installation program on the computer that you used to install the cluster, run the following command:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install destroy cluster \
--dir <installation_directory> --log-level info 1 2
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the path to the directory that you
stored the installation files in.
To view different details, specify warn, debug, or error instead of info.

[NOTE]
----
You must specify the directory that includes the cluster definition files for your cluster. The installation program requires the metadata.json file in this directory to delete the cluster.
----
2. Optional: Use the coreos-installer tool to add the coreos.inst.wipe=yes flag to the Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) boot configuration. This operation wipes the disk on your system so that if you create a new cluster, you have a clean installation environment. For more detailed instructions, see How to wipe OpenStack disks in {product-title} 4 reinstallation (Knowledgebase article).
3. Optional: Delete the <installation_directory> directory and the {product-title} installation program.
