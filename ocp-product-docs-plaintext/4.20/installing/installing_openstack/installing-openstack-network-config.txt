# Configuring network settings after installing OpenStack


You can configure network settings for an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) cluster after installation.

# Configuring application access with floating IP addresses

After you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, configure Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) to allow application network traffic.


[NOTE]
----
You do not need to perform this procedure if you provided values for platform.openstack.apiFloatingIP and platform.openstack.ingressFloatingIP in the install-config.yaml file, or os_api_fip and os_ingress_fip in the inventory.yaml playbook, during installation. The floating IP addresses are already set.
----

* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster must be installed
* Floating IP addresses are enabled as described in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on RHOSP installation documentation.

After you install the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, attach a floating IP address to the ingress port:

1. Show the port:

```terminal
$ openstack port show <cluster_name>-<cluster_ID>-ingress-port
```

2. Attach the port to the IP address:

```terminal
$ openstack floating ip set --port <ingress_port_ID> <apps_FIP>
```

3. Add a wildcard A record for *apps. to your DNS file:

```dns
*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>  IN  A  <apps_FIP>
```



[NOTE]
----
If you do not control the DNS server but want to enable application access for non-production purposes, you can add these hostnames to /etc/hosts:

```dns
<apps_FIP> console-openshift-console.apps.<cluster name>.<base domain>
<apps_FIP> integrated-oauth-server-openshift-authentication.apps.<cluster name>.<base domain>
<apps_FIP> oauth-openshift.apps.<cluster name>.<base domain>
<apps_FIP> prometheus-k8s-openshift-monitoring.apps.<cluster name>.<base domain>
<apps_FIP> <app name>.apps.<cluster name>.<base domain>
```

# Enabling OVS hardware offloading

For clusters that run on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP), you can enable Open vSwitch (OVS) hardware offloading.

OVS is a multi-layer virtual switch that enables large-scale, multi-server network virtualization.

* You installed a cluster on RHOSP that is configured for single-root input/output virtualization (SR-IOV).
* You installed the SR-IOV Network Operator on your cluster.
* You created two hw-offload type virtual function (VF) interfaces on your cluster.


[NOTE]
----
Application layer gateway flows are broken in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.10, 4.11, and 4.12. Also, you cannot offload the application layer gateway flow for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.13.
----

1. Create an SriovNetworkNodePolicy policy for the two hw-offload type VF interfaces that are on your cluster:
The first virtual function interface

```yaml
apiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1
kind: SriovNetworkNodePolicy 1
metadata:
  name: "hwoffload9"
  namespace: openshift-sriov-network-operator
spec:
  deviceType: netdevice
  isRdma: true
  nicSelector:
    pfNames: 2
    - ens6
  nodeSelector:
    feature.node.kubernetes.io/network-sriov.capable: 'true'
  numVfs: 1
  priority: 99
  resourceName: "hwoffload9"
```

Insert the SriovNetworkNodePolicy value here.
Both interfaces must include physical function (PF) names.
The second virtual function interface

```yaml
apiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1
kind: SriovNetworkNodePolicy 1
metadata:
  name: "hwoffload10"
  namespace: openshift-sriov-network-operator
spec:
  deviceType: netdevice
  isRdma: true
  nicSelector:
    pfNames: 2
    - ens5
  nodeSelector:
    feature.node.kubernetes.io/network-sriov.capable: 'true'
  numVfs: 1
  priority: 99
  resourceName: "hwoffload10"
```

Insert the SriovNetworkNodePolicy value here.
Both interfaces must include physical function (PF) names.
2. Create NetworkAttachmentDefinition resources for the two interfaces:
A NetworkAttachmentDefinition resource for the first interface

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/resourceName: openshift.io/hwoffload9
  name: hwoffload9
  namespace: default
spec:
    config: '{ "cniVersion":"0.3.1", "name":"hwoffload9","type":"host-device","device":"ens6"
    }'
```

A NetworkAttachmentDefinition resource for the second interface

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/resourceName: openshift.io/hwoffload10
  name: hwoffload10
  namespace: default
spec:
    config: '{ "cniVersion":"0.3.1", "name":"hwoffload10","type":"host-device","device":"ens5"
    }'
```

3. Use the interfaces that you created with a pod. For example:
A pod that uses the two OVS offload interfaces

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: dpdk-testpmd
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    irq-load-balancing.crio.io: disable
    cpu-quota.crio.io: disable
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/resourceName: openshift.io/hwoffload9
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/resourceName: openshift.io/hwoffload10
spec:
  restartPolicy: Never
  containers:
  - name: dpdk-testpmd
    image: quay.io/krister/centos8_nfv-container-dpdk-testpmd:latest
```


# Attaching an OVS hardware offloading network

You can attach an Open vSwitch (OVS) hardware offloading network to your cluster.

* Your cluster is installed and running.
* You provisioned an OVS hardware offloading network on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) to use with your cluster.

1. Create a file named network.yaml from the following template:

```yaml
spec:
  additionalNetworks:
  - name: hwoffload1
    namespace: cnf
    rawCNIConfig: '{ "cniVersion": "0.3.1", "name": "hwoffload1", "type": "host-device","pciBusId": "0000:00:05.0", "ipam": {}}' 1
    type: Raw
```


where:
pciBusId:: Specifies the device that is connected to the offloading network. If you do not have it, you can find this value by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc describe SriovNetworkNodeState -n openshift-sriov-network-operator
```

2. From a command line, enter the following command to patch your cluster with the file:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f network.yaml
```


# Enabling IPv6 connectivity to pods on RHOSP

To enable IPv6 connectivity between pods that have additional networks that are on different nodes, disable port security for the IPv6 port of the server. Disabling port security obviates the need to create allowed address pairs for each IPv6 address that is assigned to pods and enables traffic on the security group.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Only the following IPv6 additional network configurations are supported:
* SLAAC and host-device
* SLAAC and MACVLAN
* DHCP stateless and host-device
* DHCP stateless and MACVLAN
----

* On a command line, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ openstack port set --no-security-group --disable-port-security <compute_ipv6_port> 1
```

Specify the IPv6 port of the compute server.

[IMPORTANT]
----
This command removes security groups from the port and disables port security. Traffic restrictions are removed entirely from the port.
----

# Create pods that have IPv6 connectivity on RHOSP

After you enable IPv6 connectivty for pods and add it to them, create pods that have secondary IPv6 connections.

1. Define pods that use your IPv6 namespace and the annotation k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: <additional_network_name>, where <additional_network_name is the name of the additional network. For example, as part of a Deployment object:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: hello-openshift
  namespace: ipv6
spec:
  affinity:
    podAntiAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
         - labelSelector:
            matchExpressions:
            - key: app
              operator: In
              values:
              - hello-openshift
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hello-openshift
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hello-openshift
      annotations:
        k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: ipv6
    spec:
      securityContext:
        runAsNonRoot: true
        seccompProfile:
          type: RuntimeDefault
      containers:
      - name: hello-openshift
        securityContext:
          allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
          capabilities:
            drop:
            - ALL
        image: quay.io/openshift/origin-hello-openshift
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

2. Create the pod. For example, on a command line, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f <ipv6_enabled_resource> 1
```

Specify the file that contains your resource definition.

# Adding IPv6 connectivity to pods on RHOSP

After you enable IPv6 connectivity in pods, add connectivity to them by using a Container Network Interface (CNI) configuration.

1. To edit the Cluster Network Operator (CNO), enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc edit networks.operator.openshift.io cluster
```

2. Specify your CNI configuration under the spec field. For example, the following configuration uses a SLAAC address mode with MACVLAN:

```yaml
...
spec:
  additionalNetworks:
  - name: ipv6
    namespace: ipv6 1
    rawCNIConfig: '{ "cniVersion": "0.3.1", "name": "ipv6", "type": "macvlan", "master": "ens4"}' 2
    type: Raw
```

Be sure to create pods in the same namespace.
The interface in the network attachment "master" field can differ from "ens4" when more networks are configured or when a different kernel driver is used.

[NOTE]
----
If you are using stateful address mode, include the IP Address Management (IPAM) in the CNI configuration.
DHCPv6 is not supported by Multus.
----
3. Save your changes and quit the text editor to commit your changes.

* On a command line, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get network-attachment-definitions -A
```

Example output

```terminal
NAMESPACE       NAME            AGE
ipv6            ipv6            21h
```


You can now create pods that have secondary IPv6 connections.
