# Uninstalling a cluster on {rh-openstack} from your own infrastructure


You can remove a cluster that you deployed to Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) on user-provisioned infrastructure.

# Downloading playbook dependencies

The Ansible playbooks that simplify the removal process on user-provisioned
infrastructure require several Python modules. On the machine where you will run the process,
add the modules' repositories and then download them.


[NOTE]
----
These instructions assume that you are using Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.
----

* Python 3 is installed on your machine.

1. On a command line, add the repositories:
1. Register with Red Hat Subscription Manager:

```terminal
$ sudo subscription-manager register # If not done already
```

2. Pull the latest subscription data:

```terminal
$ sudo subscription-manager attach --pool=$YOUR_POOLID # If not done already
```

3. Disable the current repositories:

```terminal
$ sudo subscription-manager repos --disable=* # If not done already
```

4. Add the required repositories:

```terminal
$ sudo subscription-manager repos \
  --enable=rhel-9-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms \
  --enable=rhel-9-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms \
  --enable=openstack-17.1-for-rhel-9-x86_64-rpms
```

2. Install the modules:

```terminal
$ sudo yum install python3-openstackclient ansible python3-openstacksdk
```

3. Ensure that the python command points to python3:

```terminal
$ sudo alternatives --set python /usr/bin/python3
```


# Removing a cluster from RHOSP that uses your own infrastructure

You can remove an {product-title} cluster on Red&#160;Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) that uses your own infrastructure. To complete the removal process quickly, run several Ansible playbooks.

* Python 3 is installed on your machine.
* You downloaded the modules in "Downloading playbook dependencies."
* You have the playbooks that you used to install the cluster.
* You modified the playbooks that are prefixed with down- to reflect any changes that you made to their corresponding installation playbooks. For example, changes to the bootstrap.yaml file are reflected in the down-bootstrap.yaml file.
* All of the playbooks are in a common directory.

1. On a command line, run the playbooks that you downloaded:

```terminal
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml  \
	down-bootstrap.yaml      \
	down-control-plane.yaml  \
	down-compute-nodes.yaml  \
	down-load-balancers.yaml \
	down-network.yaml        \
	down-security-groups.yaml
```

2. Remove any DNS record changes you made for the {product-title} installation.

{product-title} is removed from your infrastructure.
