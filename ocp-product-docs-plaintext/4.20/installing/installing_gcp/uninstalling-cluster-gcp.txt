# Uninstalling a cluster on GCP


You can remove a cluster that you deployed to Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

# Removing a cluster that uses installer-provisioned infrastructure

You can remove a cluster that uses installer-provisioned infrastructure that you provisioned from your cloud platform.


[NOTE]
----
After uninstallation, check your cloud provider for any resources that were not removed properly, especially with user-provisioned infrastructure clusters. Some resources might exist because either the installation program did not create the resource or could not access the resource.
For example, some Google Cloud resources require IAM permissions in shared VPC host projects, or there might be unused health checks that must be deleted.
----

* You have a copy of the installation program that you used to deploy the cluster.
* You have the files that the installation program generated when you created your
cluster.

1. From the directory that has the installation program on the computer that you used to install the cluster, run the following command:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install destroy cluster \
--dir <installation_directory> --log-level info 1 2
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the path to the directory that you
stored the installation files in.
To view different details, specify warn, debug, or error instead of info.

[NOTE]
----
You must specify the directory that includes the cluster definition files for your cluster. The installation program requires the metadata.json file in this directory to delete the cluster.
----
2. Optional: Delete the <installation_directory> directory and the {product-title} installation program.

# Deleting Google Cloud Platform resources with the Cloud Credential Operator utility

After uninstalling an {product-title} cluster that uses short-term credentials managed outside the cluster, you can use the CCO utility (ccoctl) to remove the {cp-first} ({cp}) resources that ccoctl created during installation.

* Extract and prepare the ccoctl binary.
* Uninstall an {product-title} cluster on {cp} that uses short-term credentials.

1. Set a $RELEASE_IMAGE variable with the release image from your installation file by running the following command:

```terminal
$ RELEASE_IMAGE=$(./openshift-install version | awk '/release image/ {print $3}')
```

2. Extract the list of CredentialsRequest custom resources (CRs) from the {product-title} release image by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc adm release extract \
  --from=$RELEASE_IMAGE \
  --credentials-requests \
  --included \1
  --to=<path_to_directory_for_credentials_requests> 2
```

The --included parameter includes only the manifests that your specific cluster configuration requires.
Specify the path to the directory where you want to store the CredentialsRequest objects. If the specified directory does not exist, this command creates it.
3. Delete the {cp} resources that ccoctl created by running the following command:

```terminal
$ ccoctl {cp-name} delete \
  --name=<name> \1
  --project=<{cp-name}_project_id> \2
  --credentials-requests-dir=<path_to_credentials_requests_directory> \
  --force-delete-custom-roles 3
```

<name> matches the name that was originally used to create and tag the cloud resources.
<{cp-name}_project_id> is the {cp} project ID in which to delete cloud resources.
Optional: This parameter deletes the custom roles that the ccoctl utility creates during installation. GCP does not permanently delete custom roles immediately. For more information, see GCP documentation about deleting a custom role.

* To verify that the resources are deleted, query {cp}. For more information, refer to {cp} documentation.
