# Installing a three-node cluster on GCP


In {product-title} version {product-version}, you can install a three-node cluster on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). A three-node cluster consists of three control plane machines, which also act as compute machines. This type of cluster provides a smaller, more resource efficient cluster, for cluster administrators and developers to use for testing, development, and production.
You can install a three-node cluster using either installer-provisioned or user-provisioned infrastructure.

# Configuring a three-node cluster

You configure a three-node cluster by setting the number of worker nodes to 0 in the install-config.yaml file before deploying the cluster. Setting the number of worker nodes to 0 ensures that the control plane machines are schedulable. This allows application workloads to be scheduled to run from the control plane nodes.


[NOTE]
----
Because application workloads run from control plane nodes, additional subscriptions are required, as the control plane nodes are considered to be compute nodes.
----

* You have an existing install-config.yaml file.

1. Set the number of compute replicas to 0 in your install-config.yaml file, as shown in the following compute stanza:
Example install-config.yaml file for a three-node cluster

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
compute:
- name: worker
  platform: {}
  replicas: 0
# ...
```

2. If you are deploying a cluster with user-provisioned infrastructure:
* After you create the Kubernetes manifest files, make sure that the spec.mastersSchedulable parameter is set to true in cluster-scheduler-02-config.yml file. You can locate this file in <installation_directory>/manifests.
For more information, see "Creating the Kubernetes manifest and Ignition config files" in "Installing a cluster on user-provisioned infrastructure in GCP by using Deployment Manager templates".
* Do not create additional worker nodes.


```yaml
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Scheduler
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: cluster
spec:
  mastersSchedulable: true
  policy:
    name: ""
status: {}
```
