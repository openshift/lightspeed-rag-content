# Installation configuration parameters for GCP


Before you deploy an {product-title} cluster on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), you provide parameters to customize your cluster and the platform that hosts it. When you create the install-config.yaml file, you provide values for the required parameters through the command line. You can then modify the install-config.yaml file to customize your cluster further.
