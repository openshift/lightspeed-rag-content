2. Convert the image to QCOW2 format. For more information, see the following section.
3. Upload the image to the Object Storage Service bucket in Alibaba Cloud.
4. Import the image to the Elastic Compute Service in Alibaba Cloud.
5. Provision the Alibaba Cloud resources:
1. In the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) console, set the networking configurations.
2. In the Alibaba Cloud DNS console, define the Domain Name System.
3. In the Elastic Compute Service (ECS) console, provision the compute instances.
6. Complete host discovery in the Assisted Installer.
7. Complete the network configurations in Alibaba Cloud.

# Converting the discovery image to QCOW2 format

Convert the generated ISO to QCOW2 format before importing it into Alibaba Cloud.

* You have created a cluster and downloaded the discovery image in the Assisted Installer.
* You have access to a Linux machine that is outside the cluster, such as your desktop machine.

1. Open the command-line interface on the Linux machine.
2. Verify that the system has virtualization flags enabled by running the following command:

```terminal
$ grep -e lm -e svm -e vmx /proc/cpuinfo
```

3. Install the qemu-img package on a RHEL or Fedora machine by running the following command:

```terminal
$ sudo dnf install -y qemu-img
```


[NOTE]
----
If your system uses the APT package manager, install the package using the name qemu-utils instead.
----
4. Convert the image to QCOW2 by running the following command:

```terminal
$ qemu-img convert -O qcow2 ${CLUSTER_NAME}.iso ${CLUSTER_NAME}.qcow2
```
