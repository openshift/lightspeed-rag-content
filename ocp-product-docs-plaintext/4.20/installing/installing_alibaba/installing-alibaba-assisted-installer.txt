# Converting the discovery image to QCOW2 format

Convert the generated ISO to QCOW2 format before importing it into Alibaba Cloud.

* You have created a cluster and downloaded the discovery image in the Assisted Installer.
* You have access to a Linux machine that is outside the cluster, such as your desktop machine.

1. Open the command-line interface on the Linux machine.
2. Verify that the system has virtualization flags enabled by running the following command:

```terminal
$ grep -e lm -e svm -e vmx /proc/cpuinfo
```

3. Install the qemu-img package on a RHEL or Fedora machine by running the following command:

```terminal
$ sudo dnf install -y qemu-img
```


[NOTE]
----
If your system uses the APT package manager, install the package using the name qemu-utils instead.

4. Convert the image to QCOW2 by running the following command:

```terminal
$ qemu-img convert -O qcow2 ${CLUSTER_NAME}.iso ${CLUSTER_NAME}.qcow2
```
