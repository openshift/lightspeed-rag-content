# Configuring the OpenShift API for Data Protection with AWS S3 compatible storage


You install the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) with Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 compatible storage by installing the OADP Operator. The Operator installs Velero 1.16.

[NOTE]
----
Starting from OADP 1.0.4, all OADP 1.0.z versions can only be used as a dependency of the Migration Toolkit for Containers Operator and are not available as a standalone Operator.
----
You configure AWS for Velero, create a default Secret, and then install the Data Protection Application. For more details, see Installing the OADP Operator.
To install the OADP Operator in a restricted network environment, you must first disable the default OperatorHub sources and mirror the Operator catalog. See Using Operator Lifecycle Manager in disconnected environments for details.

# About Amazon Simple Storage Service, Identity and Access Management, and GovCloud

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is a storage solution of Amazon for the internet. As an authorized user, you can use this service to store and retrieve any amount of data whenever you want, from anywhere on the web.

You securely control access to Amazon S3 and other Amazon services by using the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) web service.

You can use IAM to manage permissions that control which AWS resources users can access. You use IAM to both authenticate, or verify that a user is who they claim to be, and to authorize, or grant permissions to use resources.

AWS GovCloud (US) is an Amazon storage solution developed to meet the stringent and specific data security requirements of the United States Federal Government. AWS GovCloud (US) works the same as Amazon S3 except for the following:

* You cannot copy the contents of an Amazon S3 bucket in the AWS GovCloud (US) regions directly to or from another AWS region.
* If you use Amazon S3 policies, use the AWS GovCloud (US) Amazon Resource Name (ARN) identifier to unambiguously specify a resource  across all of AWS, such as in IAM policies, Amazon S3 bucket names, and API calls.
* IIn AWS GovCloud (US) regions, ARNs have an identifier that is different from the one in other standard AWS regions, arn:aws-us-gov. If you need to specify the US-West or US-East region, use one the following ARNs:
* For US-West, use us-gov-west-1.
* For US-East, use us-gov-east-1.
* For all other standard regions, ARNs begin with: arn:aws.
* In AWS GovCloud (US) regions, use the endpoints listed in the AWS GovCloud (US-East) and AWS GovCloud (US-West) rows of the "Amazon S3 endpoints" table on Amazon Simple Storage Service endpoints and quotas. If you are processing export-controlled data, use one of the SSL/TLS endpoints. If you have FIPS requirements, use a FIPS 140-2 endpoint such as https://s3-fips.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com or https://s3-fips.us-gov-east-1.amazonaws.com.
* To find the other AWS-imposed restrictions, see How Amazon Simple Storage Service Differs for AWS GovCloud (US).

# Configuring Amazon Web Services

You configure Amazon Web Services (AWS) for the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP).

* You must have the AWS CLI installed.

1. Set the BUCKET variable:

```terminal
$ BUCKET=<your_bucket>
```

2. Set the REGION variable:

```terminal
$ REGION=<your_region>
```

3. Create an AWS S3 bucket:

```terminal
$ aws s3api create-bucket \
    --bucket $BUCKET \
    --region $REGION \
    --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=$REGION 1
```

us-east-1 does not support a LocationConstraint. If your region is us-east-1, omit --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=$REGION.
4. Create an IAM user:

```terminal
$ aws iam create-user --user-name velero 1
```

If you want to use Velero to back up multiple clusters with multiple S3 buckets, create a unique user name for each cluster.
5. Create a velero-policy.json file:

```terminal
$ cat > velero-policy.json <<EOF
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeVolumes",
                "ec2:DescribeSnapshots",
                "ec2:CreateTags",
                "ec2:CreateVolume",
                "ec2:CreateSnapshot",
                "ec2:DeleteSnapshot"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
                "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::${BUCKET}/*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetBucketLocation",
                "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::${BUCKET}"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
EOF
```

6. Attach the policies to give the velero user the minimum necessary permissions:

```terminal
$ aws iam put-user-policy \
  --user-name velero \
  --policy-name velero \
  --policy-document file://velero-policy.json
```

7. Create an access key for the velero user:

```terminal
$ aws iam create-access-key --user-name velero
```

Example output

```terminal
{
  "AccessKey": {
        "UserName": "velero",
        "Status": "Active",
        "CreateDate": "2017-07-31T22:24:41.576Z",
        "SecretAccessKey": <AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>,
        "AccessKeyId": <AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
  }
}
```

8. Create a credentials-velero file:

```terminal
$ cat << EOF > ./credentials-velero
[default]
aws_access_key_id=<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
aws_secret_access_key=<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
EOF
```


You use the credentials-velero file to create a Secret object for AWS before you install the Data Protection Application.

# About backup and snapshot locations and their secrets

You specify backup and snapshot locations and their secrets in the DataProtectionApplication custom resource (CR).

## Backup locations

You can specify one of the following AWS S3-compatible object storage solutions as a backup location:

* Multicloud Object Gateway (MCG)
* Red Hat Container Storage
* Ceph RADOS Gateway; also known as Ceph Object Gateway
* Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation
* MinIO

Velero backs up {product-title} resources, Kubernetes objects, and internal images as an archive file on object storage.

## Snapshot locations

If you use your cloud provider&#8217;s native snapshot API to back up persistent volumes, you must specify the cloud provider as the snapshot location.

If you use Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots, you do not need to specify a snapshot location because you will create a VolumeSnapshotClass CR to register the CSI driver.

If you use File System Backup (FSB), you do not need to specify a snapshot location because FSB backs up the file system on object storage.

## Secrets

If the backup and snapshot locations use the same credentials or if you do not require a snapshot location, you create a default Secret.

If the backup and snapshot locations use different credentials, you create two secret objects:

* Custom Secret for the backup location, which you specify in the DataProtectionApplication CR.
* Default Secret for the snapshot location, which is not referenced in the DataProtectionApplication CR.


[IMPORTANT]
----
The Data Protection Application requires a default Secret. Otherwise, the installation will fail.
If you do not want to specify backup or snapshot locations during the installation, you can create a default Secret with an empty credentials-velero file.
----

## Creating a default Secret

You create a default Secret if your backup and snapshot locations use the same credentials or if you do not require a snapshot location.

The default name of the Secret is cloud-credentials.


[NOTE]
----
The DataProtectionApplication custom resource (CR) requires a default Secret.  Otherwise, the installation will fail. If the name of the backup location Secret is not specified, the default name is used.
If you do not want to use the backup location credentials during the installation, you can create a Secret with the default name by using an empty credentials-velero file.
----

* Your object storage and cloud storage, if any, must use the same credentials.
* You must configure object storage for Velero.

1. Create a credentials-velero file for the backup storage location in the appropriate format for your cloud provider.

See the following example:

```terminal
[default]
aws_access_key_id=<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
aws_secret_access_key=<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
```

2. Create a Secret custom resource (CR) with the default name:

```terminal
$ oc create secret generic cloud-credentials -n openshift-adp --from-file cloud=credentials-velero
```


The Secret is referenced in the spec.backupLocations.credential block of the DataProtectionApplication CR when you install the Data Protection Application.

## Creating profiles for different credentials

If your backup and snapshot locations use different credentials, you create separate profiles in the credentials-velero file.

Then, you create a Secret object and specify the profiles in the DataProtectionApplication custom resource (CR).

1. Create a credentials-velero file with separate profiles for the backup and snapshot locations, as in the following example:

```terminal
[backupStorage]
aws_access_key_id=<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
aws_secret_access_key=<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>

[volumeSnapshot]
aws_access_key_id=<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
aws_secret_access_key=<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
```

2. Create a Secret object with the credentials-velero file:

```terminal
$ oc create secret generic cloud-credentials -n openshift-adp --from-file cloud=credentials-velero 1
```

3. Add the profiles to the DataProtectionApplication CR, as in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
metadata:
  name: <dpa_sample>
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
...
  backupLocations:
    - name: default
      velero:
        provider: aws
        default: true
        objectStorage:
          bucket: <bucket_name>
          prefix: <prefix>
        config:
          region: us-east-1
          profile: "backupStorage"
        credential:
          key: cloud
          name: cloud-credentials
  snapshotLocations:
    - velero:
        provider: aws
        config:
          region: us-west-2
          profile: "volumeSnapshot"
```


## Configuring the backup storage location using AWS

You can configure the AWS backup storage location (BSL) as shown in the following example procedure.

* You have created an object storage bucket using AWS.
* You have installed the OADP Operator.

* Configure the BSL custom resource (CR) with values as applicable to your use case.
Backup storage location

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: BackupStorageLocation
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  provider: aws 1
  objectStorage:
    bucket: <bucket_name> 2
    prefix: <bucket_prefix> 3
  credential: 4
    key: cloud 5
    name: cloud-credentials 6
  config:
    region: <bucket_region> 7
    s3ForcePathStyle: "true" 8
    s3Url: <s3_url> 9
    publicUrl: <public_s3_url> 10
    serverSideEncryption: AES256 11
    kmsKeyId: "50..c-4da1-419f-a16e-ei...49f" 12
    customerKeyEncryptionFile: "/credentials/customer-key" 13
    signatureVersion: "1" 14
    profile: "default" 15
    insecureSkipTLSVerify: "true" 16
    enableSharedConfig: "true" 17
    tagging: "" 18
    checksumAlgorithm: "CRC32" 19
```

The name of the object store plugin. In this example, the plugin is aws. This field is required.
The name of the bucket in which to store backups. This field is required.
The prefix within the bucket in which to store backups. This field is optional.
The credentials for the backup storage location. You can set custom credentials. If custom credentials are not set, the default credentials' secret is used.
The key within the secret credentials' data.
The name of the secret containing the credentials.
The AWS region where the bucket is located. Optional if s3ForcePathStyle is false.
A boolean flag to decide whether to use path-style addressing instead of virtual hosted bucket addressing. Set to true if using a storage service such as MinIO or NooBaa. This is an optional field. The default value is false.
You can specify the AWS S3 URL here for explicitness. This field is primarily for storage services such as MinIO or NooBaa. This is an optional field.
This field is primarily used for storage services such as MinIO or NooBaa. This is an optional field.
The name of the server-side encryption algorithm to use for uploading objects, for example, AES256. This is an optional field.
Specify an AWS KMS key ID. You can format, as shown in the example, as an alias, such as alias/<KMS-key-alias-name>, or the full ARN to enable encryption of the backups stored in S3. Note that kmsKeyId cannot be used in with customerKeyEncryptionFile. This is an optional field.
Specify the file that has the SSE-C customer key to enable customer key encryption of the backups stored in S3. The file must contain a 32-byte string. The customerKeyEncryptionFile field points to a mounted secret within the velero container. Add the following key-value pair to the velero cloud-credentials secret: customer-key: <your_b64_encoded_32byte_string>. Note that the customerKeyEncryptionFile field cannot be used with the kmsKeyId field. The default value is an empty string (""), which means SSE-C is disabled. This is an optional field.
The version of the signature algorithm used to create signed URLs. You use signed URLs to download the backups, or fetch the logs. Valid values are 1 and 4. The default version is 4. This is an optional field.
The name of the AWS profile in the credentials file. The default value is default. This is an optional field.
Set the insecureSkipTLSVerify field to true if you do not want to verify the TLS certificate when connecting to the object store, for example, for self-signed certificates with MinIO. Setting to true is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks and is not recommended for production workloads. The default value is false. This is an optional field.
Set the enableSharedConfig field to true if you want to load the credentials file as a shared config file. The default value is false. This is an optional field.
Specify the tags to annotate the AWS S3 objects. Specify the tags in key-value pairs. The default value is an empty string (""). This is an optional field.
Specify the checksum algorithm to use for uploading objects to S3. The supported values are: CRC32, CRC32C, SHA1, and SHA256. If you set the field as an empty string (""), the checksum check will be skipped. The default value is CRC32. This is an optional field.

## Creating an OADP SSE-C encryption key for additional data security

Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 applies server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) as the base level of encryption for every bucket in Amazon S3.

OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) encrypts data by using SSL/TLS, HTTPS, and the velero-repo-credentials secret when transferring the data from a cluster to storage. To protect backup data in case of lost or stolen AWS credentials, apply an additional layer of encryption.

The velero-plugin-for-aws plugin provides several additional encryption methods. You should review its configuration options and consider implementing additional encryption.

You can store your own encryption keys by using server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C). This feature provides additional security if your AWS credentials become exposed.


[WARNING]
----
Be sure to store cryptographic keys in a secure and safe manner. Encrypted data and backups cannot be recovered if you do not have the encryption key.
----

* To make OADP mount a secret that contains your SSE-C key to the Velero pod at /credentials, use the following default secret name for AWS: cloud-credentials, and leave at least one of the following labels empty:
* dpa.spec.backupLocations[].velero.credential
* dpa.spec.snapshotLocations[].velero.credential

This is a workaround for a known issue: https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-3971.


[NOTE]
----
The following procedure contains an example of a spec:backupLocations block that does not specify credentials. This example would trigger an OADP secret mounting.
----

* If you need the backup location to have credentials with a different name than cloud-credentials, you must add a snapshot location, such as the one in the following example, that does not contain a credential name. Because the example does not contain a credential name, the snapshot location will use cloud-credentials as its secret for taking snapshots.


```yaml
 snapshotLocations:
  - velero:
      config:
        profile: default
        region: <region>
      provider: aws
# ...
```


1. Create an SSE-C encryption key:
1. Generate a random number and save it as a file named sse.key by running the following command:

```terminal
$ dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1 count=32 > sse.key
```

2. Create an {product-title} secret:
* If you are initially installing and configuring OADP, create the AWS credential and encryption key secret at the same time by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create secret generic cloud-credentials --namespace openshift-adp --from-file cloud=<path>/openshift_aws_credentials,customer-key=<path>/sse.key
```

* If you are updating an existing installation, edit the values of the cloud-credential secret block of the DataProtectionApplication CR manifest, as in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  cloud: W2Rfa2V5X2lkPSJBS0lBVkJRWUIyRkQ0TlFHRFFPQiIKYXdzX3NlY3JldF9hY2Nlc3Nfa2V5P<snip>rUE1mNWVSbTN5K2FpeWhUTUQyQk1WZHBOIgo=
  customer-key: v+<snip>TFIiq6aaXPbj8dhos=
kind: Secret
# ...
```

3. Edit the value of the customerKeyEncryptionFile attribute in the backupLocations block of the DataProtectionApplication CR manifest, as in the following example:

```yaml
spec:
  backupLocations:
    - velero:
        config:
          customerKeyEncryptionFile: /credentials/customer-key
          profile: default
# ...
```


[WARNING]
----
You must restart the Velero pod to remount the secret credentials properly on an existing installation.
----

The installation is complete, and you can back up and restore {product-title} resources. The data saved in AWS S3 storage is encrypted with the new key, and you cannot download it from the AWS S3 console or API without the additional encryption key.

To verify that you cannot download the encrypted files without the inclusion of an additional key, create a test file, upload it, and then try to download it.

1. Create a test file by running the following command:

```terminal
$ echo "encrypt me please" > test.txt
```

2. Upload the test file by running the following command:

```terminal
$ aws s3api put-object \
  --bucket <bucket> \
  --key test.txt \
  --body test.txt \
  --sse-customer-key fileb://sse.key \
  --sse-customer-algorithm AES256
```

3. Try to download the file. In either the Amazon web console or the terminal, run the following command:

```terminal
$ s3cmd get s3://<bucket>/test.txt test.txt
```


The download fails because the file is encrypted with an additional key.
4. Download the file with the additional encryption key by running the following command:

```terminal
$ aws s3api get-object \
    --bucket <bucket> \
    --key test.txt \
    --sse-customer-key fileb://sse.key \
    --sse-customer-algorithm AES256 \
    downloaded.txt
```

5. Read the file contents by running the following command:

```terminal
$ cat downloaded.txt
```

Example output

```terminal
encrypt me please
```


You can also download the file with the additional encryption key backed up with Velero by running a different command. See Downloading a file with an SSE-C encryption key for files backed up by Velero.

### Downloading a file with an SSE-C encryption key for files backed up by Velero

When you are verifying an SSE-C encryption key, you can also download the file with the additional encryption key for files that were backed up with Velero.

* Download the file with the additional encryption key for files backed up by Velero by running the following command:

```terminal
$ aws s3api get-object \
  --bucket <bucket> \
  --key velero/backups/mysql-persistent-customerkeyencryptionfile4/mysql-persistent-customerkeyencryptionfile4.tar.gz \
  --sse-customer-key fileb://sse.key \
  --sse-customer-algorithm AES256 \
  --debug \
  velero_download.tar.gz
```


# Configuring the Data Protection Application

You can configure the Data Protection Application by setting Velero resource allocations or enabling self-signed CA certificates.

## Setting Velero CPU and memory resource allocations

You set the CPU and memory resource allocations for the Velero pod by editing the  DataProtectionApplication custom resource (CR) manifest.

* You must have the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Operator installed.

* Edit the values in the spec.configuration.velero.podConfig.ResourceAllocations block of the DataProtectionApplication CR manifest, as in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
metadata:
  name: <dpa_sample>
spec:
# ...
  configuration:
    velero:
      podConfig:
        nodeSelector: <node_selector> 1
        resourceAllocations: 2
          limits:
            cpu: "1"
            memory: 1024Mi
          requests:
            cpu: 200m
            memory: 256Mi
```

Specify the node selector to be supplied to Velero podSpec.
The resourceAllocations listed are for average usage.

[NOTE]
----
Kopia is an option in OADP 1.3 and later releases. You can use Kopia for file system backups, and Kopia is your only option for Data Mover cases with the built-in Data Mover.
Kopia is more resource intensive than Restic, and you might need to adjust the CPU and memory requirements accordingly.
----

Use the nodeSelector field to select which nodes can run the node agent. The nodeSelector field is the simplest recommended form of node selection constraint. Any label specified must match the labels on each node.

For more details, see Configuring node agents and node labels.

## Enabling self-signed CA certificates

You must enable a self-signed CA certificate for object storage by editing the DataProtectionApplication custom resource (CR) manifest to prevent a certificate signed by unknown authority error.

* You must have the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Operator installed.

* Edit the spec.backupLocations.velero.objectStorage.caCert parameter and spec.backupLocations.velero.config parameters of the DataProtectionApplication CR manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
metadata:
  name: <dpa_sample>
spec:
# ...
  backupLocations:
    - name: default
      velero:
        provider: aws
        default: true
        objectStorage:
          bucket: <bucket>
          prefix: <prefix>
          caCert: <base64_encoded_cert_string> 1
        config:
          insecureSkipTLSVerify: "false" 2
# ...
```

Specify the Base64-encoded CA certificate string.
The insecureSkipTLSVerify configuration can be set to either "true" or "false". If set to "true", SSL/TLS security is disabled. If set to "false", SSL/TLS security is enabled.

### Using CA certificates with the velero command aliased for Velero deployment

You might want to use the Velero CLI without installing it locally on your system by creating an alias for it.

* You must be logged in to the OpenShift Container Platform cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You must have the OpenShift CLI (oc) installed.

1. To use an aliased Velero command, run the following command:

```terminal
$ alias velero='oc -n openshift-adp exec deployment/velero -c velero -it -- ./velero'
```

2. Check that the alias is working by running the following command:
Example

```terminal
$ velero version
Client:
	Version: v1.12.1-OADP
	Git commit: -
Server:
	Version: v1.12.1-OADP
```

3. To use a CA certificate with this command, you can add a certificate to the Velero deployment by running the following commands:

```terminal
$ CA_CERT=$(oc -n openshift-adp get dataprotectionapplications.oadp.openshift.io <dpa-name> -o jsonpath='{.spec.backupLocations[0].velero.objectStorage.caCert}')

$ [[ -n $CA_CERT ]] && echo "$CA_CERT" | base64 -d | oc exec -n openshift-adp -i deploy/velero -c velero -- bash -c "cat > /tmp/your-cacert.txt" || echo "DPA BSL has no caCert"
```


```terminal
$ velero describe backup <backup_name> --details --cacert /tmp/<your_cacert>.txt
```

4. To fetch the backup logs, run the following command:

```terminal
$ velero backup logs  <backup_name>  --cacert /tmp/<your_cacert.txt>
```


You can use these logs to view failures and warnings for the resources that you cannot back up.
5. If the Velero pod restarts, the /tmp/your-cacert.txt file disappears, and you must re-create the /tmp/your-cacert.txt file by re-running the commands from the previous step.
6. You can check if the /tmp/your-cacert.txt file still exists, in the file location where you stored it, by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc exec -n openshift-adp -i deploy/velero -c velero -- bash -c "ls /tmp/your-cacert.txt"
/tmp/your-cacert.txt
```


In a future release of OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP), we plan to mount the certificate to the Velero pod so that this step is not required.

# Installing the Data Protection Application

You install the Data Protection Application (DPA) by creating an instance of the DataProtectionApplication API.

* You must install the OADP Operator.
* You must configure object storage as a backup location.
* If you use snapshots to back up PVs, your cloud provider must support either a native snapshot API or Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots.
* If the backup and snapshot locations use the same credentials, you must create a Secret with the default name, cloud-credentials.
* If the backup and snapshot locations use different credentials, you must create a Secret with the default name, cloud-credentials, which contains separate profiles for the backup and snapshot location credentials.

[NOTE]
----
If you do not want to specify backup or snapshot locations during the installation, you can create a default Secret with an empty credentials-velero file. If there is no default Secret, the installation will fail.
----

1. Click Operators -> Installed Operators and select the OADP Operator.
2. Under Provided APIs, click Create instance in the DataProtectionApplication box.
3. Click YAML View and update the parameters of the DataProtectionApplication manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
metadata:
  name: <dpa_sample>
  namespace: openshift-adp 1
spec:
  configuration:

The default namespace for OADP is openshift-adp. The namespace is a variable and is configurable.
The openshift plugin is mandatory.
Specify how many minutes to wait for several Velero resources before timeout occurs, such as Velero CRD availability, volumeSnapshot deletion, and backup repository availability. The default is 10m.
The administrative agent that routes the administrative requests to servers.
Set this value to true if you want to enable nodeAgent and perform File System Backup.
Enter kopia or restic as your uploader. You cannot change the selection after the installation. For the Built-in DataMover you must use Kopia. The nodeAgent deploys a daemon set, which means that the nodeAgent pods run on each working node. You can configure File System Backup by adding spec.defaultVolumesToFsBackup: true to the Backup CR.
Specify the nodes on which Kopia or Restic are available. By default, Kopia or Restic run on all nodes.
Specify a bucket as the backup storage location. If the bucket is not a dedicated bucket for Velero backups, you must specify a prefix.
Specify a prefix for Velero backups, for example, velero, if the bucket is used for multiple purposes.
Specify whether to force path style URLs for S3 objects (Boolean). Not Required for AWS S3. Required only for S3 compatible storage.
Specify the URL of the object store that you are using to store backups. Not required for AWS S3. Required only for S3 compatible storage.
Specify the name of the Secret object that you created. If you do not specify this value, the default name, cloud-credentials, is used. If you specify a custom name, the custom name is used for the backup location.
Specify a snapshot location, unless you use CSI snapshots or a File System Backup (FSB) to back up PVs.
The snapshot location must be in the same region as the PVs.
Specify the name of the Secret object that you created. If you do not specify this value, the default name, cloud-credentials, is used. If you specify a custom name, the custom name is used for the snapshot location. If your backup and snapshot locations use different credentials, create separate profiles in the credentials-velero file.

3. Verify the type is set to Reconciled.
4. Verify the backup storage location and confirm that the PHASE is Available by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get backupstoragelocations.velero.io -n openshift-adp
```

Example output

```yaml

dpa-sample-1   Available   1s               3d16h   true
```


## Configuring node agents and node labels

The Data Protection Application (DPA) uses the nodeSelector field to select which nodes can run the node agent. The nodeSelector field is the recommended form of node selection constraint.

1. Run the node agent on any node that you choose by adding a custom label:

```terminal
$ oc label node/<node_name> node-role.kubernetes.io/nodeAgent=""
```


[NOTE]
----
Any label specified must match the labels on each node.
----
2. Use the same custom label in the DPA.spec.configuration.nodeAgent.podConfig.nodeSelector field, which you used for labeling nodes:

```terminal
configuration:
  nodeAgent:
    enable: true
    podConfig:
      nodeSelector:
        node-role.kubernetes.io/nodeAgent: ""
```


The following example is an anti-pattern of nodeSelector and does not work unless both labels, node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: "" and node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: "", are on the node:

```terminal
    configuration:
      nodeAgent:
        enable: true
        podConfig:
          nodeSelector:
            node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: ""
            node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ""
```


# Configuring the backup storage location with a MD5 checksum algorithm

You can configure the Backup Storage Location (BSL) in the Data Protection Application (DPA) to use a MD5 checksum algorithm for both Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and S3-compatible storage providers. The checksum algorithm calculates the checksum for uploading and downloading objects to Amazon S3. You can use one of the following options to set the checksumAlgorithm field in the spec.backupLocations.velero.config.checksumAlgorithm section of the DPA.

* CRC32
* CRC32C
* SHA1
* SHA256


[NOTE]
----
You can also set the checksumAlgorithm field to an empty value to skip the MD5 checksum check.
If you do not set a value for the checksumAlgorithm field, then the default value is set to CRC32.
----

* You have installed the OADP Operator.
* You have configured Amazon S3, or S3-compatible object storage as a backup location.

* Configure the BSL in the DPA as shown in the following example:
Example Data Protection Application

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
metadata:
  name: test-dpa
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  backupLocations:
  - name: default
    velero:
      config:
        checksumAlgorithm: "" 1
        insecureSkipTLSVerify: "true"
        profile: "default"
        region: <bucket_region>
        s3ForcePathStyle: "true"
        s3Url: <bucket_url>
      credential:
        key: cloud
        name: cloud-credentials
      default: true
      objectStorage:
        bucket: <bucket_name>
        prefix: velero
      provider: aws
  configuration:
    velero:
      defaultPlugins:
      - openshift
      - aws
      - csi
```

Specify the checksumAlgorithm. In this example, the checksumAlgorithm field is set to an empty value. You can select an option from the following list: CRC32, CRC32C, SHA1, SHA256.


[IMPORTANT]
----
If you are using Noobaa as the object storage provider, and you do not set the spec.backupLocations.velero.config.checksumAlgorithm field in the DPA, an empty value of checksumAlgorithm is added to the BSL configuration.
The empty value is only added for BSLs that are created using the DPA. This value is not added if you create the BSL by using any other method.
----

# Configuring the DPA with client burst and QPS settings

The burst setting determines how many requests can be sent to the velero server before the limit is applied. After the burst limit is reached, the queries per second (QPS) setting determines how many additional requests can be sent per second.

You can set the burst and QPS values of the velero server by configuring the Data Protection Application (DPA) with the burst and QPS values. You can use the dpa.configuration.velero.client-burst and dpa.configuration.velero.client-qps fields of the DPA to set the burst and QPS values.

* You have installed the OADP Operator.

* Configure the client-burst and the client-qps fields in the DPA as shown in the following example:
Example Data Protection Application

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
metadata:
  name: test-dpa
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  backupLocations:
    - name: default
      velero:
        config:
          insecureSkipTLSVerify: "true"
          profile: "default"
          region: <bucket_region>
          s3ForcePathStyle: "true"
          s3Url: <bucket_url>
        credential:
          key: cloud
          name: cloud-credentials
        default: true
        objectStorage:
          bucket: <bucket_name>
          prefix: velero
        provider: aws
  configuration:
    nodeAgent:
      enable: true
      uploaderType: restic
    velero:
      client-burst: 500 1
      client-qps: 300 2
      defaultPlugins:
        - openshift
        - aws
        - kubevirt
```

Specify the client-burst value. In this example, the client-burst field is set to 500.
Specify the client-qps value. In this example, the client-qps field is set to 300.

# Configuring node agent load affinity

You can schedule the node agent pods on specific nodes by using the spec.podConfig.nodeSelector object of the DataProtectionApplication (DPA) custom resource (CR).

See the following example in which you can schedule the node agent pods on nodes with the label label.io/role: cpu-1 and other-label.io/other-role: cpu-2.


```yaml
...
spec:
  configuration:
    nodeAgent:
      enable: true
      uploaderType: kopia
      podConfig:
        nodeSelector:
          label.io/role: cpu-1
          other-label.io/other-role: cpu-2
        ...
```


You can add more restrictions on the node agent pods scheduling by using the nodeagent.loadAffinity object in the DPA spec.

* You must be logged in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* You have installed the OADP Operator.
* You have configured the DPA CR.

* Configure the DPA spec nodegent.loadAffinity object as shown in the following example.

In the example, you ensure that the node agent pods are scheduled only on nodes with the label label.io/role: cpu-1 and the label label.io/hostname matching with either node1 or node2.

```yaml
...
spec:
  configuration:
    nodeAgent:
      enable: true
      loadAffinity: 1
        - nodeSelector:
            matchLabels:
              label.io/role: cpu-1
            matchExpressions: 2
              - key: label.io/hostname
                operator: In
                values:
                  - node1
                  - node2
                  ...
```

Configure the loadAffinity object by adding the matchLabels and matchExpressions objects.
Configure the matchExpressions object to add restrictions on the node agent pods scheduling.

# Node agent load affinity guidelines

Use the following guidelines to configure the node agent loadAffinity object in the DataProtectionApplication (DPA) custom resource (CR).

* Use the spec.nodeagent.podConfig.nodeSelector object for simple node matching.
* Use the loadAffinity.nodeSelector object without the podConfig.nodeSelector object for more complex scenarios.
* You can use both podConfig.nodeSelector and loadAffinity.nodeSelector objects, but the loadAffinity object must be equal or more restrictive as compared to the podConfig object. In this scenario, the podConfig.nodeSelector labels must be a subset of the labels used in the loadAffinity.nodeSelector object.
* You cannot use the matchExpressions and matchLabels fields if you have configured both podConfig.nodeSelector and loadAffinity.nodeSelector objects in the DPA.
* See the following example to configure both podConfig.nodeSelector and loadAffinity.nodeSelector objects in the DPA.

```yaml
...
spec:
  configuration:
    nodeAgent:
      enable: true
      uploaderType: kopia
      loadAffinity:
        - nodeSelector:
            matchLabels:
              label.io/location: 'US'
              label.io/gpu: 'no'
      podConfig:
        nodeSelector:
          label.io/gpu: 'no'
```


# Configuring node agent load concurrency

You can control the maximum number of node agent operations that can run simultaneously on each node within your cluster.

You can configure it using one of the following fields of the Data Protection Application (DPA):

* globalConfig: Defines a default concurrency limit for the node agent across all nodes.
* perNodeConfig: Specifies different concurrency limits for specific nodes based on nodeSelector labels. This provides flexibility for environments where certain nodes might have different resource capacities or roles.

* You must be logged in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

1. If you want to use load concurrency for specific nodes, add labels to those nodes:

```terminal
$ oc label node/<node_name> label.io/instance-type='large'
```

2. Configure the load concurrency fields for your DPA instance:

```yaml
  configuration:
    nodeAgent:
      enable: true
      uploaderType: kopia
      loadConcurrency:
        globalConfig: 1 1
        perNodeConfig:
        - nodeSelector:
              matchLabels:
                 label.io/instance-type: large 2
          number: 3 3
```

Global concurrent number. The default value is 1, which means there is no concurrency and only one load is allowed. The globalConfig value does not have a limit.
Label for per-node concurrency.
Per-node concurrent number. You can specify many per-node concurrent numbers, for example, based on the instance type and size. The range of per-node concurrent number is the same as the global concurrent number. If the configuration file contains a per-node concurrent number and a global concurrent number, the per-node concurrent number takes precedence.

# Configuring the node agent as a non-root and non-privileged user

To enhance the node agent security, you can configure the OADP Operator node agent daemonset to run as a non-root and non-privileged user by using the spec.configuration.velero.disableFsBackup setting in the DataProtectionApplication (DPA) custom resource (CR).

By setting the spec.configuration.velero.disableFsBackup setting to true, the node agent security context sets the root file system to read-only and sets the privileged flag to false.


[NOTE]
----
Setting spec.configuration.velero.disableFsBackup to true enhances the node agent security by removing the need for privileged containers and enforcing a read-only root file system.
However, it also disables File System Backup (FSB) with Kopia. If your workloads rely on FSB for backing up volumes that do not support native snapshots, then you should evaluate whether the disableFsBackup configuration fits your use case.
----

* You have installed the OADP Operator.

* Configure the disableFsBackup field in the DPA as shown in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
metadata:
  name: ts-dpa
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  backupLocations:
  - velero:
      credential:
        key: cloud
        name: cloud-credentials
      default: true
      objectStorage:
        bucket: <bucket_name>
        prefix: velero
      provider: gcp
  configuration:
    nodeAgent: 1
      enable: true
      uploaderType: kopia
    velero:
      defaultPlugins:
      - csi
      - gcp
      - openshift
      disableFsBackup: true 2
```

Enable the node agent in the DPA.
Set the disableFsBackup field to true.

1. Verify that the node agent security context is set to run as non-root and the root file system is readOnly by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get daemonset node-agent -o yaml
```


The example output is as following:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  ...
  name: node-agent
  namespace: openshift-adp
  ...
spec:
  ...
  template:
    metadata:
      ...
    spec:
      containers:
      ...
        securityContext:
          allowPrivilegeEscalation: false 1
          capabilities:
            drop:
            - ALL
          privileged: false 2
          readOnlyRootFilesystem: true 3
        ...
      nodeSelector:
        kubernetes.io/os: linux
      os:
        name: linux
      restartPolicy: Always
      schedulerName: default-scheduler
      securityContext:
        runAsNonRoot: true 4
        seccompProfile:
          type: RuntimeDefault
      serviceAccount: velero
      serviceAccountName: velero
      ....
```

The allowPrivilegeEscalation field is false.
The privileged field is false.
The root file system is read-only.
The node agent is run as a non-root user.

# Configuring repository maintenance

OADP repository maintenance is a background job, you can configure it independently of the node agent pods. This means that you can schedule the repository maintenance pod on a node where the node agent is or is not running.

You can use the repository maintenance job affinity configurations in the DataProtectionApplication (DPA) custom resource (CR) only if you use Kopia as the backup repository.

You have the option to configure the load affinity at the global level affecting all repositories. Or you can configure the load affinity for each repository. You can also use a combination of global and per-repository configuration.

* You must be logged in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* You have installed the OADP Operator.
* You have configured the DPA CR.

* Configure the loadAffinity object in the DPA spec by using either one or both of the following methods:
* Global configuration: Configure load affinity for all repositories as shown in the following example:

```yaml
...
spec:
  configuration:
    repositoryMaintenance: 1
      global: 2
        podResources:
          cpuRequest: "100m"
          cpuLimit: "200m"
          memoryRequest: "100Mi"
          memoryLimit: "200Mi"
        loadAffinity:
          - nodeSelector:
              matchLabels:
                label.io/gpu: 'no'
              matchExpressions:
                - key: label.io/location
                  operator: In
                  values:
                    - US
                    - EU
```

Configure the repositoryMaintenance object as shown in the example.
Use the global object to configure load affinity for all repositories.
* Per-repository configuration: Configure load affinity per repository as shown in the following example:

```yaml
...
spec:
  configuration:
    repositoryMaintenance:
      myrepositoryname: 1
        loadAffinity:
          - nodeSelector:
              matchLabels:
                label.io/cpu: 'yes'
```

Configure the repositoryMaintenance object for each repository.

# Configuring Velero load affinity

With each OADP deployment, there is one Velero pod and its main purpose is to schedule Velero workloads. To schedule the Velero pod, you can use the velero.podConfig.nodeSelector and the velero.loadAffinity objects in the DataProtectionApplication (DPA) custom resource (CR) spec.

Use the podConfig.nodeSelector object to assign the Velero pod to specific nodes. You can also configure the velero.loadAffinity object for pod-level affinity and anti-affinity.

The OpenShift scheduler applies the rules and performs the scheduling of the Velero pod deployment.

* You must be logged in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* You have installed the OADP Operator.
* You have configured the DPA CR.

* Configure the velero.podConfig.nodeSelector and the velero.loadAffinity objects in the DPA spec as shown in the following examples:
* velero.podConfig.nodeSelector object configuration:

```yaml
...
spec:
  configuration:
    velero:
      podConfig:
        nodeSelector:
          some-label.io/custom-node-role: backup-core
```

* velero.loadAffinity object configuration:

```yaml
...
spec:
  configuration:
    velero:
      loadAffinity:
        - nodeSelector:
            matchLabels:
              label.io/gpu: 'no'
            matchExpressions:
              - key: label.io/location
                operator: In
                values:
                  - US
                  - EU
```


# Overriding the imagePullPolicy setting in the DPA

In OADP 1.4.0 or earlier, the Operator sets the imagePullPolicy field of the Velero and node agent pods to Always for all images.

In OADP 1.4.1 or later, the Operator first checks if each image has the sha256 or sha512 digest and sets the imagePullPolicy field accordingly:

* If the image has the digest, the Operator sets imagePullPolicy to IfNotPresent.
* If the image does not have the digest, the Operator sets imagePullPolicy to Always.

You can also override the imagePullPolicy field by using the spec.imagePullPolicy field in the Data Protection Application (DPA).

* You have installed the OADP Operator.

* Configure the spec.imagePullPolicy field in the DPA as shown in the following example:
Example Data Protection Application

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
metadata:
  name: test-dpa
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  backupLocations:
    - name: default
      velero:
        config:
          insecureSkipTLSVerify: "true"
          profile: "default"
          region: <bucket_region>
          s3ForcePathStyle: "true"
          s3Url: <bucket_url>
        credential:
          key: cloud
          name: cloud-credentials
        default: true
        objectStorage:
          bucket: <bucket_name>
          prefix: velero
        provider: aws
  configuration:
    nodeAgent:
      enable: true
      uploaderType: kopia
    velero:
      defaultPlugins:
        - openshift
        - aws
        - kubevirt
        - csi
  imagePullPolicy: Never 1
```

Specify the value for imagePullPolicy. In this example, the imagePullPolicy field is set to Never.

# Configuring the DPA with more than one BSL

You can configure the DataProtectionApplication (DPA) custom resource (CR) with more than one BackupStorageLocation (BSL) CR and specify the credentials provided by the cloud provider.

For example, where you have configured the following two BSLs:

* Configured one BSL in the DPA and set it as the default BSL.
* Created another BSL independently by using the BackupStorageLocation CR.

As you have already set the BSL created through the DPA as the default, you cannot set the independently created BSL again as the default. This means, at any given time, you can set only one BSL as the default BSL.

* You must install the OADP Operator.
* You must create the secrets by using the credentials provided by the cloud provider.

1. Configure the DataProtectionApplication CR with more than one BackupStorageLocation CR. See the following example:
Example DPA

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
#...
backupLocations:
  - name: aws 1
    velero:
      provider: aws
      default: true 2
      objectStorage:
        bucket: <bucket_name> 3
        prefix: <prefix> 4
      config:
        region: <region_name> 5
        profile: "default"
      credential:
        key: cloud
        name: cloud-credentials 6
  - name: odf 7
    velero:
      provider: aws
      default: false
      objectStorage:
        bucket: <bucket_name>
        prefix: <prefix>
      config:
        profile: "default"
        region: <region_name>
        s3Url: <url> 8
        insecureSkipTLSVerify: "true"
        s3ForcePathStyle: "true"
      credential:
        key: cloud
        name: <custom_secret_name_odf> 9
#...
```

Specify a name for the first BSL.
This parameter indicates that this BSL is the default BSL. If a BSL is not set in the Backup CR, the default BSL is used. You can set only one BSL as the default.
Specify the bucket name.
Specify a prefix for Velero backups; for example, velero.
Specify the AWS region for the bucket.
Specify the name of the default Secret object that you created.
Specify a name for the second BSL.
Specify the URL of the S3 endpoint.
Specify the correct name for the Secret; for example, custom_secret_name_odf. If you do not specify a Secret name, the default name is used.
2. Specify the BSL to be used in the backup CR. See the following example.
Example backup CR

```yaml
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Backup
# ...
spec:
  includedNamespaces:
  - <namespace> 1
  storageLocation: <backup_storage_location> 2
  defaultVolumesToFsBackup: true
```

Specify the namespace to back up.
Specify the storage location.

## Enabling CSI in the DataProtectionApplication CR

You enable the Container Storage Interface (CSI) in the DataProtectionApplication custom resource (CR) in order to back up persistent volumes with CSI snapshots.

* The cloud provider must support CSI snapshots.

* Edit the DataProtectionApplication CR, as in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
...
spec:
  configuration:
    velero:
      defaultPlugins:
      - openshift
      - csi 1
```

Add the csi default plugin.

## Disabling the node agent in DataProtectionApplication

If you are not using Restic, Kopia, or DataMover for your backups, you can disable the nodeAgent field in the DataProtectionApplication custom resource (CR). Before you disable nodeAgent, ensure the OADP Operator is idle and not running any backups.

1. To disable the nodeAgent, set the enable flag to false. See the following example:
Example DataProtectionApplication CR

```yaml
# ...
configuration:
  nodeAgent:
    enable: false  1
    uploaderType: kopia
# ...
```

Disables the node agent.
2. To enable the nodeAgent, set the enable flag to true. See the following example:
Example DataProtectionApplication CR

```yaml
# ...
configuration:
  nodeAgent:
    enable: true  1
    uploaderType: kopia
# ...
```

Enables the node agent.

You can set up a job to enable and disable the nodeAgent field in the DataProtectionApplication CR. For more information, see "Running tasks in pods using jobs".
