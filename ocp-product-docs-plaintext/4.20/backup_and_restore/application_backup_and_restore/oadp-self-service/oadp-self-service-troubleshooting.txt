# OADP Self-Service troubleshooting


You can use the following sections to troubleshoot common errors when using OADP Self-Service.

# Error NonAdminBackupStorageLocation not found in the namespace

Consider the following scenario of a namespace admin backup:

* You have created two NonAdminBackupStorageLocations (NABLs) custom resources (CRs) in two different namespaces, for example, nabsl-1 in namespace-1 and nabsl-2 in namespace-2.
* You are taking a backup of namespace-1 and use nabsl-2 in the NonAdminBackup (NAB) CR.

In this scenario, after creating the NAB CR, you get the following error:


```text
NonAdminBackupStorageLocation not found in the namespace: NonAdminBackupStorageLocation.oadp.openshift.io
```


The cause of the error is that the NABSL CR does not belong to the namespace that you are trying to back up.


```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: NonAdminBackup
...
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-02-20T10:13:00Z"
  message: 'NonAdminBackupStorageLocation not found in the namespace: NonAdminBackupStorageLocation.oadp.openshift.io
    "nabsl2" not found'
  reason: InvalidBackupSpec
  status: "False"
  type: Accepted
  phase: BackingOff
```


Use the NABSL that belongs to the same namespace that you are trying to back up.

In this scenario, you must use nabsl-1 in the NAB CR to back up namespace-1.

# NonAdminBackupStorageLocation cannot be set as default

As a non-admin user, if you have created a NonAdminBackupStorageLocation (NABSL) custom resource (CR) in your authorized namespace, you cannot set the NABSL CR as the default backup storage location.

In such a scenario, the NABSL CR fails to validate and the NonAdminController (NAC) gives an error message.


```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: NonAdminBackupStorageLocation
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "20...:03Z"
  generation: 1
  name: nabsl1
  namespace: test-nac-1
  resourceVersion: "11...9"
  uid: 8d2fc....c9b6c4401
spec:
  backupStorageLocationSpec:
    credential:
      key: cloud
      name: cloud-credentials-gcp
    default: true 1
    objectStorage:
      bucket: oad..7l8
      prefix: velero
    provider: gcp
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "20...:27:03Z"
    message: NonAdminBackupStorageLocation cannot be used as a default BSL 2
    reason: BslSpecValidation
    status: "False"
    type: Accepted
  phase: BackingOff
```


The value of the default field is set to true.
The error message reported by NAC.

To successfully validate and reconcile the NABSL CR, ensure that the default field is set to false in the NABSL CR.
