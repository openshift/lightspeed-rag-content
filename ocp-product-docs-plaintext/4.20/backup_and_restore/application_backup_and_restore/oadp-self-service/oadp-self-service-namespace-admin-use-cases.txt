# OADP Self-Service namespace admin use cases


As a namespace admin user, you can use the Self-Service feature in the following scenarios:
* Create a backup storage location in your authorized namespace.
* Create a NonAdminBackup (NAB) custom resource (CR).
* Create a NonAdminRestore (NAR) CR.
* Review NAB and NAR logs.

# Creating a NonAdminBackupStorageLocation CR

You can create a NonAdminBackupStorageLocation (NABSL) custom resource (CR) in your authorized namespace. After the cluster administrator approves the NABSL CR request, you can use the NABSL CR in the NonAdminBackup CR spec.

* You are logged in to the cluster as a namespace admin user.
* The cluster administrator has installed the OADP Operator.
* The cluster administrator has configured the DataProtectionApplication (DPA) CR to enable OADP Self-Service.
* The cluster administrator has created a namespace for you and has authorized you to operate from that namespace.

1. Create a Secret CR by using the cloud credentials file content for your cloud provider. Run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create secret generic cloud-credentials -n test-nac-ns --from-file <cloud_key_name>=<cloud_credentials_file> 1
```

In this example, the Secret name is cloud-credentials and the authorized namespace name is test-nac-ns. Replace <cloud_key_name> and <cloud_credentials_file> with your cloud key name and the cloud credentials file name, respectively.
2. To create a NonAdminBackupStorageLocation CR, create a YAML manifest file with the following configuration:
Example NonAdminBackupStorageLocation CR

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: NonAdminBackupStorageLocation
metadata:
  name: test-nabsl
  namespace: test-nac-ns 1
spec:
  backupStorageLocationSpec:
    config:
      profile: default
      region: <region_name> 2
    credential:
      key: cloud
      name: cloud-credentials
    objectStorage:
      bucket: <bucket_name> 3
      prefix: velero
    provider: aws
```

Specify the namespace you are authorized to operate from. For example, test-nac-ns.
Replace <region_name> with a region name.
Replace <bucket_name> with a bucket name.
3. To apply the NABSL CR configuration, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <nabsl_cr_filename> 1
```

Replace <nabsl_cr_filename> with the file name containing the NABSL CR configuration.

1. To verify that the NABSL CR is in the New phase and is pending administrator approval, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get nabsl test-nabsl -o yaml
```

Example output

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: NonAdminBackupStorageLocation
...
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-02-26T09:07:15Z"
    message: NonAdminBackupStorageLocation spec validation successful
    reason: BslSpecValidation
    status: "True"
    type: Accepted
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-02-26T09:07:15Z"
    message: NonAdminBackupStorageLocationRequest approval pending 1
    reason: BslSpecApprovalPending
    status: "False"
    type: ClusterAdminApproved
  phase: New 2
  veleroBackupStorageLocation:
    nacuuid: test-nac-test-bsl-c...d4389a1930
    name: test-nac-test-bsl-cd....1930
    namespace: openshift-adp
```

Defines that the status.conditions.message field contains the NonAdminBackupStorageLocationRequest approval pending message .
Defines that the status of a phase is New.
2. After the cluster administrator approves the NonAdminBackupStorageLocationRequest CR request, verify that the NABSL CR is successfully created by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get nabsl test-nabsl -o yaml
```

Example output

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1

# Creating a NonAdminBackup CR

As a namespace admin user, you can create a NonAdminBackup (NAB) custom resource (CR) to back up your application from your authorized namespace. NAB is an {product-title} CR that securely facilitates the creation of a Velero backup object. The Velero backup object reports the status back to the NAB CR that ultimately updates the status.phase field.

After you create a NAB CR, the CR undergoes the following phases:

* The initial phase for the CR is New.
* The CR creation request goes to the NonAdminController (NAC) for reconciliation and validation.
* Upon successful validation and creation of the Velero backup object, the status.phase field of the NAB CR is updated to the next phase, which is, Created.

Review the following important points when creating a NAB CR:

* The NonAdminBackup CR creates the Velero backup object securely so that other namespace admin users cannot access the CR.
* As a namespace admin user, you can only specify your authorized namespace in the NAB CR. You get an error when you specify a namespace you are not authorized to use.

* You are logged in to the cluster as a namespace admin user.
* The cluster administrator has installed the OADP Operator.
* The cluster administrator has configured the DataProtectionApplication (DPA) CR to enable OADP Self-Service.
* The cluster administrator has created a namespace for you and has authorized you to operate from that namespace.
* Optional: You can create and use a NonAdminBackupStorageLocation (NABSL) CR to store the backup data. If you do not use a NABSL CR, then the backup is stored in the default backup storage location configured in the DPA.

1. To create a NonAdminBackup CR, create a YAML manifest file with the following configuration:
Example NonAdminBackup CR

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: NonAdminBackup
metadata:
  name: test-nab 1
spec:
  backupSpec:
    defaultVolumesToFsBackup: true 2
    snapshotMoveData: false 3
    storageLocation: test-bsl 4
```

Specify a name for the NAB CR, for example, test-nab.
To use File System Backup (FSB), set defaultVolumesToFsBackup to true.
If you want to backup your data volumes by using the Data Mover, set the snapshotMoveData to true. This example uses the FSB for backup.
Optionally, set a NABSL CR as a storage location. If you do not set a storageLocation, then the default backup storage location configured in the DPA is used.
2. To apply the NAB CR configuration, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <nab_cr_filename> 1
```

Specify the file name containing the NAB CR configuration.

* To verify that the NAB CR is successfully created, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get nab test-nab -o yaml
```

Example output

```yaml

The status of the Velero backup object.
The Velero backup object is in the Completed phase and the backup is successful.

# Creating a NonAdminRestore CR

As a namespace admin user, to restore a backup, you can create a NonAdminRestore (NAR) custom resource (CR). The backup is restored to your authorized namespace.

* You are logged in to the cluster as a namespace admin user.
* The cluster administrator has installed the OADP Operator.
* The cluster administrator has configured the DataProtectionApplication (DPA) CR to enable OADP Self-Service.
* The cluster administrator has created a namespace for you and has authorized you to operate from that namespace.
* You have a backup of your application by creating a NonAdminBackup (NAB) CR.

1. To create a NonAdminRestore CR, create a YAML manifest file with the following configuration:
Example NonAdminRestore CR

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: NonAdminRestore
metadata:
  name: test-nar 1
spec:
  restoreSpec:
    backupName: test-nab 2
```

Defines a name for the NAR CR, for example, test-nar.
Defines the name of the NAB CR you want to restore from. For example, test-nab.
2. To apply the NAR CR configuration, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <nar_cr_filename> 1
```

Replace <nar_cr_filename> with the file name containing the NAR CR configuration.

1. To verify that the NAR CR is successfully created, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get nar test-nar -o yaml
```

Example output

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: NonAdminRestore

The Velero restore object is in the Completed phase and the restore is successful.

# About NonAdminDownloadRequest CR

As a namespace admin user, you can use the NonAdminDownloadRequest (NADR) custom resource (CR) to access detailed information about your backups and restores for troubleshooting.

This CR provides information that is equivalent to what a cluster administrator can access by using the velero backup describe --details command.

After the NADR CR request is validated, a secure download URL is generated to access the requested information.

You can download the following NADR resources:



# Reviewing NAB and NAR logs

As a namespace admin user, you can review the logs for the NonAdminBackup (NAB) and NonAdminRestore (NAR) custom resources (CRs) by creating a NonAdminDownloadRequest (NADR) CR.


[NOTE]
----
You can review the NAB logs only if you are using a NonAdminBackupStorageLocation (NABSL) CR as a backup storage location for the backup.
----

* You are logged in to the cluster as a namespace admin user.
* The cluster administrator has installed the OADP Operator.
* The cluster administrator has configured the DataProtectionApplication (DPA) CR to enable OADP Self-Service.
* The cluster administrator has created a namespace for you and has authorized you to operate from that namespace.
* You have a backup of your application by creating a NAB CR.
* You have restored the application by creating a NAR CR.

1. To review NAB CR logs, create a NonAdminDownloadRequest CR and specify the NAB CR name as shown in the following example:
Example NonAdminDownloadRequest CR

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: NonAdminDownloadRequest
metadata:
  name: test-nadr-backup
spec:
  target:
    kind: BackupLog 1
    name: test-nab 2
```

Specify BackupLog as the value for the kind field of the NADR CR.
Specify the name of the NAB CR.
2. Verify that the NADR CR is processed by running the following command.

```terminal
$ oc get nadr test-nadr-backup -o yaml
```
