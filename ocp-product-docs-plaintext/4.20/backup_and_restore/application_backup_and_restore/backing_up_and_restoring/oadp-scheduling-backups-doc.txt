# Scheduling backups using Schedule CR

The schedule operation allows you to create a backup of your data at a particular time, specified by a Cron expression.

You schedule backups by creating a Schedule custom resource (CR) instead of a Backup CR.


[WARNING]
----
Leave enough time in your backup schedule for a backup to finish before another backup is created.
For example, if a backup of a namespace typically takes 10 minutes, do not schedule backups more frequently than every 15 minutes.
----

* You must install the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Operator.
* The DataProtectionApplication CR must be in a Ready state.

1. Retrieve the backupStorageLocations CRs:

```terminal
$ oc get backupStorageLocations -n openshift-adp
```

Example output

```terminal
NAMESPACE       NAME              PHASE       LAST VALIDATED   AGE   DEFAULT
openshift-adp   velero-sample-1   Available   11s              31m
```

2. Create a Schedule CR, as in the following example:

```yaml
$ cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Schedule
metadata:
  name: <schedule>
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  schedule: 0 7 * * * 1
  template:
    hooks: {}
    includedNamespaces:
    - <namespace> 2
    storageLocation: <velero-sample-1> 3
    defaultVolumesToFsBackup: true 4
    ttl: 720h0m0s
EOF
```


cron expression to schedule the backup, for example, 0 7 * * * to perform a backup every day at 7:00.

[NOTE]
----
To schedule a backup at specific intervals, enter the <duration_in_minutes> in the following format:

```terminal
  schedule: "*/10 * * * *"
```

Enter the minutes value between quotation marks (" ").
----
Array of namespaces to back up.
Name of the backupStorageLocations CR.
Optional: In OADP version 1.2 and later, add the defaultVolumesToFsBackup: true key-value pair to your configuration when performing backups of volumes with Restic. In OADP version 1.1, add the defaultVolumesToRestic: true key-value pair when you back up volumes with Restic.

* Verify that the status of the Schedule CR is Completed after the scheduled backup runs:

```terminal
$ oc get schedule -n openshift-adp <schedule> -o jsonpath='{.status.phase}'
```
