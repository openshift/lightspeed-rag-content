# Creating a Backup CR



You back up Kubernetes resources, internal images, and persistent volumes (PVs) by creating a Backup custom resource (CR).

* You must install the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Operator.
* The DataProtectionApplication CR must be in a Ready state.
* Backup location prerequisites:
* You must have S3 object storage configured for Velero.
* You must have a backup location configured in the DataProtectionApplication CR.
* Snapshot location prerequisites:
* Your cloud provider must have a native snapshot API or support Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots.
* For CSI snapshots, you must create a VolumeSnapshotClass CR to register the CSI driver.
* You must have a volume location configured in the DataProtectionApplication CR.

1. Retrieve the backupStorageLocations CRs by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get backupstoragelocations.velero.io -n openshift-adp
```

Example output

```terminal
NAMESPACE       NAME              PHASE       LAST VALIDATED   AGE   DEFAULT
openshift-adp   velero-sample-1   Available   11s              31m
```

2. Create a Backup CR, as in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: <backup>
  labels:
    velero.io/storage-location: default
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  hooks: {}
  includedNamespaces:
  - <namespace> 1
  includedResources: [] 2
  excludedResources: [] 3
  storageLocation: <velero-sample-1> 4
  ttl: 720h0m0s
  labelSelector: 5
    matchLabels:
      app: <label_1>
      app: <label_2>
      app: <label_3>
  orLabelSelectors: 6
  - matchLabels:
      app: <label_1>
      app: <label_2>
      app: <label_3>
```

Specify an array of namespaces to back up.
Optional: Specify an array of resources to include in the backup. Resources might be shortcuts (for example, 'po' for 'pods') or fully-qualified. If unspecified, all resources are included.
Optional: Specify an array of resources to exclude from the backup. Resources might be shortcuts (for example, 'po' for 'pods') or fully-qualified.
Specify the name of the backupStorageLocations CR.
Map of {key,value} pairs of backup resources that have all the specified labels.
Map of {key,value} pairs of backup resources that have one or more of the specified labels.
3. Verify that the status of the Backup CR is Completed:

```terminal
$ oc get backups.velero.io -n openshift-adp <backup> -o jsonpath='{.status.phase}'
```
