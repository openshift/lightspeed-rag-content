# Backing up workloads on OADP with {product-title}



# Performing a backup with OADP and {product-title}

The following example hello-world application has no persistent volumes (PVs) attached. Perform a backup by using OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) with {product-title}.

Either Data Protection Application (DPA) configuration will work.

1. Create a workload to back up by running the following commands:

```terminal
$ oc create namespace hello-world
```


```terminal
$ oc new-app -n hello-world --image=docker.io/openshift/hello-openshift
```

2. Expose the route by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc expose service/hello-openshift -n hello-world
```

3. Check that the application is working by running the following command:

```terminal
$ curl `oc get route/hello-openshift -n hello-world -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}'`
```

Example output

```terminal
Hello OpenShift!
```

4. Back up the workload by running the following command:

```terminal
$ cat << EOF | oc create -f -
  apiVersion: velero.io/v1
  kind: Backup
  metadata:
    name: hello-world
    namespace: openshift-adp
  spec:
    includedNamespaces:
    - hello-world
    storageLocation: ${CLUSTER_NAME}-dpa-1
    ttl: 720h0m0s
EOF
```

5. Wait until the backup is complete, and then run the following command:

```terminal
$ watch "oc -n openshift-adp get backup hello-world -o json | jq .status"
```

Example output

```json
{
  "completionTimestamp": "2022-09-07T22:20:44Z",
  "expiration": "2022-10-07T22:20:22Z",
  "formatVersion": "1.1.0",
  "phase": "Completed",
  "progress": {
    "itemsBackedUp": 58,
    "totalItems": 58
  },
  "startTimestamp": "2022-09-07T22:20:22Z",
  "version": 1
}
```

6. Delete the demo workload by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete ns hello-world
```

7. Restore the workload from the backup by running the following command:

```terminal
$ cat << EOF | oc create -f -
  apiVersion: velero.io/v1
  kind: Restore
  metadata:
    name: hello-world
    namespace: openshift-adp
  spec:
    backupName: hello-world
EOF
```

8. Wait for the Restore to finish by running the following command:

```terminal
$ watch "oc -n openshift-adp get restore hello-world -o json | jq .status"
```

Example output

```json
{
  "completionTimestamp": "2022-09-07T22:25:47Z",
  "phase": "Completed",
  "progress": {
    "itemsRestored": 38,
    "totalItems": 38
  },
  "startTimestamp": "2022-09-07T22:25:28Z",
  "warnings": 9
}
```

9. Check that the workload is restored by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n hello-world get pods
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hello-openshift-9f885f7c6-kdjpj   1/1     Running   0          90s
```

10. Check the JSONPath by running the following command:

```terminal
$ curl `oc get route/hello-openshift -n hello-world -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}'`
```

Example output

```terminal
Hello OpenShift!
```

# Cleaning up a cluster after a backup with OADP and ROSA STS

If you need to uninstall the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Operator together with the backups and the S3 bucket from this example, follow these instructions.

1. Delete the workload by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete ns hello-world
```

2. Delete the Data Protection Application (DPA) by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-adp delete dpa ${CLUSTER_NAME}-dpa
```

3. Delete the cloud storage by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-adp delete cloudstorage ${CLUSTER_NAME}-oadp
```


[WARNING]
----
If this command hangs, you might need to delete the finalizer by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-adp patch cloudstorage ${CLUSTER_NAME}-oadp -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":null}}' --type=merge
```

----
4. If the Operator is no longer required, remove it by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-adp delete subscription oadp-operator
```

5. Remove the namespace from the Operator:

```terminal
$ oc delete ns openshift-adp
```

6. If the backup and restore resources are no longer required, remove them from the cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete backups.velero.io hello-world
```

7. To delete backup, restore and remote objects in AWS S3 run the following command:

```terminal
$ velero backup delete hello-world
```

8. If you no longer need the Custom Resource Definitions (CRD), remove them from the cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ for CRD in `oc get crds | grep velero | awk '{print $1}'`; do oc delete crd $CRD; done
```

9. Delete the AWS S3 bucket by running the following commands:

```terminal
$ aws s3 rm s3://${CLUSTER_NAME}-oadp --recursive
```


```terminal
$ aws s3api delete-bucket --bucket ${CLUSTER_NAME}-oadp
```

10. Detach the policy from the role by running the following command:

```terminal
$ aws iam detach-role-policy --role-name "${ROLE_NAME}"  --policy-arn "${POLICY_ARN}"
```

11. Delete the role by running the following command:

```terminal
$ aws iam delete-role --role-name "${ROLE_NAME}"
```
