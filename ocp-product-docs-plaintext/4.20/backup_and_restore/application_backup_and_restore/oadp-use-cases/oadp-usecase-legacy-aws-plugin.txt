# Using the legacy-aws Velero plugin


If you are using an AWS S3-compatible backup storage location, you might get a SignatureDoesNotMatch error while backing up your application. This error occurs because some backup storage locations still use the older versions of the S3 APIs, which are incompatible with the newer AWS SDK for Go V2. To resolve this issue, you can use the legacy-aws Velero plugin in the DataProtectionApplication custom resource (CR). The legacy-aws Velero plugin uses the older AWS SDK for Go V1, which is compatible with the legacy S3 APIs, ensuring successful backups.

# Using the legacy-aws Velero plugin in the DataProtectionApplication CR

In the following use case, you configure the DataProtectionApplication CR with the legacy-aws Velero plugin and then back up an application.


[NOTE]
----
Depending on the backup storage location you choose, you can use either the legacy-aws or the aws plugin in your DataProtectionApplication CR. If you use both of the plugins in the DataProtectionApplication CR, the following error occurs: aws and legacy-aws can not be both specified in DPA spec.configuration.velero.defaultPlugins.
----

* You have installed the OADP Operator.
* You have configured an AWS S3-compatible object storage as a backup location.
* You have an application with a database running in a separate namespace.

1. Configure the DataProtectionApplication CR to use the legacy-aws Velero plugin as shown in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
metadata:
  name: oadp-backup
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  configuration:
    nodeAgent:
      enable: true
      uploaderType: kopia
    velero:
      defaultPlugins:
        - legacy-aws
        - openshift
        - csi
      defaultSnapshotMoveData: true
  backupLocations:
    - velero:
        config:
          profile: "default"
          region: noobaa
          s3Url: https://s3.openshift-storage.svc
          s3ForcePathStyle: "true"
          insecureSkipTLSVerify: "true"
        provider: aws
        default: true
        credential:
          key: cloud
          name:  cloud-credentials
        objectStorage:
          bucket: <bucket_name>
          prefix: oadp
```


where:
legacy-aws:: Specifies to use the legacy-aws plugin.
<bucket_name>:: Specifies the bucket name.
2. Create the DataProtectionApplication CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <dpa_filename>
```

3. Verify that the DataProtectionApplication CR is created successfully by running the following command. In the example output, you can see the status object has the type field set to Reconciled and the status field set to "True". That status indicates that the DataProtectionApplication CR is successfully created.

```terminal
$ oc get dpa -o yaml
```

Example output

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
items:
- apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
  kind: DataProtectionApplication
  metadata:
    namespace: openshift-adp
    #...#
  spec:
    backupLocations:
    - velero:
        config:
          #...#
  status:
    conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: "20....9:54:02Z"
      message: Reconcile complete
      reason: Complete
      status: "True"
      type: Reconciled
kind: List
metadata:
  resourceVersion: ""
```

4. Verify that the backup storage location (BSL) is available by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get backupstoragelocations.velero.io -n openshift-adp
```


You should see an output similar to the following example:

```terminal
NAME           PHASE       LAST VALIDATED   AGE   DEFAULT
dpa-sample-1   Available   3s               15s   true
```

5. Configure a Backup CR as shown in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: test-backup
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  includedNamespaces:
  - <application_namespace>
```


where:
<application_namespace>:: Specifies the namespace for the application to back up.
6. Create the Backup CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <backup_cr_filename>
```


* Verify that the backup object is in the Completed phase by running the following command. For more details, see the example output.

```terminal
$ oc describe backups.velero.io test-backup -n openshift-adp
```

Example output

```terminal
Name:         test-backup
Namespace:    openshift-adp
# ....#
Status:
  Backup Item Operations Attempted:  1
  Backup Item Operations Completed:  1
