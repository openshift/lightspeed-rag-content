# OADP 1.5.2 release notes

The OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.5.2 release notes lists resolved issues.

## Resolved issues

Self-signed certificate for internal image backup should not break other BSLs

Before this update, OADP would only process the first custom CA certificate found among all backup storage locations (BSLs) and apply it globally. This behavior prevented multiple BSLs with different CA certificates from working correctly.
Additionally, system-trusted certificates were not included, causing failures when connecting to standard services.
With this update, OADP now:

* Concatenates all unique CA certificates from AWS BSLs into a single bundle.
* Includes system-trusted certificates automatically.
* Enables multiple BSLs with different custom CA certificates to operate simultaneously.
* Only processes CA certificates when image backup is enabled (default behavior).

This enhancement improves compatibility for environments using multiple storage providers with different certificate requirements, particularly when backing up internal images to AWS S3-compatible storage with self-signed certificates.

# OADP 1.5.1 release notes

The OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.5.1 release notes lists new features, resolved issues, known issues, and deprecated features.

## New features

CloudStorage API is fully supported

The CloudStorage API feature, available as a Technology Preview before this update, is fully supported from OADP 1.5.1. The CloudStorage API automates the creation of a bucket for object storage.

OADP-3307

New DataProtectionTest custom resource is available

The DataProtectionTest (DPT) is a custom resource (CR) that provides a framework to validate your OADP configuration. The DPT CR checks and reports information for the following parameters:

* The upload performance of the backups to the object storage.
* The Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshot readiness for persistent volume claims.
* The storage bucket configuration, such as encryption and versioning.

Using this information in the DPT CR, you can ensure that your data protection environment is properly configured and performing according to the set configuration.

Note that you must configure STORAGE_ACCOUNT_ID when using DPT with OADP on Azure.

OADP-6300

New node agent load affinity configurations are available

* Node agent load affinity: You can schedule the node agent pods on specific nodes by using the spec.podConfig.nodeSelector object of the DataProtectionApplication (DPA) custom resource (CR). You can add more restrictions on the node agent pods scheduling by using the nodeagent.loadAffinity object in the DPA spec.
* Repository maintenance job affinity configurations: You can use the repository maintenance job affinity configurations in the DataProtectionApplication (DPA) custom resource (CR) only if you use Kopia as the backup repository.

You have the option to configure the load affinity at the global level affecting all repositories, or for each repository. You can also use a combination of global and per-repository configuration.
* Velero load affinity: You can use the podConfig.nodeSelector object to assign the Velero pod to specific nodes. You can also configure the velero.loadAffinity object for pod-level affinity and anti-affinity.

OADP-5832

Node agent load concurrency is available

With this update, users can control the maximum number of node agent operations that can run simultaneously on each node within their cluster. It also enables better resource management, optimizing backup and restore workflows for improved performance and a more streamlined experience.

## Resolved issues

DataProtectionApplicationSpec overflowed annotation limit, causing potential misconfiguration in deployments

Before this update, the DataProtectionApplicationSpec used deprecated PodAnnotations, which led to an annotation limit overflow. This caused potential misconfigurations in deployments. In this release, we have added PodConfig for annotations in pods deployed by the Operator, ensuring consistent annotations and improved manageability for end users. As a result, deployments should now be more reliable and easier to manage.

OADP-6454

Root file system for OADP controller manager is now read-only

Before this update, the manager container of the openshift-adp-controller-manager-* pod was configured to run with a writable root file system. As a consequence, this could allow for tampering with the container&#8217;s file system or the writing of foreign executables. With this release, the container&#8217;s security context has been updated to set the root file system to read-only while ensuring necessary functions that require write access, such as the Kopia cache, continue to operate correctly. As a result, the container is hardened against potential threats.

nonAdmin.enable: false in multiple DPAs no longer causes reconcile issues

Before this update, when a user attempted to create a second non-admin DataProtectionApplication (DPA) on a cluster where one already existed, the new DPA failed to reconcile. With this release, the restriction on Non-Admin Controller installation to one per cluster has been removed. As a result, users can install multiple Non-Admin Controllers across the cluster without encountering errors.

OADP-6500

OADP supports self-signed certificates

Before this update, using a self-signed certificate for backup images with a storage provider such as Minio resulted in an x509: certificate signed by unknown authority error during the backup process. With this release, certificate validation has been updated to support self-signed certificates in OADP, ensuring successful backups.

OADP-641

velero describe includes defaultVolumesToFsBackup

Before this update, the velero describe output command omitted the defaultVolumesToFsBackup flag. This affected the visibility of backup configuration details for users. With this release, the velero describe output includes the defaultVolumesToFsBackup flag information, improving the visibility of backup settings.

OADP-5762

DPT CR no longer fail when s3Url is secured

Before this update, DataProtectionTest (DPT) failed to run when s3Url was secured due to an unverified certificate because the DPT CR lacked the ability to skip or add the caCert in the spec field. As a consequence, data upload failure occurred due to an unverified certificate. With this release, DPT CR has been updated to accept and skip CA cert in spec field, resolving SSL verification errors. As a result, DPT no longer fails when using secured s3Url.

OADP-6235

Adding a backupLocation to DPA with an existing backupLocation name is not rejected

Before this update, adding a second backupLocation with the same name in DataProtectionApplication (DPA) caused OADP to enter an invalid state, leading to Backup and Restore failures due to Velero&#8217;s inability to read Secret credentials. As a consequence, Backup and Restore operations failed. With this release, the duplicate backupLocation names in DPA are no longer allowed, preventing Backup and Restore failures. As a result, duplicate backupLocation names are rejected, ensuring seamless data protection.

OADP-6459

## Known issues

The restore fails for backups created on OpenStack using the Cinder CSI driver

When you start a restore operation for a backup that was created on an OpenStack platform using the Cinder Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver, the initial backup only succeeds after the source application is manually scaled down. The restore job fails, preventing you from successfully recovering your application&#8217;s data and state from the backup. No known workaround exists.

OADP-5552

Datamover pods scheduled on unexpected nodes during backup if the nodeAgent.loadAffinity parameter has many elements

Due to an issue in Velero 1.14 and later, the OADP node-agent only processes the first nodeSelector element within the loadAffinity array. As a consequence, if you define multiple nodeSelector objects, all objects except the first are ignored, potentially causing datamover pods to be scheduled on unexpected nodes during a backup.

To work around this problem, consolidate all required matchExpressions from multiple nodeSelector objects into the first nodeSelector object. As a result, all node affinity rules are correctly applied, ensuring datamover pods are scheduled to the appropriate nodes.

OADP-6469

OADP Backup fails when using CA certificates with aliased command

The CA certificate is not stored as a file on the running Velero container. As a consequence, the user experience degraded due to missing caCert in Velero container, requiring manual setup and downloads.
To work around this problem, manually add cert to the Velero deployment. For instructions, see Using cacert with velero command aliased via velero deployment.

OADP-4668

The nodeSelector spec is not supported for the Data Mover restore action

When a Data Protection Application (DPA) is created with the nodeSelector field set in the nodeAgent parameter, Data Mover restore partially fails instead of completing the restore operation. No known workaround exists.

OADP-4743

Image streams backups are partially failing when the DPA is configured with caCert

An unverified certificate in the S3 connection during backups with caCert in DataProtectionApplication (DPA) causes the ocp-django application&#8217;s backup to partially fail and result in data loss. No known workaround exists.

OADP-4817

Kopia does not delete cache on worker node

When the ephemeral-storage parameter is configured and running file system restore, the cache is not automatically deleted from the worker node. As a consequence, the /var partition overflows during backup restore, causing increased storage usage and potential resource exhaustion. To work around this problem, restart the node agent pod, which clears the cache. As a result, cache is deleted.

OADP-4855

GCP VSL backups fail with Workload Identity because of invalid project configuration

When performing a volumeSnapshotLocation (VSL) backup on GCP Workload Identity, the Velero GCP plugin creates an invalid API request if the GCP project is also specified in the snapshotLocations configuration of DataProtectionApplication (DPA). As a consequence, the GCP API returns a RESOURCE_PROJECT_INVALID error, and the backup job finishes with a PartiallyFailed status. No known workaround exists.

OADP-6697

VSL backups fail for CloudStorage API on AWS with STS

The volumeSnapshotLocation (VSL) backup fails because of missing the AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP parameter in the credentials file, even if AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP is already mentioned in the DataProtectionApplication (DPA) config for VSL. No known workaround exists.

OADP-6676

Backups of applications with ImageStreams fail on Azure with STS

When backing up applications that include image stream resources on an Azure cluster using STS, the OADP plugin incorrectly attempts to locate a secret-based credential for the container registry. As a consequence, the required secret is not found in the STS environment, causing the ImageStream custom backup action to fail. This results in the overall backup status marked as PartiallyFailed. No known workaround exists.

OADP-6675

DPA reconciliation fails for CloudStorageRef configuration

When a user creates a bucket and uses the backupLocations.bucket.cloudStorageRef configuration, bucket credentials are not present in the DataProtectionApplication (DPA) custom resource (CR). As a result, the DPA reconciliation fails even if bucket credentials are present in the CloudStorage CR. To work around this problem, add the same credentials to the backupLocations section of the DPA CR.

OADP-6669

## Deprecated features

The configuration.restic specification field has been deprecated

With OADP 1.5.0, the configuration.restic specification field has been deprecated. Use the nodeAgent section with the uploaderType field for selecting kopia or restic as a uploaderType. Note that Restic is deprecated in OADP 1.5.0.

OADP-5158

# OADP 1.5.0 release notes

The OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.5.0 release notes lists resolved issues and known issues.

## New features

OADP 1.5.0 introduces a new feature named OADP Self-Service, enabling namespace admin users to back up and restore applications on the {product-title}.
In the earlier versions of OADP, you needed the cluster-admin role to perform OADP operations such as backing up and restoring an application, creating a backup storage location, and so on.

From OADP 1.5.0 onward, you do not need the cluster-admin role to perform the backup and restore operations. You can use OADP with the namespace admin role. The namespace admin role has administrator access only to the namespace the user is assigned to.
You can use the Self-Service feature only after the cluster administrator installs the OADP Operator and provides the necessary permissions.

OADP-4001

You can collect logs, and information about OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) custom resources by using the must-gather tool. The must-gather data must be attached to all customer cases.
This tool generates a Markdown output file with the collected information, which is located in the must-gather logs clusters directory.

OADP-5384

The nodeAgent field in Data Protection Application (DPA) now includes the following parameters:

* dataMoverPrepareTimeout: Defines the duration the DataUpload or DataDownload process will wait. The default value is 30 minutes.
* resourceTimeout: Sets the timeout for resource processes not addressed by other specific timeout parameters. The default value is 10 minutes.

OADP-3736

Velero no longer uses the node-agent-config config map for configuring the nodeAgent daemon set. With this update, you must use the new spec.configuration.nodeAgent parameter in a Data Protection Application (DPA) for configuring the nodeAgent daemon set.

OADP-5042

With Velero 1.15 and later, you can now configure the total size of a cache per repository. This prevents pods from being removed due to running out of ephemeral storage. See the following new parameters added to the NodeAgentConfig field in DPA:

* cacheLimitMB: Sets the local data cache size limit in megabytes.
* fullMaintenanceInterval: The default value is 24 hours. Controls the removal rate of deleted Velero backups from the Kopia repository using the following override options:
* normalGC: 24 hours
* fastGC: 12 hours
* eagerGC: 6 hours

OADP-5900

With this update, the following changes are added:

* A new configuration option is now added to the velero field in DPA.
* The default value for the disableFsBackup parameter is false or non-existing. With this update, the following options are added to the SecurityContext field:
* Privileged: true
* AllowPrivilegeEscalation: true
* If you set the disableFsBackup parameter to true, it removes the following mounts from the node-agent:
* host-pods
* host-plugins
* Modifies that the node-agent is always run as a non-root user.
* Changes the root file system to read only.
* Updates the following mount points with the write access:
* /home/velero
* tmp/credentials
* Uses the SeccompProfileTypeRuntimeDefault option for the SeccompProfile parameter.

OADP-5031

By default, only one thread processes an item block. Velero 1.16 supports a parallel item backup, where multiple items within a backup can be processed in parallel.

You can use the optional Velero server parameter --item-block-worker-count to run additional worker threads to process items in parallel. To enable this in OADP, set the dpa.Spec.Configuration.Velero.ItemBlockWorkerCount parameter to an integer value greater than zero.


[NOTE]
----
Running multiple full backups in parallel is not yet supported.
----

OADP-5635

With the of release OADP 1.5.0, the logs are now available in the JSON format. It helps to have pre-parsed data in their Elastic logs management system.

OADP-3391

With this release, the oc get dpa command now displays RECONCILED status instead of displaying only NAME and AGE to improve user experience. For example:


```terminal
$ oc get dpa -n openshift-adp
NAME            RECONCILED   AGE
velero-sample   True         2m51s
```


OADP-1338

## Resolved issues

With this release, the terminationMessagePolicy field can now set the FallbackToLogsOnError value for the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Operator containers such as operator-manager, velero, node-agent, and non-admin-controller.

This change ensures that if a container exits with an error and the termination message file is empty, OpenShift uses the last portion of the container logs output as the termination message.

OADP-5183

Previously, the namespace admin could not execute an application after the restore operation with the following errors:

* exec operation is not allowed because the pod's security context exceeds your permissions
* unable to validate against any security context constraint
* not usable by user or serviceaccount, provider restricted-v2

With this update, this issue is now resolved and the namespace admin can access the application successfully after the restore.

OADP-5611

Previously, status restoration was only configured at the resource type using the restoreStatus field in the Restore custom resource (CR).

With this release, you can now specify the status restoration at the individual resource instance level using the following annotation:


```terminal
metadata:
  annotations:
    velero.io/restore-status: "true"
```


OADP-5968

Previously, on performing the backup of an application with the excludedClusterScopedResources field set to storageclasses, Namespace parameter, the backup was successful but the restore partially failed.
With this update, the restore is successful.

OADP-5239

Previously, a backup was marked as failed with the following error message:


```
failureReason: found a backup with status "InProgress" during the server starting,
mark it as "Failed"
```


With this update, the backup is completed if it gets restarted during the waitingForPluginOperations phase.

OADP-2941

Previously, when the spec.configuration.velero.disableFsBackup field from a Data Protection Application (DPA) was set to true, the backup partially failed with an error, which was not informative.

This update makes error messages more useful for troubleshooting issues. For example, error messages indicating that disableFsBackup: true is the issue in a DPA or not having access to a DPA if it is for non-administrator users.

OADP-5952

Previously, AWS credentials using STS authentication were not properly validated.

With this update, the parseAWSSecret function detects STS-specific fields, and updates the ensureSecretDataExists function to handle STS profiles correctly.

OADP-6105

Previously, the new configurations for repository maintenance job pod affinity was missing from a DPA specification.

With this update, the repositoryMaintenance job affinity config is now available to map a BackupRepository identifier to its configuration.

OADP-6134

Previously, when a schedule CR was created with a wrong spec.schedule value and the same was later patched with a correct value, the ValidationErrors field still existed. Consequently, the ValidationErrors field was displaying incorrect information even though the spec was correct.

With this update, the ValidationErrors field fades away once the CR specification is correct.

OADP-5419

Previously, when a restore operation was triggered with the includedNamespace field in a restore specification, restore operation was completed successfully but no volumeSnapshotContents custom resources (CR) were created and the PVCs were in a Pending status.

With this update, volumeSnapshotContents CR are restored even when the includedNamesapces field is used in restoreSpec. As a result, an application pod is in a Running state after restore.

OADP-5939

Previously, the container was configured with the readOnlyRootFilesystem: true setting for security, but the code attempted to create temporary files in the /tmp directory using the os.CreateTemp() function. Consequently, while using the AWS STS authentication with the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) flow, OADP failed to create temporary files that were required for AWS credential handling with the following error:


```terminal
ERROR unable to determine if bucket exists. {"error": "open /tmp/aws-shared-credentials1211864681: read-only file system"}
```


With this update, the following changes are added to address this issue:

* A new emptyDir volume named tmp-dir to the controller pod specification.
* A volume mount to the container, which mounts this volume to the /tmp directory.
* For security best practices, the readOnlyRootFilesystem: true is maintained.
* Replaced the deprecated ioutil.TempFile() function with the recommended os.CreateTemp() function.
* Removed the unnecessary io/ioutil import, which is no longer needed.

OADP-6019

For a complete list of all issues resolved in this release, see the list of OADP 1.5.0 resolved issues in Jira.

## Known issues

Even after deleting a backup, Kopia does not delete the volume artifacts from the ${bucket_name}/kopia/${namespace} on the S3 location after the backup expired. Information related to the expired and removed data files remains in the metadata.
To ensure that OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) functions properly, the data is not deleted, and it exists in the /kopia/ directory, for example:

* kopia.repository: Main repository format information such as encryption, version, and other details.
* kopia.blobcfg: Configuration for how data blobs are named.
* kopia.maintenance: Tracks maintenance owner, schedule, and last successful build.
* log: Log blobs.

OADP-5131

For a complete list of all known issues in this release, see the list of OADP 1.5.0 known issues in Jira.

## Deprecated features

With OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.5.0, the configuration.restic specification field has been deprecated. Use the nodeAgent section with the uploaderType field for selecting kopia or restic as a uploaderType. Note that, Restic is deprecated in OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.5.0.

OADP-5158

## Technology Preview

OADP can support and facilitate application migrations within HyperShift hosted OpenShift clusters as a Technology Preview. It ensures a seamless backup and restore operation for applications in hosted clusters.

For more information about the support scope of Red&#160;Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.

OADP-3930

# Upgrading OADP 1.4 to 1.5


[NOTE]
----
Always upgrade to the next minor version. Do not skip versions. To update to a later version, upgrade only one channel at a time. For example, to upgrade from OADP 1.1 to 1.3, upgrade first to 1.2, and then to 1.3.
----

## Changes from OADP 1.4 to 1.5

The Velero server has been updated from version 1.14 to 1.16.

This changes the following:

Version Support changes:: OpenShift API for Data Protection implements a streamlined version support policy. Red Hat supports only one version of OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) on one OpenShift version to ensure better stability and maintainability. OADP 1.5.0 is only supported on OpenShift 4.19 version.
OADP Self-Service:: OADP 1.5.0 introduces a new feature named OADP Self-Service, enabling namespace admin users to back up and restore applications on the {product-title}.
In the earlier versions of OADP, you needed the cluster-admin role to perform OADP operations such as backing up and restoring an application, creating a backup storage location, and so on.

From OADP 1.5.0 onward, you do not need the cluster-admin role to perform the backup and restore operations. You can use OADP with the namespace admin role. The namespace admin role has administrator access only to the namespace the user is assigned to.
You can use the Self-Service feature only after the cluster administrator installs the OADP Operator and provides the necessary permissions.
backupPVC and restorePVC configurations:: A backupPVC resource is an intermediate persistent volume claim (PVC) to access data during the data movement backup operation. You create a readonly backup PVC by using the nodeAgent.backupPVC section of the DataProtectionApplication (DPA) custom resource.

A restorePVC resource is an intermediate PVC that is used to write data during the Data Mover restore operation.

You can configure restorePVC in the DPA by using the ignoreDelayBinding field.

## Backing up the DPA configuration

You must back up your current DataProtectionApplication (DPA) configuration.

* Save your current DPA configuration by running the following command:
Example command

```terminal
$ oc get dpa -n openshift-adp -o yaml > dpa.orig.backup
```


## Upgrading the OADP Operator

You can upgrade the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Operator using the following procedure.


[NOTE]
----
Do not install OADP 1.5.0 on a OpenShift 4.18 cluster.
----

* You have installed the latest OADP 1.4.5.
* You have backed up your data.

1. Upgrade OpenShift 4.18 to OpenShift 4.19.

[NOTE]
----
OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.4 is not supported on OpenShift 4.19.
----
2. Change your subscription channel for the OADP Operator from stable-1.4 to stable.
3. Wait for the Operator and containers to update and restart.

## Converting DPA to the new version for OADP 1.5.0

The OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.4 is not supported on OpenShift 4.19. You can convert Data Protection Application (DPA) to the new OADP 1.5 version by using the new spec.configuration.nodeAgent field and its sub-fields.

1. To configure nodeAgent daemon set, use the spec.configuration.nodeAgent parameter in DPA. See the following example:
Example DataProtectionApplication configuration

```yaml
...
 spec:
   configuration:
     nodeAgent:
       enable: true
       uploaderType: kopia
...
```

2. To configure nodeAgent daemon set by using the ConfigMap resource named node-agent-config, see the following example configuration:
Example config map

```yaml
...
 spec:
   configuration:
     nodeAgent:
       backupPVC:
         ...
       loadConcurrency:
         ...
       podResources:
         ...
       restorePVC:
        ...
...
```


## Verifying the upgrade

You can verify the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) upgrade by using the following procedure.

1. Verify that the DataProtectionApplication (DPA) has been reconciled successfully:

```terminal
$ oc get dpa dpa-sample -n openshift-adp
```

Example output

```
NAME            RECONCILED   AGE
dpa-sample      True         2m51s
```


[NOTE]
----
The RECONCILED column must be True.
----
2. Verify that the installation finished by viewing the OADP resources by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get all -n openshift-adp
```

Example output

```

```


[NOTE]
----
The node-agent pods are created only while using restic or kopia in DataProtectionApplication (DPA).
In OADP 1.4.0 and OADP 1.3.0 version, the node-agent pods are labeled as restic.
----
3. Verify the backup storage location and confirm that the PHASE is Available by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get backupstoragelocations.velero.io -n openshift-adp
```

Example output
