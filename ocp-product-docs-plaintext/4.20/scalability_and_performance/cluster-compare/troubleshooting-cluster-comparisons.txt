# Troubleshooting cluster comparisons


When using the cluster-compare plugin, you might see unexpected results, such as false positives or conflicts when multiple cluster custom resources (CRs) exist.

# Troubleshooting false positives for missing resources

The plugin might report a missing resource even though the cluster custom resource (CR) is present in the cluster.

1. Ensure you are using the latest version of the cluster-compare plugin. For more information, see "Installing the cluster-compare plugin".
2. Ensure you are using the most up-to-date version of the reference configuration.
3. Ensure that template has the same apiVersion, kind, name, and namespace fields as the cluster CR.

# Troubleshooting multiple template matches for the same CR

In some cases, more than one cluster CR can match a template because they feature the same apiVersion, namespace, and kind. The plugin&#8217;s default matching compares the CR that features the least differences.

You can optionally configure your reference configuration to avoid this situation.

1. Ensure the templates feature distinct apiVersion, namespace, and kind values to ensure no duplicate template matching.
2. Use a user configuration file to manually match a template to a CR. For more information, see "Configuring manual matching between CRs and templates".
