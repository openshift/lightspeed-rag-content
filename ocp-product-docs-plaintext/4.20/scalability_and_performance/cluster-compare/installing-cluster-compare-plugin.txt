# Installing the cluster-compare plugin


You can extract the cluster-compare plugin from a container image in the Red Hat container catalog and use it as a plugin to the oc command.

# Installing the cluster-compare plugin

Install the cluster-compare plugin to compare a reference configuration with a cluster configuration from a live cluster or must-gather data.

1. You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
2. You installed podman.
3. You have access to the Red Hat container catalog.

1. Log in to the Red Hat container catalog by running the following command:

```terminal
$ podman login registry.redhat.io
```

2. Create a container for the cluster-compare image by running the following command:

```terminal
$ podman create --name cca registry.redhat.io/openshift4/kube-compare-artifacts-rhel9:latest
```

3. Copy the cluster-compare plugin to a directory that is included in your PATH environment variable by running the following command:

```terminal
$ podman cp cca:/usr/share/openshift/<arch>/kube-compare.<rhel_version> <directory_on_path>/kubectl-cluster_compare
```

* arch is the architecture for your machine. Valid values are:
* linux_amd64
* linux_arm64
* linux_ppc64le
* linux_s390x
* <rhel_version> is the version of RHEL on your machine. Valid values are rhel8 or rhel9.
* <directory_on_path> is the path to a directory included in your PATH environment variable.

* View the help for the plugin by running the following command:

```terminal
