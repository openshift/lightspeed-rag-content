# Scheduling NUMA-aware workloads


Learn about NUMA-aware scheduling and how you can use it to deploy high performance workloads in an {product-title} cluster.
The NUMA Resources Operator allows you to schedule high-performance workloads in the same NUMA zone. It deploys a node resources exporting agent that reports on available cluster node NUMA resources, and a secondary scheduler that manages the workloads.

# About NUMA

Non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architecture is a multiprocessor architecture model where CPUs do not access all memory in all locations at the same speed. Instead, CPUs can gain faster access to memory that is in closer proximity to them, or local to them, but slower access to memory that is further away.

A CPU with multiple memory controllers can use any available memory across CPU complexes, regardless of where the memory is located. However, this increased flexibility comes at the expense of performance.

NUMA resource topology refers to the physical locations of CPUs, memory, and PCI devices relative to each other in a NUMA zone. In a NUMA architecture, a NUMA zone is a group of CPUs that has its own processors and memory. Colocated resources are said to be in the same NUMA zone, and CPUs in a zone have faster access to the same local memory than CPUs outside of that zone.
A CPU processing a workload using memory that is outside its NUMA zone is slower than a workload processed in a single NUMA zone. For I/O-constrained workloads, the network interface on a distant NUMA zone slows down how quickly information can reach the application.

Applications can achieve better performance by containing data and processing within the same NUMA zone. For high-performance workloads and applications, such as telecommunications workloads, the cluster must process pod workloads in a single NUMA zone so that the workload can operate to specification.

# About NUMA-aware scheduling

NUMA-aware scheduling aligns the requested cluster compute resources (CPUs, memory, devices) in the same NUMA zone to process latency-sensitive or high-performance workloads efficiently. NUMA-aware scheduling also improves pod density per compute node for greater resource efficiency.

## Integration with Node Tuning Operator

By integrating the Node Tuning Operator&#8217;s performance profile with NUMA-aware scheduling, you can further configure CPU affinity to optimize performance for latency-sensitive workloads.

## Default scheduling logic

The default {product-title} pod scheduler scheduling logic considers the available resources of the entire compute node, not individual NUMA zones. If the most restrictive resource alignment is requested in the kubelet topology manager, error conditions can occur when admitting the pod to a node. Conversely, if the most restrictive resource alignment is not requested, the pod can be admitted to the node without proper resource alignment, leading to worse or unpredictable performance. For example, runaway pod creation with Topology Affinity Error statuses can occur when the pod scheduler makes suboptimal scheduling decisions for guaranteed pod workloads without knowing if the pod&#8217;s requested resources are available. Scheduling mismatch decisions can cause indefinite pod startup delays. Also, depending on the cluster state and resource allocation, poor pod scheduling decisions can cause extra load on the cluster because of failed startup attempts.

## NUMA-aware pod scheduling diagram

The NUMA Resources Operator deploys a custom NUMA resources secondary scheduler and other resources to mitigate against the shortcomings of the default {product-title} pod scheduler. The following diagram provides a high-level overview of NUMA-aware pod scheduling.

![Diagram of NUMA-aware scheduling that shows how the various components interact with each other in the cluster]

NodeResourceTopology API:: The NodeResourceTopology API describes the available NUMA zone resources in each compute node.
NUMA-aware scheduler:: The NUMA-aware secondary scheduler receives information about the available NUMA zones from the NodeResourceTopology API and schedules high-performance workloads on a node where it can be optimally processed.
Node topology exporter:: The node topology exporter exposes the available NUMA zone resources for each compute node to the NodeResourceTopology API. The node topology exporter daemon tracks the resource allocation from the kubelet by using the PodResources API.
PodResources API:: The PodResources API is local to each node and exposes the resource topology and available resources to the kubelet.

[NOTE]
----
The List endpoint of the PodResources API exposes exclusive CPUs allocated to a particular container. The API does not expose CPUs that belong to a shared pool.
The GetAllocatableResources endpoint exposes allocatable resources available on a node.

# NUMA resource scheduling strategies

When scheduling high-performance workloads, the secondary scheduler can employ different strategies to determine which NUMA node within a chosen worker node will handle the workload. The supported strategies in {product-title} include LeastAllocated, MostAllocated, and BalancedAllocation. Understanding these strategies helps optimize workload placement for performance and resource utilization.

When a high-performance workload is scheduled in a NUMA-aware cluster, the following steps occur:

1. The scheduler first selects a suitable worker node based on cluster-wide criteria. For example taints, labels, or resource availability.
2. After a worker node is selected, the scheduler evaluates its NUMA nodes and applies a scoring strategy to decide which NUMA node will handle the workload.
3. After a workload is scheduled, the selected NUMA node’s resources are updated to reflect the allocation.

The default strategy applied is the LeastAllocated strategy. This assigns workloads to the NUMA node with the most available resources that is the least utilized NUMA node. The goal of this strategy is to spread workloads across NUMA nodes to reduce contention and avoid hotspots.

The following table summarizes the different strategies and their outcomes:

## Scoring strategy summary



## LeastAllocated strategy example

The LeastAllocated is the default strategy. This strategy assigns workloads to the NUMA node with the most available resources, minimizing resource contention and spreading workloads across NUMA nodes. This reduces hotspots and ensures sufficient headroom for high-priority tasks. Assume a worker node has two NUMA nodes, and the workload requires 4 vCPUs and 8 GB of memory:



Because NUMA 2 has more available resources compared to NUMA 1, the workload is assigned to NUMA 2.

## MostAllocated strategy example

The MostAllocated strategy consolidates workloads by assigning them to the NUMA node with the least available resources, which is the most utilized NUMA node. This approach helps free other NUMA nodes for energy efficiency or critical workloads requiring full isolation. This example uses the "Example initial NUMA nodes state" values listed in the LeastAllocated section.

The workload again requires 4 vCPUs and 8 GB memory. NUMA 1 has fewer available resources compared to NUMA 2, so the scheduler assigns the workload to NUMA 1, further utilizing its resources while leaving NUMA 2 idle or minimally loaded.

## BalancedAllocation strategy example

The BalancedAllocation strategy assigns workloads to the NUMA node with the most balanced resource utilization across CPU and memory. The goal is to prevent imbalanced usage, such as high CPU utilization with underutilized memory. Assume a worker node has the following NUMA node states:



NUMA 1 has a more balanced CPU and memory utilization compared to NUMA 2 and therefore, with the BalancedAllocation strategy in place, the workload is assigned to NUMA 1.

```


1. Verify that the installation succeeded by inspecting the CSV resource in the openshift-numaresources namespace. Run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get csv -n openshift-numaresources
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                             DISPLAY                  VERSION   REPLACES   PHASE
numaresources-operator.v{product-version}.2   numaresources-operator   {product-version}.2               Succeeded
```


## Installing the NUMA Resources Operator using the web console

As a cluster administrator, you can install the NUMA Resources Operator using the web console.

1. Create a namespace for the NUMA Resources Operator:
1. In the {product-title} web console, click Administration -> Namespaces.
2. Click Create Namespace, enter openshift-numaresources in the Name field, and then click Create.
2. Install the NUMA Resources Operator:
1. In the {product-title} web console, click Operators -> OperatorHub.

3. Optional: Verify that the NUMA Resources Operator installed successfully:
1. Switch to the Operators -> Installed Operators page.
2. Ensure that NUMA Resources Operator is listed in the openshift-numaresources namespace with a Status of InstallSucceeded.

[NOTE]
----
During installation an Operator might display a Failed status. If the installation later succeeds with an InstallSucceeded message, you can ignore the Failed message.
----

If the Operator does not appear as installed, to troubleshoot further:
* Go to the Operators -> Installed Operators page and inspect the Operator Subscriptions and Install Plans tabs for any failure or errors under Status.
* Go to the Workloads -> Pods page and check the logs for pods in the default project.

# Configuring a single NUMA node policy

The NUMA Resources Operator requires a single NUMA node policy to be configured on the cluster. This can be achieved in two ways: by creating and applying a performance profile, or by configuring a KubeletConfig.


[NOTE]
----
The preferred way to configure a single NUMA node policy is to apply a performance profile. You can use the Performance Profile Creator (PPC) tool to create the performance profile. If a performance profile is created on the cluster, it automatically creates other tuning components like KubeletConfig and the tuned profile.
----

For more information about creating a performance profile, see "About the Performance Profile Creator" in the "Additional resources" section.

## Managing high availability (HA) for the NUMA-aware scheduler


[IMPORTANT]
----
Managing high availability is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
----

The NUMA Resources Operator manages the high availability of the NUMA-aware secondary scheduler based on the spec.replicas field in the NUMAResourcesScheduler custom resource (CR). By default, the NUMA Resources Operator automatically enables HA mode by creating one scheduler replica for each control plane node, with a maximum of three replicas.

The following manifest demonstrates this default behavior. To automatically enable replica detection, omit the replicas field.


```yaml
apiVersion: nodetopology.openshift.io/v1
kind: NUMAResourcesScheduler
metadata:
  name: example-auto-ha
spec:
  imageSpec: 'registry.redhat.io/openshift4/noderesourcetopology-scheduler-rhel9:v{product-version}'
  # The 'replicas' field is not included, enabling auto-detection.
```


You can control scheduler behavior by using one of the following options:

* Customizing the number of replicas.
* Disabling NUMA-aware scheduling.

### Customizing scheduler replicas

Set a specific number of scheduler replicas by updating the spec.replicas field in the NUMAResourcesScheduler custom resource. This overrides the default HA behavior.

1. Create the NUMAResourcesScheduler CR with the following YAML named for example custom-ha.yaml that sets the number of replicas to 2:

```yaml
apiVersion: nodetopology.openshift.io/v1
kind: NUMAResourcesScheduler
metadata:
  name: example-custom
spec:
  imageSpec: 'registry.redhat.io/openshift4/noderesourcetopology-scheduler-rhel9:v{product-version}'
  replicas: 2
```

2. Deploy the NUMA-aware pod scheduler by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f custom-ha.yaml
```


### Disabling NUMA-aware scheduling

Disable the NUMA-aware scheduler, stopping all running scheduler pods and preventing new ones from starting.

1. Save the following minimal required YAML in the nro-disable-scheduler.yaml file. Disable the scheduler by setting the spec.replicas field to 0.

```yaml
apiVersion: nodetopology.openshift.io/v1
kind: NUMAResourcesScheduler
metadata:
  name: example-disable
spec:
  imageSpec: 'registry.redhat.io/openshift4/noderesourcetopology-scheduler-rhel9:v{product-version}'
  replicas: 0
```

2. Disable the NUMA-aware pod scheduler by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f nro-disable-scheduler.yaml
```


### Verifying scheduler high availability (HA) status

Verify the status of the NUMA-aware scheduler to ensure it is running with the expected number of replicas based on your configuration.

1. List only the scheduler pods by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get pods -n openshift-numaresources -l app=secondary-scheduler
```

Expected output

Using the default HA mode, the number of pods equals the number of control-plane nodes. A standard HA {product-title} cluster typically has three control-plane nodes, and therefore displays three pods:

```terminal
NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
secondary-scheduler-5b8c9d479d-2r4p5   1/1     Running   0          5m
secondary-scheduler-5b8c9d479d-k2f3p   1/1     Running   0          5m
secondary-scheduler-5b8c9d479d-q8c7b   1/1     Running   0          5m
```

* If you customized the replicas, the number of pods matches the value you set.
* If you disabled the scheduler, there are no running pods with this label.

[NOTE]
----
A limit of 3 replicas is enforced for the NUMA-aware scheduler. On a hosted control planes cluster, the scheduler pods run on the worker nodes of the hosted-cluster.
----
2. Verify the number of replicas and their status by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get deployment secondary-scheduler -n openshift-numaresources
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                  READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
secondary-scheduler   3/3     3            3           5m
```


In this output, 3/3 means 3 replicas are ready out of an expected 3 replicas.
3. For more detailed information run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc describe deployment secondary-scheduler -n openshift-numaresources
```

Example output

The Replicas line shows a deployment configured for 3 replicas, with all 3 updated and available.

```yaml
Replicas:        3 desired | 3 updated | 3 total | 3 available | 0 unavailable
```


* Configuring image registry repository mirroring
* About the Performance Profile Creator

## Sample performance profile

This example YAML shows a performance profile created by using the performance profile creator (PPC) tool:


```yaml
apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2
kind: PerformanceProfile
metadata:
  name: performance
spec:
  cpu:
    isolated: "3"
    reserved: 0-2
  machineConfigPoolSelector:
    pools.operator.machineconfiguration.openshift.io/worker: "" 1
  nodeSelector:
    node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ""
  numa:
    topologyPolicy: single-numa-node 2
  realTimeKernel:
    enabled: true
  workloadHints:
    highPowerConsumption: true
    perPodPowerManagement: false
    realTime: true
```


This value must match the MachineConfigPool value that you want to configure the NUMA Resources Operator on. For example, you might create a MachineConfigPool object named worker-cnf that designates a set of nodes that run telecommunications workloads. The value for MachineConfigPool must match the machineConfigPoolSelector value in the NUMAResourcesOperator CR that you configure later in "Creating the NUMAResourcesOperator custom resource".
Ensure that the topologyPolicy field is set to single-numa-node by setting the topology-manager-policy argument to single-numa-node when you run the PPC tool.

[NOTE]
----
For hosted control plane clusters, the machineConfigPoolSelector does not have any functional effect. Node association is instead determined by the specified NodePool object.
----

## Creating a KubeletConfig CR

The recommended way to configure a single NUMA node policy is to apply a performance profile. Another way is by creating and applying a KubeletConfig custom resource (CR), as shown in the following procedure.

1. Create the KubeletConfig custom resource (CR) that configures the pod admittance policy for the machine profile:
1. Save the following YAML in the nro-kubeletconfig.yaml file:

```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: KubeletConfig
metadata:
  name: worker-tuning
spec:
  machineConfigPoolSelector:
    matchLabels:
      pools.operator.machineconfiguration.openshift.io/worker: "" 1
  kubeletConfig:
    cpuManagerPolicy: "static" 2
    cpuManagerReconcilePeriod: "5s"
    reservedSystemCPUs: "0,1" 3
    memoryManagerPolicy: "Static" 4
    evictionHard:
      memory.available: "100Mi"
    kubeReserved:
      memory: "512Mi"
    reservedMemory:
      - numaNode: 0
        limits:
          memory: "1124Mi"
    systemReserved:
      memory: "512Mi"
    topologyManagerPolicy: "single-numa-node" 5
```

Ensure that this label matches the machineConfigPoolSelector setting in the NUMAResourcesOperator CR that you configure later in "Creating the NUMAResourcesOperator custom resource".
For cpuManagerPolicy, static must use a lowercase s.
Adjust this based on the CPU on your nodes.
For memoryManagerPolicy, Static must use an uppercase S.
topologyManagerPolicy must be set to single-numa-node.

[NOTE]
----
For hosted control plane clusters, the machineConfigPoolSelector setting does not have any functional effect. Node association is instead determined by the specified NodePool object. To apply a KubeletConfig for hosted control plane clusters, you must create a ConfigMap that contains the configuration, and then reference that ConfigMap within the spec.config field of a NodePool.
----
2. Create the KubeletConfig CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f nro-kubeletconfig.yaml
```


[NOTE]
----
Applying performance profile or KubeletConfig automatically triggers rebooting of the nodes. If no reboot is triggered, you can troubleshoot the issue by looking at the labels in KubeletConfig that address the node group.
----

# Scheduling NUMA-aware workloads

Clusters running latency-sensitive workloads typically feature performance profiles that help to minimize workload latency and optimize performance. The NUMA-aware scheduler deploys workloads based on available node NUMA resources and with respect to any performance profile settings applied to the node. The combination of NUMA-aware deployments, and the performance profile of the workload, ensures that workloads are scheduled in a way that maximizes performance.

For the NUMA Resources Operator to be fully operational, you must deploy the NUMAResourcesOperator custom resource and the NUMA-aware secondary pod scheduler.

## Creating the NUMAResourcesOperator custom resource

When you have installed the NUMA Resources Operator, then create the NUMAResourcesOperator custom resource (CR) that instructs the NUMA Resources Operator to install all the cluster infrastructure needed to support the NUMA-aware scheduler, including daemon sets and APIs.

* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* Install the NUMA Resources Operator.

1. Create the NUMAResourcesOperator custom resource:
1. Save the following minimal required YAML file example as nrop.yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: nodetopology.openshift.io/v1
kind: NUMAResourcesOperator
metadata:
  name: numaresourcesoperator
spec:
  nodeGroups:
  - machineConfigPoolSelector:
      matchLabels:
        pools.operator.machineconfiguration.openshift.io/worker: "" 1
```

This must match the MachineConfigPool resource that you want to configure the NUMA Resources Operator on. For example, you might have created a MachineConfigPool resource named worker-cnf that designates a set of nodes expected to run telecommunications workloads. Each NodeGroup must match exactly one MachineConfigPool. Configurations where NodeGroup matches more than one MachineConfigPool are not supported.
2. Create the NUMAResourcesOperator CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f nrop.yaml
```

2. Optional: To enable NUMA-aware scheduling for multiple machine config pools (MCPs), define a separate NodeGroup for each pool. For example, define three NodeGroups for worker-cnf, worker-ht, and worker-other, in the NUMAResourcesOperator CR as shown in the following example:
Example YAML definition for a NUMAResourcesOperator CR with multiple NodeGroups

```yaml
apiVersion: nodetopology.openshift.io/v1
kind: NUMAResourcesOperator
metadata:
  name: numaresourcesoperator
spec:
  logLevel: Normal
  nodeGroups:
    - machineConfigPoolSelector:
        matchLabels:
          machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker-ht
    - machineConfigPoolSelector:
        matchLabels:
          machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker-cnf
    - machineConfigPoolSelector:
        matchLabels:
          machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker-other
```


1. Verify that the NUMA Resources Operator deployed successfully by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get numaresourcesoperators.nodetopology.openshift.io
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                    AGE
numaresourcesoperator   27s
```

2. After a few minutes, run the following command to verify that the required resources deployed successfully:

```terminal
$ oc get all -n openshift-numaresources
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/numaresources-controller-manager-7d9d84c58d-qk2mr   1/1     Running   0          12m
pod/numaresourcesoperator-worker-7d96r                  2/2     Running   0          97s
pod/numaresourcesoperator-worker-crsht                  2/2     Running   0          97s
pod/numaresourcesoperator-worker-jp9mw                  2/2     Running   0          97s
```


## Creating the NUMAResourcesOperator custom resource for hosted control planes

After you install the NUMA Resources Operator, create the NUMAResourcesOperator custom resource (CR). The CR instructs the NUMA Resources Operator to install all the cluster infrastructure that is needed to support the NUMA-aware scheduler on hosted control planes, including daemon sets and APIs.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Creating the NUMAResourcesOperator custom resource for hosted control planes is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

* Install the NUMA Resources Operator.

1. Export the management cluster kubeconfig file by running the following command:

```terminal
$ export KUBECONFIG=<path-to-management-cluster-kubeconfig>
```

2. Find the node-pool-name for your cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc --kubeconfig="$MGMT_KUBECONFIG" get np -A
```

Example output

```terminal
NAMESPACE   NAME                     CLUSTER       DESIRED NODES   CURRENT NODES   AUTOSCALING   AUTOREPAIR   VERSION   UPDATINGVERSION   UPDATINGCONFIG   MESSAGE

metadata:
  name: numaresourcesoperator
spec:
  nodeGroups:
  - poolName: democluster-us-east-1a 1
```

The poolName is the node-pool-name retrieved in step 2.
4. On the management cluster, run the following command to list the available secrets:

```terminal
$ oc get secrets -n clusters
```

Example output

```terminal

deployer-dockercfg-8lfpd          kubernetes.io/dockercfg   1      128m
```

5. Extract the kubeconfig file for the hosted cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get secret <SECRET_NAME> -n clusters -o jsonpath='{.data.kubeconfig}' | base64 -d > hosted-cluster-kubeconfig
```

Example

```terminal
$ oc get secret democluster-admin-kubeconfig -n clusters -o jsonpath='{.data.kubeconfig}' | base64 -d > hosted-cluster-kubeconfig
```

6. Export the hosted cluster kubeconfig file by running the following command:

```terminal
$ export HC_KUBECONFIG=<path_to_hosted-cluster-kubeconfig>
```

7. Create the NUMAResourcesOperator CR by running the following command on the hosted cluster:

```terminal
$ oc create -f nrop-hcp.yaml
```


1. Verify that the NUMA Resources Operator deployed successfully by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get numaresourcesoperators.nodetopology.openshift.io
```

Example output

```terminal

numaresourcesoperator   27s
```

2. After a few minutes, run the following command to verify that the required resources deployed successfully:

```terminal
$ oc get all -n openshift-numaresources
```

Example output

```terminal

* Creating a performance profile for hosted control planes

## Deploying the NUMA-aware secondary pod scheduler

After you install the NUMA Resources Operator, follow this procedure to deploy the NUMA-aware secondary pod scheduler.

1. Create the NUMAResourcesScheduler custom resource that deploys the NUMA-aware custom pod scheduler:
1. Save the following minimal required YAML in the nro-scheduler.yaml file:

```yaml
apiVersion: nodetopology.openshift.io/v1
kind: NUMAResourcesScheduler
metadata:
  name: numaresourcesscheduler
spec:
  imageSpec: "registry.redhat.io/openshift4/noderesourcetopology-scheduler-rhel9:v{product-version}" 1
```

In a disconnected environment, make sure to configure the resolution of this image by either:
* Creating an ImageTagMirrorSet custom resource (CR). For more information, see "Configuring image registry repository mirroring" in the "Additional resources" section.
* Setting the URL to the disconnected registry.
2. Create the NUMAResourcesScheduler CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f nro-scheduler.yaml
```


[NOTE]
----
In a hosted control plane cluster, run this command on the hosted control plane node.
----
2. After a few seconds, run the following command to confirm the successful deployment of the required resources:

```terminal
$ oc get all -n openshift-numaresources
```

Example output

```terminal

```


## Scheduling workloads with the NUMA-aware scheduler

Now that topo-aware-scheduler is installed, the NUMAResourcesOperator and NUMAResourcesScheduler CRs are applied and your cluster has a matching performance profile or kubeletconfig, you can schedule workloads with the NUMA-aware scheduler using deployment CRs that specify the minimum required resources to process the workload.

The following example deployment uses NUMA-aware scheduling for a sample workload.

* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

1. Get the name of the NUMA-aware scheduler that is deployed in the cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get numaresourcesschedulers.nodetopology.openshift.io numaresourcesscheduler -o json | jq '.status.schedulerName'
```

Example output

```terminal
"topo-aware-scheduler"
```

2. Create a Deployment CR that uses scheduler named topo-aware-scheduler, for example:
1. Save the following YAML in the nro-deployment.yaml file:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: numa-deployment-1
  namespace: openshift-numaresources
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: test
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: test
    spec:
      schedulerName: topo-aware-scheduler 1
      containers:
      - name: ctnr
        image: quay.io/openshifttest/hello-openshift:openshift
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: "100Mi"
            cpu: "10"
          requests:
            memory: "100Mi"
            cpu: "10"
      - name: ctnr2
        image: registry.access.redhat.com/rhel:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args: [ "while true; do sleep 1h; done;" ]
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: "100Mi"
            cpu: "8"
          requests:
            memory: "100Mi"
            cpu: "8"
```

schedulerName must match the name of the NUMA-aware scheduler that is deployed in your cluster, for example topo-aware-scheduler.
2. Create the Deployment CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f nro-deployment.yaml
```


1. Verify that the deployment was successful:

```terminal
$ oc get pods -n openshift-numaresources
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

numaresources-controller-manager-7d9d84c58d-4v65j   1/1     Running   0          18m
numaresourcesoperator-worker-7d96r                  2/2     Running   4          43m
numaresourcesoperator-worker-crsht                  2/2     Running   2          43m
numaresourcesoperator-worker-jp9mw                  2/2     Running   2          43m
secondary-scheduler-847cb74f84-fpncj                1/1     Running   0          18m
```

2. Verify that the topo-aware-scheduler is scheduling the deployed pod by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc describe pod numa-deployment-1-6c4f5bdb84-wgn6g -n openshift-numaresources
```

Example output

```terminal
Events:
  Type    Reason          Age    From                  Message
  ----    ------          ----   ----                  -------
  Normal  Scheduled       4m45s  topo-aware-scheduler  Successfully assigned openshift-numaresources/numa-deployment-1-6c4f5bdb84-wgn6g to worker-1
```


[NOTE]
----
Deployments that request more resources than is available for scheduling will fail with a MinimumReplicasUnavailable error. The deployment succeeds when the required resources become available. Pods remain in the Pending state until the required resources are available.
----
3. Verify that the expected allocated resources are listed for the node.
1. Identify the node that is running the deployment pod by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get pods -n openshift-numaresources -o wide
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP            NODE     NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
numa-deployment-1-6c4f5bdb84-wgn6g   0/2     Running   0          82m   10.128.2.50   worker-1   <none>  <none>
```

2. Run the following command with the name of that node that is running the deployment pod.

```terminal
$ oc describe noderesourcetopologies.topology.node.k8s.io worker-1
```

Example output

```terminal
...

Zones:
  Costs:
    Name:   node-0
    Value:  10
    Name:   node-1
    Value:  21
  Name:     node-0
  Resources:
    Allocatable:  39
    Available:    21 1
    Capacity:     40
    Name:         cpu
    Allocatable:  6442450944
    Available:    6442450944
    Capacity:     6442450944
    Name:         hugepages-1Gi
    Allocatable:  134217728
    Available:    134217728
    Capacity:     134217728
    Name:         hugepages-2Mi
    Allocatable:  262415904768
    Available:    262206189568
    Capacity:     270146007040
    Name:         memory
  Type:           Node
```

The Available capacity is reduced because of the resources that have been allocated to the guaranteed pod.

Resources consumed by guaranteed pods are subtracted from the available node resources listed under noderesourcetopologies.topology.node.k8s.io.
4. Resource allocations for pods with a Best-effort or Burstable quality of service (qosClass) are not reflected in the NUMA node resources under noderesourcetopologies.topology.node.k8s.io. If a pod's consumed resources are not reflected in the node resource calculation, verify that the pod has qosClass of Guaranteed and the CPU request is an integer value, not a decimal value. You can verify the that the pod has a  qosClass of Guaranteed by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get pod numa-deployment-1-6c4f5bdb84-wgn6g -n openshift-numaresources -o jsonpath="{ .status.qosClass }"
```

Example output

```terminal
Guaranteed
```


# Optional: Configuring polling operations for NUMA resources updates

The daemons controlled by the NUMA Resources Operator in their nodeGroup poll resources to retrieve updates about available NUMA resources. You can fine-tune polling operations for these daemons by configuring the spec.nodeGroups specification in the NUMAResourcesOperator custom resource (CR). This provides advanced control of polling operations. Configure these specifications to improve scheduling behavior and troubleshoot suboptimal scheduling decisions.

The configuration options are the following:

* infoRefreshMode: Determines the trigger condition for polling the kubelet. The NUMA Resources Operator reports the resulting information to the API server.
* infoRefreshPeriod: Determines the duration between polling updates.
* podsFingerprinting: Determines if point-in-time information for the current set of pods running on a node is exposed in polling updates.

[NOTE]
----
The default value for podsFingerprinting is EnabledExclusiveResources. To optimize scheduler performance, set podsFingerprinting to either EnabledExclusiveResources or Enabled. Additionally, configure the cacheResyncPeriod in the NUMAResourcesScheduler custom resource (CR) to a value greater than 0. The cacheResyncPeriod specification helps to report more exact resource availability by monitoring pending resources on nodes.
----

* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* Install the NUMA Resources Operator.

* Configure the spec.nodeGroups specification in your NUMAResourcesOperator CR:

```yaml
apiVersion: nodetopology.openshift.io/v1
kind: NUMAResourcesOperator
metadata:
  name: numaresourcesoperator
spec:
  nodeGroups:
  - config:
      infoRefreshMode: Periodic 1
      infoRefreshPeriod: 10s 2
      podsFingerprinting: Enabled 3
    name: worker
```

Valid values are Periodic, Events, PeriodicAndEvents. Use Periodic to poll the kubelet at intervals that you define in infoRefreshPeriod. Use Events to poll the kubelet at every pod lifecycle event. Use PeriodicAndEvents to enable both methods.
Define the polling interval for Periodic or PeriodicAndEvents refresh modes. The field is ignored if the refresh mode is Events.
Valid values are Enabled, Disabled, and EnabledExclusiveResources. Setting to Enabled or EnabledExclusiveResources is a requirement for the cacheResyncPeriod specification in the NUMAResourcesScheduler.

1. After you deploy the NUMA Resources Operator, verify that the node group configurations were applied by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get numaresop numaresourcesoperator -o json | jq '.status'
```

Example output

```terminal
      ...

        "config": {
        "infoRefreshMode": "Periodic",
        "infoRefreshPeriod": "10s",
        "podsFingerprinting": "Enabled"
      },
      "name": "worker"

      ...
```


# Troubleshooting NUMA-aware scheduling

To troubleshoot common problems with NUMA-aware pod scheduling, perform the following steps.

* Install the {product-title} CLI (oc).
* Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* Install the NUMA Resources Operator and deploy the NUMA-aware secondary scheduler.

1. Verify that the noderesourcetopologies CRD is deployed in the cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get crd | grep noderesourcetopologies
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                                                              CREATED AT
noderesourcetopologies.topology.node.k8s.io                       2022-01-18T08:28:06Z
```

2. Check that the NUMA-aware scheduler name matches the name specified in your NUMA-aware workloads by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get numaresourcesschedulers.nodetopology.openshift.io numaresourcesscheduler -o json | jq '.status.schedulerName'
```

Example output

```terminal
topo-aware-scheduler
```

3. Verify that NUMA-aware schedulable nodes have the noderesourcetopologies CR applied to them. Run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get noderesourcetopologies.topology.node.k8s.io
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                    AGE
compute-0.example.com   17h
compute-1.example.com   17h
```


[NOTE]
----
The number of nodes should equal the number of worker nodes that are configured by the machine config pool (mcp) worker definition.
----
4. Verify the NUMA zone granularity for all schedulable nodes by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get noderesourcetopologies.topology.node.k8s.io -o yaml
```

Example output

```yaml

Each stanza under zones describes the resources for a single NUMA zone.
resources describes the current state of the NUMA zone resources. Check that resources listed under items.zones.resources.available correspond to the exclusive NUMA zone resources allocated to each guaranteed pod.

## Reporting more exact resource availability

Enable the cacheResyncPeriod specification to help the NUMA Resources Operator report more exact resource availability by monitoring pending resources on nodes and synchronizing this information in the scheduler cache at a defined interval. This also helps to minimize Topology Affinity Error errors because of sub-optimal scheduling decisions. The lower the interval, the greater the network load. The cacheResyncPeriod specification is disabled by default.

* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

1. Delete the currently running NUMAResourcesScheduler resource:
1. Get the active NUMAResourcesScheduler by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get NUMAResourcesScheduler
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                     AGE
numaresourcesscheduler   92m
```

2. Delete the secondary scheduler resource by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete NUMAResourcesScheduler numaresourcesscheduler
```

Example output

```terminal
numaresourcesscheduler.nodetopology.openshift.io "numaresourcesscheduler" deleted
```

2. Save the following YAML in the file nro-scheduler-cacheresync.yaml. This example changes the log level to Debug:

```yaml
apiVersion: nodetopology.openshift.io/v1
kind: NUMAResourcesScheduler
metadata:
  name: numaresourcesscheduler
spec:
  imageSpec: "registry.redhat.io/openshift4/noderesourcetopology-scheduler-container-rhel8:v{product-version}"
  cacheResyncPeriod: "5s" 1
```

Enter an interval value in seconds for synchronization of the scheduler cache. A value of 5s is typical for most implementations.
3. Create the updated NUMAResourcesScheduler resource by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f nro-scheduler-cacheresync.yaml
```

Example output

```terminal
numaresourcesscheduler.nodetopology.openshift.io/numaresourcesscheduler created
```


1. Check that the NUMA-aware scheduler was successfully deployed:
1. Run the following command to check that the CRD is created successfully:

```terminal
$ oc get crd | grep numaresourcesschedulers
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                                                              CREATED AT
numaresourcesschedulers.nodetopology.openshift.io                 2022-02-25T11:57:03Z
```

2. Check that the new custom scheduler is available by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get numaresourcesschedulers.nodetopology.openshift.io
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                     AGE
numaresourcesscheduler   3h26m
```

2. Check that the logs for the scheduler show the increased log level:
1. Get the list of pods running in the openshift-numaresources namespace by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get pods -n openshift-numaresources
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

## Changing where high-performance workloads run

The NUMA-aware secondary scheduler is responsible for scheduling high-performance workloads on a worker node and within a NUMA node where the workloads can be optimally processed. By default, the secondary scheduler assigns workloads to the NUMA node within the chosen worker node that has the most available resources.

If you want to change where the workloads run, you can add the scoringStrategy setting to the NUMAResourcesScheduler custom resource and set its value to either MostAllocated  or BalancedAllocation.

* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

1. Delete the currently running NUMAResourcesScheduler resource by using the following steps:
1. Get the active NUMAResourcesScheduler by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get NUMAResourcesScheduler
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                     AGE
numaresourcesscheduler   92m
```

2. Delete the secondary scheduler resource by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete NUMAResourcesScheduler numaresourcesscheduler
```

Example output

```terminal
numaresourcesscheduler.nodetopology.openshift.io "numaresourcesscheduler" deleted
```

2. Save the following YAML in the file nro-scheduler-mostallocated.yaml. This example changes the scoringStrategy to MostAllocated:

```yaml
apiVersion: nodetopology.openshift.io/v1
kind: NUMAResourcesScheduler
metadata:
  name: numaresourcesscheduler
spec:
  imageSpec: "registry.redhat.io/openshift4/noderesourcetopology-scheduler-container-rhel8:v{product-version}"
  scoringStrategy:
        type: "MostAllocated" 1
```

If the scoringStrategy configuration is omitted, the default of LeastAllocated applies.
3. Create the updated NUMAResourcesScheduler resource by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f nro-scheduler-mostallocated.yaml
```

Example output

```terminal
numaresourcesscheduler.nodetopology.openshift.io/numaresourcesscheduler created
```


1. Check that the NUMA-aware scheduler was successfully deployed by using the following steps:
1. Run the following command to check that the custom resource definition (CRD) is created successfully:

```terminal
$ oc get crd | grep numaresourcesschedulers
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                                                              CREATED AT
numaresourcesschedulers.nodetopology.openshift.io                 2022-02-25T11:57:03Z
```

2. Check that the new custom scheduler is available by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get numaresourcesschedulers.nodetopology.openshift.io
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                     AGE
numaresourcesscheduler   3h26m
```

2. Verify that the ScoringStrategy has been applied correctly by running the following command to check the relevant ConfigMap resource for the scheduler:

```terminal
$ oc get -n openshift-numaresources cm topo-aware-scheduler-config -o yaml | grep scoring -A 1
```

Example output

```terminal
scoringStrategy:
  type: MostAllocated
```


## Checking the NUMA-aware scheduler logs

Troubleshoot problems with the NUMA-aware scheduler by reviewing the logs. If required, you can increase the scheduler log level by modifying the spec.logLevel field of the NUMAResourcesScheduler resource. Acceptable values are Normal, Debug, and Trace, with Trace being the most verbose option.


[NOTE]
----
To change the log level of the secondary scheduler, delete the running scheduler resource and re-deploy it with the changed log level. The scheduler is unavailable for scheduling new workloads during this downtime.
----

* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

1. Delete the currently running NUMAResourcesScheduler resource:
1. Get the active NUMAResourcesScheduler by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get NUMAResourcesScheduler
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                     AGE
numaresourcesscheduler   90m
```

2. Delete the secondary scheduler resource by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete NUMAResourcesScheduler numaresourcesscheduler
```

Example output

```terminal
numaresourcesscheduler.nodetopology.openshift.io "numaresourcesscheduler" deleted
```

2. Save the following YAML in the file nro-scheduler-debug.yaml. This example changes the log level to Debug:

```yaml
apiVersion: nodetopology.openshift.io/v1
kind: NUMAResourcesScheduler
metadata:
  name: numaresourcesscheduler
spec:
  imageSpec: "registry.redhat.io/openshift4/noderesourcetopology-scheduler-container-rhel8:v{product-version}"
  logLevel: Debug
```

3. Create the updated Debug logging NUMAResourcesScheduler resource by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f nro-scheduler-debug.yaml
```

Example output

```terminal
numaresourcesscheduler.nodetopology.openshift.io/numaresourcesscheduler created
```


1. Check that the NUMA-aware scheduler was successfully deployed:
1. Run the following command to check that the CRD is created successfully:

```terminal
$ oc get crd | grep numaresourcesschedulers
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                                                              CREATED AT
numaresourcesschedulers.nodetopology.openshift.io                 2022-02-25T11:57:03Z
```

2. Check that the new custom scheduler is available by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get numaresourcesschedulers.nodetopology.openshift.io
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                     AGE
numaresourcesscheduler   3h26m
```

2. Check that the logs for the scheduler shows the increased log level:
1. Get the list of pods running in the openshift-numaresources namespace by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get pods -n openshift-numaresources
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
numaresources-controller-manager-d87d79587-76mrm   1/1     Running   0          46h

secondary-scheduler-7976c4d466-qm4sc               1/1     Running   0          21m
```

2. Get the logs for the secondary scheduler pod by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc logs secondary-scheduler-7976c4d466-qm4sc -n openshift-numaresources
```

Example output

```terminal

## Troubleshooting the resource topology exporter

Troubleshoot noderesourcetopologies objects where unexpected results are occurring by inspecting the corresponding resource-topology-exporter logs.


[NOTE]
----
It is recommended that NUMA resource topology exporter instances in the cluster are named for nodes they refer to. For example, a worker node with the name worker should have a corresponding noderesourcetopologies object called worker.
----

* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

1. Get the daemonsets managed by the NUMA Resources Operator. Each daemonset has a corresponding nodeGroup in the NUMAResourcesOperator CR. Run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get numaresourcesoperators.nodetopology.openshift.io numaresourcesoperator -o jsonpath="{.status.daemonsets[0]}"
```

Example output

```json
{"name":"numaresourcesoperator-worker","namespace":"openshift-numaresources"}
```

2. Get the label for the daemonset of interest using the value for name from the previous step:

```terminal
$ oc get ds -n openshift-numaresources numaresourcesoperator-worker -o jsonpath="{.spec.selector.matchLabels}"
```

Example output

```json
{"name":"resource-topology"}
```

3. Get the pods using the resource-topology label by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get pods -n openshift-numaresources -l name=resource-topology -o wide
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE    IP            NODE
numaresourcesoperator-worker-5wm2k   2/2     Running   0          2d1h   10.135.0.64   compute-0.example.com
numaresourcesoperator-worker-pb75c   2/2     Running   0          2d1h   10.132.2.33   compute-1.example.com
```

4. Examine the logs of the resource-topology-exporter container running on the worker pod that corresponds to the node you are troubleshooting. Run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc logs -n openshift-numaresources -c resource-topology-exporter numaresourcesoperator-worker-pb75c
```

Example output

```terminal
I0221 13:38:18.334140       1 main.go:206] using sysinfo:
reservedCpus: 0,1
reservedMemory:

## Correcting a missing resource topology exporter config map

If you install the NUMA Resources Operator in a cluster with misconfigured cluster settings, in some circumstances, the Operator is shown as active but the logs of the resource topology exporter (RTE) daemon set pods show that the configuration for the RTE is missing, for example:


```text
Info: couldn't find configuration in "/etc/resource-topology-exporter/config.yaml"
```


This log message indicates that the kubeletconfig with the required configuration was not properly applied in the cluster, resulting in a missing RTE configmap. For example, the following cluster is missing a numaresourcesoperator-worker configmap custom resource (CR):


```terminal
$ oc get configmap
```



```terminal
NAME                           DATA   AGE
0e2a6bd3.openshift-kni.io      0      6d21h
kube-root-ca.crt               1      6d21h
openshift-service-ca.crt       1      6d21h
topo-aware-scheduler-config    1      6d18h
```


In a correctly configured cluster, oc get configmap also returns a numaresourcesoperator-worker configmap CR.

* Install the {product-title} CLI (oc).
* Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* Install the NUMA Resources Operator and deploy the NUMA-aware secondary scheduler.

1. Compare the values for spec.machineConfigPoolSelector.matchLabels in kubeletconfig and
metadata.labels in the MachineConfigPool (mcp) worker CR using the following commands:
1. Check the kubeletconfig labels by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get kubeletconfig -o yaml
```

Example output

```yaml
machineConfigPoolSelector:
  matchLabels:
    cnf-worker-tuning: enabled
```

2. Check the mcp labels by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get mcp worker -o yaml
```

Example output

```yaml
labels:
  machineconfiguration.openshift.io/mco-built-in: ""
  pools.operator.machineconfiguration.openshift.io/worker: ""
```


The cnf-worker-tuning: enabled label is not present in the MachineConfigPool object.
2. Edit the MachineConfigPool CR to include the missing label, for example:

```terminal
$ oc edit mcp worker -o yaml
```

Example output

```yaml
labels:
  machineconfiguration.openshift.io/mco-built-in: ""
  pools.operator.machineconfiguration.openshift.io/worker: ""
  cnf-worker-tuning: enabled
```

3. Apply the label changes and wait for the cluster to apply the updated configuration. Run the following command:

* Check that the missing numaresourcesoperator-worker configmap CR is applied:

```terminal
$ oc get configmap
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                           DATA   AGE
0e2a6bd3.openshift-kni.io      0      6d21h
kube-root-ca.crt               1      6d21h
numaresourcesoperator-worker   1      5m
openshift-service-ca.crt       1      6d21h
topo-aware-scheduler-config    1      6d18h
```


## Collecting NUMA Resources Operator data

You can use the oc adm must-gather CLI command to collect information about your cluster, including features and objects associated with the NUMA Resources Operator.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* To collect NUMA Resources Operator data with must-gather, you must specify the NUMA Resources Operator must-gather image.

```terminal
$ oc adm must-gather --image=registry.redhat.io/openshift4/numaresources-must-gather-rhel9:v{product-version}
```
