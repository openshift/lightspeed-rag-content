# Supported compliance profiles


There are several profiles available as part of the Compliance Operator (CO)
installation. While you can use the following profiles to assess gaps in a
cluster, usage alone does not infer or guarantee compliance with a particular
profile and is not an auditor.
In order to be compliant or certified under these various standards, you need
to engage an authorized auditor such as a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA),
Joint Authorization Board (JAB), or other industry recognized regulatory
authority to assess your environment. You are required to work with an
authorized auditor to achieve compliance with a standard.
For more information on compliance support for all Red Hat products, see Product Compliance.

----
The Compliance Operator might report incorrect results on some managed platforms, such as OpenShift Dedicated and Azure Red Hat OpenShift. For more information, see the Red Hat Knowledgebase Solution #6983418.

# Compliance profiles

The Compliance Operator provides profiles to meet industry standard benchmarks.


[NOTE]
----
The following tables reflect the latest available profiles in the Compliance Operator.
----

## CIS compliance profiles



1. The  ocp4-cis and ocp4-cis-node profiles maintain the most up-to-date version of the CIS benchmark as it becomes available in the Compliance Operator. If you want to adhere to a specific version, such as CIS v1.4.0, use the ocp4-cis-1-4 and ocp4-cis-node-1-4 profiles.
2. Node profiles must be used with the relevant Platform profile. For more information, see Compliance Operator profile types.
3. CIS v1.4.0 is superceded by CIS v1.5.0. It is recommended to apply the latest profile to your environment.
4. To locate the CIS {product-title} v4 Benchmark, go to  CIS Benchmarks and click Download Latest CIS Benchmark, where you can then register to download the benchmark.

## BSI Profile Support

BSI (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik, Germany’s Federal Office for Information Security) compliance is legally mandated under Germany’s IT Security Act (IT-Sicherheitsgesetz) for critical infrastructure sectors like energy, healthcare, and telecommunications. With the release of Compliance Operator 1.7.0, BSI compliance checks for Block SYS.1.6 Containerization and Block APP.4.4 Kubernetes are now available. For more information, see BSI Quick Check.

## Essential Eight compliance profiles



## FedRAMP High compliance profiles


[IMPORTANT]
----
Applying automatic remedations to any profile, such as rhcos4-stig, that uses the service-sshd-disabled rule, automatically disables the sshd service. This situation blocks SSH access to control plane nodes and compute nodes. To keep the SSH access enabled, create a TailoredProfile object and set the rhcos4-service-sshd-disabled rule value for the disableRules parameter.
----



1. The  ocp4-high, ocp4-high-node and rhcos4-high profiles maintain the most up-to-date version of the FedRAMP High standard as it becomes available in the Compliance Operator. If you want to adhere to a specific version, such as FedRAMP high R4, use the ocp4-high-rev-4 and ocp4-high-node-rev-4 profiles.
2. Node profiles must be used with the relevant Platform profile. For more information, see Compliance Operator profile types.

## FedRAMP Moderate compliance profiles



1. The  ocp4-moderate, ocp4-moderate-node and rhcos4-moderate profiles maintain the most up-to-date version of the FedRAMP Moderate standard as it becomes available in the Compliance Operator. If you want to adhere to a specific version, such as FedRAMP Moderate R4, use the ocp4-moderate-rev-4 and ocp4-moderate-node-rev-4 profiles.
2. Node profiles must be used with the relevant Platform profile. For more information, see Compliance Operator profile types.

## NERC-CIP compliance profiles



1. Node profiles must be used with the relevant Platform profile. For more information, see Compliance Operator profile types.

## PCI-DSS compliance profiles



1. The  ocp4-pci-dss and ocp4-pci-dss-node profiles maintain the most up-to-date version of the PCI-DSS standard as it becomes available in the Compliance Operator. If you want to adhere to a specific version, such as PCI-DSS v3.2.1, use the ocp4-pci-dss-3-2 and ocp4-pci-dss-node-3-2 profiles.
2. Node profiles must be used with the relevant Platform profile. For more information, see Compliance Operator profile types.
3. PCI-DSS v3.2.1 is superceded by PCI-DSS v4. It is recommended to apply the latest profile to your environment.

## STIG compliance profiles


[IMPORTANT]
----
Applying automatic remedations to any profile, such as rhcos4-stig, that uses the service-sshd-disabled rule, automatically disables the sshd service. This situation blocks SSH access to control plane nodes and compute nodes. To keep the SSH access enabled, create a TailoredProfile object and set the rhcos4-service-sshd-disabled rule value for the disableRules parameter.
----



1. The  ocp4-stig, ocp4-stig-node and rhcos4-stig profiles maintain the most up-to-date version of the DISA-STIG benchmark as it becomes available in the Compliance Operator. If you want to adhere to a specific version, such as DISA-STIG V2R1, use the ocp4-stig-v2r1 and ocp4-stig-node-v2r1 profiles.
2. Node profiles must be used with the relevant Platform profile. For more information, see Compliance Operator profile types.
3. DISA-STIG V1R1 is superceded by DISA-STIG V2R1. It is recommended to apply the latest profile to your environment.

## About extended compliance profiles

Some compliance profiles have controls that require following industry best practices, resulting in some profiles extending others. Combining the Center for Internet Security (CIS) best practices with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) security frameworks establishes a path to a secure and compliant environment.

For example, the NIST High-Impact and Moderate-Impact profiles extend the CIS profile to achieve compliance. As a result, extended compliance profiles eliminate the need to run both profiles in a single cluster.



## Compliance Operator profile types

Compliance Operator rules are organized into profiles. Profiles can target the Platform or Nodes for {product-title}, and some benchmarks include rhcos4 Node profiles.

Platform:: Platform profiles evaluate your {product-title} cluster components. For example, a Platform-level rule can confirm whether APIServer configurations are using strong encryption cyphers.
Node:: Node profiles evaluate the OpenShift or RHCOS configuration of each host. You can use two Node profiles: ocp4 Node profiles and rhcos4 Node profiles. The ocp4 Node profiles evaluate the OpenShift configuration of each host. For example, they can confirm whether kubeconfig files have the correct permissions to meet a compliance standard. The rhcos4 Node profiles evaluate the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) configuration of each host. For example, they can confirm whether the SSHD service is configured to disable password logins.


[IMPORTANT]
----
For benchmarks that have Node and Platform profiles, such as PCI-DSS, you must run both profiles in your {product-title} environment.
For benchmarks that have ocp4 Platform, ocp4 Node, and rhcos4 Node profiles, such as FedRAMP High, you must run all three profiles in your {product-title} environment.
----


[NOTE]
----
In a cluster with many Nodes, both ocp4 Node and rhcos4 Node scans might take a long time to complete.
