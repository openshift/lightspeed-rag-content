# Installing the External Secrets Operator for Red Hat OpenShift


To manage external secrets on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, install the External Secrets Operator by using the web console or the command-line interface (CLI).

# Limitations of External Secrets Operator for Red Hat OpenShift

The following are the limitations of External Secrets Operator for Red Hat OpenShift during the installation and uninstallation of the external-secrets application.

* Uninstalling the External Secrets Operator for Red Hat OpenShift does not delete the resources created for external-secrets application. you must clean up the resources manually.
* When you add cert-manager Operator configurations in externalsecrets.operator.openshift.io object after creation, delete the external-secrets-cert-controller deployment resource manually to prevent degradation of the external-secrets application.
* Enable the BitwardenSecretManagerProvider field in externalsecrets.operator.openshift.io object only when installed on OpenShift Cluster running on x86_64 and arm64 architectures .
* Ensure cert-manager Operator is installed and operational before deploying the External Secrets Operator for Red Hat OpenShift for seamless functioning. If you install the cert-manager Operator later, manually restart the external-secrets-operator pod to apply cert-manager configurations in externalsecrets.operator.openshift.io object.

external-secrets-operator.v1.0.0   External Secrets Operator for Red Hat OpenShift   1.0.0                Succeeded
```

3. Verify that the status of the External Secrets Operator is Running by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get pods -n external-secrets-operator
```


The following is example output verifying the External Secrets Operator is Running.

```terminal
NAME                                                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
