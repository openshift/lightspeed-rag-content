# About the External Secrets Operator for Red Hat OpenShift

Use the External Secrets Operator for Red Hat OpenShift to integrate external-secrets application with the {product-title} cluster. The external-secrets application fetches secrets stored in the external providers such as AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Google Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault, IBM Cloud Secrets Manager, AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store and integrates them with Kubernetes in a secure manner.

Using the External Secrets Operator ensures the following:

* Decouples applications from the secret-lifecycle management.
* Centralizes secret storage to support compliance requirements.
* Enables secure and automated secret rotation.
* Supports multi-cloud secret sourcing with fine-grained access control.
* Centralizes and audits access control.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not attempt to use more than one External Secrets Operator in your cluster. If you have a community External Secrets Operator installed in your cluster, you must uninstall it before installing the External Secrets Operator for Red Hat OpenShift.
