The following migration versions have been fully tested.


[NOTE]
----
The migration does not support rollbacks.

# Deleting the community External Secrets Operator

Delete the configuration resource for the community Operator so that the legacy application is fully removed. This action prevents conflicts before installing the External Secrets Operator for Red Hat OpenShift.

* You must be logged in as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You must have the oc command-line tool installed and configured.

1. Find your community Operator's namespace by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get operatorconfigs.operator.external-secrets.io -A
```


The following is an example of finding the namespace:

```terminal
NAMESPACE             NAME        AGE
external-secrets      cluster     9m18s
```

2. Delete the operatorconfig by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete operatorconfig <config_name> -n <operator_namespace>
```


1. To verify that the operatorconfig is deleted, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get operatorconfig -n <operator_namespace>
```


The command must return no resource found.
2. To verify that the old webhooks are deleted, run the following commands:

```terminal
$ oc get validatingwebhookconfigurations | grep external-secrets
```


```terminal
$ oc get mutatingwebhookconfigurations | grep external-secrets
```


The commands must return no results.

# Uninstalling the community External Secrets Operator

Uninstall the community External Secrets Operator to prevent conflicts or accidental recreation after you migrate to External Secrets Operator for Red Hat OpenShift.

You must uninstall the community External Secrets Operator to prevent it from being recreated or conflicting with the new one. The steps to uninstall are different based on how the community External Secrets Operator was installed but the prerequisites are the same for each.

* You must be logged in as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You must have deleted the operatorconfig.

## Uninstalling a helm installed community External Secrets Operator

Remove the community External Secrets Operator that was installed using Helm. This helps you free up resources and maintain a clean environment for your cluster.

1. Install the External Secrets Operator for Red Hat OpenShift. The external-secrets-operator namespace must be null.
2. Delete the {external-secrets-short} by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc helm delete <release_name> -n <operator_namespace>
```


[NOTE]
----
Using helm delete might delete all Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and CRs. It is recommended to installl the downstream Operator first if the namespace external-secrets-operator is empty.
----

## Uninstalling an Operator Lifecylce Manager installed community External Secrets Operator

Remove the community External Secrets Operator that was installed by an Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) subscription. This helps you free up resources and maintain a clean environment for your cluster.

1. Find the subscription name by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get subscription -n <operator_namespace> | grep external-secrets
```

2. Delete the subscription by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete subscription <subscription_name> -n <operator_namespace>
```

3. Delete the ClusterServiceVersion by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete csv <csv_name> -n <operator_namespace>
```


## Uninstalling a raw manifest installed community External Secrets Operator

Remove the community External Secrets Operator that was installed by raw manifests. This helps you free up resources and maintain a clean environment for your cluster.

* To remove the communiity External Secrets Operator that was installed by raw manifests, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete -f /path/to/your/old/manifests.yaml -n <operator_namespace>
```


# Installing the External Secrets Operator for Red Hat OpenShift

Install the External Secrets Operator for Red Hat OpenShift after cleaning up the community version. This establishes the officially supported service for managing secrets in your cluster. For more information, see Installing the External Secrets Operator for Red Hat OpenShift.

# Creating the ExternalSecretsConfig Operator

Create the ExternalSecretsConfig resource to install and configure the core external-secrets component. This setup helps ensure that features like Bitwarden and cert-manager support are correctly enabled.

* External Secrets Operator for Red Hat OpenShift is installed.
* cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift is installed.
* You have access to the cluster with cluster-admin privileges.

1. Create an externalsecretsconfig file by defining a YAML file with the following content:

```yml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ExternalSecretsConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: cluster
  name: cluster
spec:
  appConfig:
    logLevel: 3
  webhookConfig:
    certificateCheckInterval: 5m0s
  controllerConfig:
    certProvider:
      certManager:
        certificateDuration: 8760h0m0s
        certificateRenewBefore: 30m0s
        injectAnnotations: "true"
        issuerRef:
          group: cert-manager.io
          kind: Issuer
          name: _<created_issuer_name>_
    mode: Enabled
    networkPolicies:
    - componentName: ExternalSecretsCoreController
      egress:
      - ports:
        - port: 443
          protocol: TCP
        - port: 9998
          protocol: TCP
        name: allow-external-secrets-egress
    plugins:
      bitwardenSecretManagerProvider:
        mode: Enabled
```

2. Create the ExternalSecretsConfig object by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f externalsecretsconfig.yaml
```


Verify that all custom resources (CRs) are present and that the APIs are using v1 instead of v1beta1. There CRs are retained and automatically converted by the new Operator.

1. To verify that the external-secrets pods are in a running state, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get pods -n external-secret
```


The following is example output that the external-secrets pods are in a running state.

```terminal
NAME                                          READY        STATUS        RESTARTS     AGE
bitwarden-sdk-server-5b4cf48766-w7zp7         1/1          Running       0            5m
external-secrets-5854b85dd5-m6zf9             1/1          Running       0            5m
external-secrets-webhook-5cb85b8fdb-6jtqb     1/1          Running       0            5m
```

2. To verify that the SecretStore CR is present, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get secretstores.external-secrets.io -A
```


The following is example output from validating that the SecretStore is present:

```terminal
NAMESPACE               NAME                         AGE         STATUS      CAPABILITIES    READY
external-secrets-1      gcp-store                    18min       Valid       ReadWrite       True
external-secrets-2      aws-secretstore              11min       Valid       ReadWrite       True
external-secrets        bitwarden-secretsmanager     20min       Valid       Readwrite       True
```

3. To verify that the ExternalSecret CR is present, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get externalsecrets.external-secrets.io -A
```


The following is example output from validating that the SecretStore is present:

```terminal
NAMESPACE             NAME                    STORE                      REFRESH INTERVAL    STATUS          READY
external-secrets-1    gcp-externalsecret      gcp-store                  1hr                 SecretSynced    True
external-secrets-2    aws-external-secret     aws-secret-store           1hr                 SecretSynced    True
external-secrets      bitwarden               bitwarden-secretsmanager   1hr                 SecretSynced    True
```

4. To verify that the SecretStore is apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get secretstores.external-secrets.io -n external-secrets-1 gcp-store -o yaml
```


The following is example output that the SecretStore is apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1.
