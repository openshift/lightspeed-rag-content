# Securing networks


Network security can be managed at several levels. At the pod level,
network namespaces can prevent containers from seeing other pods or
the host system by restricting network access. Network policies
give you control over allowing and rejecting connections.
You can manage ingress and egress traffic to and from your
containerized applications.

# Using network namespaces

{product-title} uses software-defined networking (SDN) to provide a unified
cluster network that enables communication between containers across the
cluster.

Network policy mode, by default, makes all pods in a project accessible from
other pods and network endpoints.
To isolate one or more pods in a project, you can create NetworkPolicy objects
in that project to indicate the allowed incoming connections.
Using multitenant mode, you can provide project-level isolation for pods and services.

# Isolating pods with network policies

Using network policies, you can isolate pods from each other in the same project.
Network policies can deny all network access to a pod,
only allow connections for the Ingress Controller, reject connections from
pods in other projects, or set similar rules for how networks behave.

# Using multiple pod networks

Each running container has only one network interface by default.
The Multus CNI plugin lets you create multiple CNI networks, and then
attach any of those networks to your pods. In that way, you can do
things like separate private data onto a more restricted network
and have multiple network interfaces on each node.

# Isolating applications

{product-title} enables you to segment network traffic on a single cluster to
make multitenant clusters that isolate users, teams, applications, and
environments from non-global resources.

# Securing ingress traffic

There are many security implications related to how you configure
access to your Kubernetes services from outside of your {product-title} cluster.
Besides exposing HTTP and HTTPS routes, ingress routing allows you to set up
NodePort or LoadBalancer ingress types. NodePort exposes an application&#8217;s
service API object from each cluster worker. LoadBalancer lets you assign an
external load balancer to an associated service API object
in your {product-title} cluster.

# Securing egress traffic

{product-title} provides the ability to control egress traffic using either
a router or firewall method. For example, you can use the IP allow list to control database access.
A cluster administrator can assign one or more egress IP addresses to a project by configuring an egress IP address.
Likewise, a cluster administrator can prevent egress traffic from
going outside of an {product-title} cluster using an egress firewall.

By assigning a fixed egress IP address, you can have all outgoing traffic
assigned to that IP address for a particular project.
With the egress firewall, you can prevent a pod from connecting to an
external network, prevent a pod from connecting to an internal network,
or limit a pod&#8217;s access to specific internal subnets.
