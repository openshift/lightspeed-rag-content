# Installing the File Integrity Operator using the CLI

* You must have admin privileges.

1. Create a Namespace object YAML file by running:

```terminal
$ oc create -f <file-name>.yaml
```

Example output

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  labels:
    openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: privileged 1
  name: openshift-file-integrity
```

In {product-title} {product-version}, the pod security label must be set to privileged at the namespace level.
2. Create the OperatorGroup object YAML file:

```terminal
$ oc create -f <file-name>.yaml
```

Example output

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup

  name: file-integrity-operator
  namespace: openshift-file-integrity
spec:
  targetNamespaces:
  - openshift-file-integrity

  namespace: openshift-file-integrity
spec:
  channel: "stable"
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
