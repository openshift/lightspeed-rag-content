# Updating the File Integrity Operator


As a cluster administrator, you can update the File Integrity Operator on your {product-title} cluster.

# Preparing for an Operator update

The subscription of an installed Operator specifies an update channel that tracks and receives updates for the Operator. You can change the update channel to start tracking and receiving updates from a newer channel.

The names of update channels in a subscription can differ between Operators, but the naming scheme typically follows a common convention within a given Operator. For example, channel names might follow a minor release update stream for the application provided by the Operator (1.2, 1.3) or a release frequency (stable, fast).


[NOTE]
----
You cannot change installed Operators to a channel that is older than the current channel.

Red Hat Customer Portal Labs include the following application that helps administrators prepare to update their Operators:

* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Operator Update Information Checker

You can use the application to search for Operator Lifecycle Manager-based Operators and verify the available Operator version per update channel across different versions of {product-title}. Cluster Version Operator-based Operators are not included.

# Changing the update channel for an Operator

You can change the update channel for an Operator by using the {product-title} web console.


[TIP]
----
If the approval strategy in the subscription is set to Automatic, the update process initiates as soon as a new Operator version is available in the selected channel. If the approval strategy is set to Manual, you must manually approve pending updates.

# Manually approving a pending Operator update
