# Monitoring cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift


By default, the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift exposes metrics for the three core components: controller, cainjector, and webhook. You can configure OpenShift Monitoring to collect these metrics by using the Prometheus Operator format.

# Enabling user workload monitoring

You can enable monitoring for user-defined projects by configuring user workload monitoring in the cluster. For more information, see "Setting up metrics collection for user-defined projects".

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

1. Create the cluster-monitoring-config.yaml YAML file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    enableUserWorkload: true
```

2. Apply the ConfigMap by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f cluster-monitoring-config.yaml
```


1. Verify that the monitoring components for user workloads are running in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring namespace by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring get pod
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
prometheus-operator-6cb6bd9588-dtzxq   2/2     Running   0          50s
prometheus-user-workload-0             6/6     Running   0          48s
prometheus-user-workload-1             6/6     Running   0          48s
thanos-ruler-user-workload-0           4/4     Running   0          42s
thanos-ruler-user-workload-1           4/4     Running   0          42s
```


The status of the pods such as prometheus-operator, prometheus-user-workload, and thanos-ruler-user-workload must be Running.

# Configuring metrics collection for cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift operands by using a ServiceMonitor

The cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift operands exposes metrics by default on port 9402 at the /metrics service endpoint. You can configure metrics collection for the cert-manager operands by creating a ServiceMonitor custom resource (CR) that enables Prometheus Operator to collect custom metrics. For more information, see "Configuring user workload monitoring".

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You have installed the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift.
* You have enabled the user workload monitoring.

1. Create the ServiceMonitor CR:
1. Create the YAML file that defines the ServiceMonitor CR:
Example servicemonitor-cert-manager.yaml file

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  labels:
    app: cert-manager
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: cert-manager
    app.kubernetes.io/name: cert-manager
  name: cert-manager
  namespace: cert-manager
spec:
  endpoints:
    - honorLabels: false
      interval: 60s
      path: /metrics
      scrapeTimeout: 30s
      targetPort: 9402
  selector:
    matchExpressions:
      - key: app.kubernetes.io/name
        operator: In
        values:
          - cainjector
          - cert-manager
          - webhook
      - key: app.kubernetes.io/instance
        operator: In
        values:
          - cert-manager
      - key: app.kubernetes.io/component
        operator: In
        values:
          - cainjector
          - controller
          - webhook
```

2. Create the ServiceMonitor CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f servicemonitor-cert-manager.yaml
```


After the ServiceMonitor CR is created, the user workload Prometheus instance begins metrics collection from the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift operands. The collected metrics are labeled with job="cert-manager",job="cert-manager-cainjector", and job="cert-manager-webhook".

1. In the {product-title} web console, navigate to Observe → Targets.
2. In the Label filter field, enter the following labels to filter the metrics targets for each operand:

```terminal
$ service=cert-manager
```


```terminal
$ service=cert-manager-webhook
```


```terminal
$ service=cert-manager-cainjector
```

3. Confirm that the Status column shows Up for the cert-manager, cert-manager-webhook, and cert-manager-cainjector entries.

# Querying metrics for the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift operands

As a cluster administrator, or as a user with view access to all namespaces, you can query cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift operands metrics by using the {product-title} web console or the command-line interface (CLI). For more information, see "Accessing metrics".

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You have installed the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift.
* You have enabled monitoring and metrics collection by creating ServiceMonitor object.

1. In the {product-title} web console, navigate to Observe → Metrics.
2. In the query field, enter the following PromQL expressions to query the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift operands metric for each operand:

```promql
{job="cert-manager"}
```


```promql
{job="cert-manager-webhook"}
```


```promql
{job="cert-manager-cainjector"}
```

# Configuring metrics collection for the istio-csr operand

The istio-csr operand exposes metrics by default on port 9402 at the /metrics service endpoint. You can configure metrics collection for the operand by creating a ServiceMonitor custom resource (CR), which enables the Prometheus Operator to collect custom metrics. For more information, see "Configuring user workload monitoring".

* You have access to the cluster with cluster-admin privileges.
* You have installed the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift.
* You have enabled user workload monitoring.

1. Create the ServiceMonitor CR definition file:
Example servicemonitor-istio-csr.yaml file

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  labels:
    app: cert-manager-istio-csr
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: cert-manager-istio-csr
    app.kubernetes.io/name: cert-manager-istio-csr
  name: cert-manager-istio-csr
  namespace: <istio_csr_project_name> 1
spec:
  endpoints:
    - honorLabels: false
      interval: 60s
      path: /metrics
      scrapeTimeout: 30s
      targetPort: 9402
  namespaceSelector:
    matchNames:
      - <istio_csr_project_name> 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: cert-manager-istio-csr
      app.kubernetes.io/instance: cert-manager-istio-csr
      app.kubernetes.io/name: cert-manager-istio-csr
```

Replace <istio_csr_project_name> with the namespace where you created the IstioCSR CR.
2. Create the ServiceMonitor CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f servicemonitor-istio-csr.yaml
```


After the ServiceMonitor CR is created, the user workload Prometheus instance starts collecting metrics from the istio-csr operand. The collected metrics are labeled with job="cert-manager-istio-csr".

1. Log in to the {product-title} web console.
2. Click Observe -> Targets.
3. In the Label filter field, enter the service=cert-manager-istio-csr label to filter the metrics targets.
4. Confirm that the Status column shows Up for the cert-manager-istio-csr target.

* Configuring user workload monitoring

# Querying metrics for the istio-csr operand

Cluster administrators, or users with view access to all namespaces, can query metrics for the istio-csr operand by using the {product-title} web console. For more information, see "Accessing metrics".

* You have access to the cluster with cluster-admin privileges.
* You have installed the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift.
* You have enabled monitoring and metrics collection by creating the ServiceMonitor object for the istio-csr operand.

1. Log in to the {product-title} web console.
2. Click Observe -> Metrics.
3. In the query field, enter the following PromQL expression to query the istio-csr operand metrics:

{job="cert-manager-istio-csr"}

The results display metrics collected for the istio-csr operand, which can help you monitor its performance and behavior.
