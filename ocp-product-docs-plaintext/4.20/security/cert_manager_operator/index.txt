# cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift overview


The cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift is a cluster-wide service that provides application certificate lifecycle management. The cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift allows you to integrate with external certificate authorities and provides certificate provisioning, renewal, and retirement.

# About the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift

The cert-manager project introduces certificate authorities and certificates as resource types in the Kubernetes API, which makes it possible to provide certificates on demand to developers working within your cluster. The cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift provides a supported way to integrate cert-manager into your {product-title} cluster.

The cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift provides the following features:

* Support for integrating with external certificate authorities
* Tools to manage certificates
* Ability for developers to self-serve certificates
* Automatic certificate renewal


[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not attempt to use both cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift for {product-title} and the community cert-manager Operator at the same time in your cluster.
Also, you should not install cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift for {product-title} in multiple namespaces within a single OpenShift cluster.

# Certificate request methods

There are two ways to request a certificate using the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift:

Using the cert-manager.io/CertificateRequest object:: With this method a service developer creates a CertificateRequest object with a valid issuerRef pointing to a configured issuer (configured by a service infrastructure administrator). A service infrastructure administrator then accepts or denies the certificate request. Only accepted certificate requests create a corresponding certificate.
Using the cert-manager.io/Certificate object:: With this method, a service developer creates a Certificate object with a valid issuerRef and obtains a certificate from a secret that they pointed to the Certificate object.

# Supported cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift versions

For the list of supported versions of the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift across different {product-title} releases, see the "Platform Agnostic Operators" section in the {product-title} update and support policy.

# About FIPS compliance for cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift

Starting with version 1.14.0, cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift is designed for FIPS compliance. When running on {product-title} in FIPS mode, it uses the RHEL cryptographic libraries submitted to NIST for FIPS validation on the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390X architectures. For more information about the NIST validation program, see Cryptographic module validation program. For the latest NIST status for the individual versions of the RHEL cryptographic libraries submitted for validation, see Compliance activities and government standards.

To enable FIPS mode, you must install cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift on an {product-title} cluster configured to operate in FIPS mode. For more information, see "Do you need extra security for your cluster?"
