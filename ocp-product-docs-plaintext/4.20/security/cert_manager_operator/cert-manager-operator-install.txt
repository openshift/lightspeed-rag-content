# Understanding update channels of the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift

Update channels are the mechanism by which you can declare the version of your cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift in your cluster. The cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift offers the following update channels:

* stable-v1
* stable-v1.y

## stable-v1 channel

The stable-v1 channel installs and updates the latest release version of the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift. Select the stable-v1 channel if you want to use the latest stable release of the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift.


[NOTE]
----
The stable-v1 channel is the default and suggested channel while installing the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift.
----

The stable-v1 channel offers the following update approval strategies:

Automatic:: If you choose automatic updates for an installed cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift, a new version of the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift is available in the stable-v1 channel. The Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically upgrades the running instance of your Operator without human intervention.
Manual:: If you select manual updates, when a newer version of the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift is available, OLM creates an update request. As a cluster administrator, you must then manually approve that update request to have the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift updated to the new version.

## stable-v1.y channel

The y-stream version of the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift installs updates from the stable-v1.y channels such as stable-v1.10, stable-v1.11, and stable-v1.12. Select the stable-v1.y channel if you want to use the y-stream version and stay updated to the z-stream version of the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift.

The stable-v1.y channel offers the following update approval strategies:

Automatic:: If you choose automatic updates for an installed cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift, a new z-stream version of the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift is available in the stable-v1.y channel. OLM automatically upgrades the running instance of your Operator without human intervention.
Manual:: If you select manual updates, when a newer version of the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift is available, OLM creates an update request. As a cluster administrator, you must then manually approve that update request to have the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift updated to the new version of the z-stream releases.
