# Zero Trust Workload Identity Manager overview


The Zero Trust Workload Identity Manager is an {product-title} Operator that manages the lifecycle of SPIFFE Runtime Environment (SPIRE) components. It enables workload identity management based on the Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone (SPIFFE) standard, providing cryptographically verifiable identities (SVIDs) to workloads running in {product-title} clusters.
The following are  components of the Zero Trust Workload Identity Manager architecture:

# SPIFFE

Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone (SPIFFE) provides a standardized way to establish trust between software workloads in distributed systems. SPIFFE assigns unique IDs called SPIFFE IDs. These IDs are Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) that include a trust domain and a workload identifier.

The SPIFFE IDs are contained in the SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Document (SVID). SVIDs are used by workloads to verify their identity to other workloads so that the workloads can communicate with each other. The two main SVID formats are:

* X.509-SVIDs: X.509 certificates where the SPIFFE ID is embedded in the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field.
* JWT-SVIDs: JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) where the SPIFFE ID is included as the sub claim.

For more information, see SPIFFE Overview.

# SPIRE Server

A SPIRE Server is responsible for managing and issuing SPIFFE identities within a trust domain. It stores registration entries (selectors that determine under what conditions a SPIFFE ID should be issued) and signing keys. The SPIRE Server works in conjunction with the SPIRE Agent to perform node attestion via node plugins. For more information, see About the SPIRE Server.

# SPIRE Agent

The SPIRE Agent is responsible for workload attestation, ensuring that workloads receive a verified identity when requesting authentication through the SPIFFE Workload API. It accomplishes this by using configured workload attestor plugins. In Kubernetes environments, the Kubernetes workload attestor plugin is used.

SPIRE and the SPIRE Agent perform node attestation via node plugins. The plugins are used to verify the identity of the node on which the agent is running. For more information, see About the SPIRE Agent.

# Attestation

Attestation is the process by which the identity of nodes and workloads are verified before SPIFFE IDs and SVIDs are issued. The SPIRE Server gathers attributes of both the workload and node that the SPIRE Agent runs on, and then compares them to a set of selectors defined when the workload was registered. If the comparison is successful, the entities are provided with credentials. This ensures that only legitimate and expected entities within the trust domain receive cryptographic identities. The two main types of attestation in SPIFFE/SPIRE are:

* Node attestation: verifies the identity of a machine or a node on a system, before a SPIRE Agent running on that node can be trusted to request identities for workloads.
* Workload attestation: verifies the identity of an application or service running on an attested node before the SPIRE Agent on that node can provide it with a SPIFFE ID and SVID.
