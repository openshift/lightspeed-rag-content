# Changing control plane configuration options for VMware vSphere


You can update your control plane machines to reflect changes in your infrastructure or environment by editing values in the control plane machine set specification.
When you save an update to the control plane machine set, the Control Plane Machine Set Operator updates the control plane machines according to your configured update strategy.
For more information, see "Updating the control plane configuration".
The following example YAML snippets show provider specification and failure domain configurations for a vSphere cluster.

# Sample VMware vSphere provider specification

When you create a control plane machine set for an existing cluster, the provider specification must match the providerSpec configuration in the control plane machine custom resource (CR) that the installation program creates.


```yaml
apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1
kind: ControlPlaneMachineSet
metadata:
  name: cluster
  namespace: openshift-machine-api
spec:
# ...
  template:
# ...
      spec:
        providerSpec:
          value:
            apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
            credentialsSecret:
              name: vsphere-cloud-credentials 1
            dataDisks: 2
            - name: "<disk_name>"
              provisioningMode: "<mode>"
              sizeGiB: 20
            diskGiB: 120 3
            kind: VSphereMachineProviderSpec 4
            memoryMiB: 16384 5
            metadata:
              creationTimestamp: null
            network: 6
              devices:
              - networkName: <vm_network_name>
            numCPUs: 4 7
            numCoresPerSocket: 4 8
            snapshot: ""
            template: <vm_template_name> 9
            userDataSecret:
              name: master-user-data 10
            workspace: 11
              datacenter: <vcenter_data_center_name> 12
              datastore: <vcenter_datastore_name> 13
              folder: <path_to_vcenter_vm_folder> 14
              resourcePool: <vsphere_resource_pool> 15
              server: <vcenter_server_ip> 16
```


Specifies the secret name for the cluster. Do not change this value.
Specifies one or more data disk definitions.
For more information, see "Configuring data disks by using machine sets".
Specifies the VM disk size for the control plane machines.
Specifies the cloud provider platform type. Do not change this value.
Specifies the memory allocated for the control plane machines.
Specifies the network on which the control plane is deployed.

[NOTE]
----
If the cluster is configured to use a failure domain, this parameter is configured in the failure domain.
If you specify this value in the provider specification when using failure domains, the Control Plane Machine Set Operator ignores it.
----
Specifies the number of CPUs allocated for the control plane machines.
Specifies the number of cores for each control plane CPU.
Specifies the vSphere VM template to use, such as user-5ddjd-rhcos.

[NOTE]
----
If the cluster is configured to use a failure domain, this parameter is configured in the failure domain.
If you specify this value in the provider specification when using failure domains, the Control Plane Machine Set Operator ignores it.
----
Specifies the control plane user data secret. Do not change this value.
Specifies the workspace details for the control plane.

[NOTE]
----
If the cluster is configured to use a failure domain, these parameters are configured in the failure domain.
If you specify these values in the provider specification when using failure domains, the Control Plane Machine Set Operator ignores them.
----
Specifies the vCenter datacenter for the control plane.
Specifies the vCenter datastore for the control plane.
Specifies the path to the vSphere VM folder in vCenter, such as /dc1/vm/user-inst-5ddjd.
Specifies the vSphere resource pool for your VMs.
Specifies the vCenter server IP or fully qualified domain name.

# Sample VMware vSphere failure domain configuration

On VMware vSphere infrastructure, the cluster-wide infrastructure Custom Resource Definition (CRD), infrastructures.config.openshift.io, defines failure domains for your cluster.
The providerSpec in the ControlPlaneMachineSet custom resource (CR) specifies names for failure domains that the control plane machine set uses to ensure control plane nodes are deployed to the appropriate failure domain.
A failure domain is an infrastructure resource made up of a control plane machine set, a vCenter data center, vCenter datastore, and a network.

By using a failure domain resource, you can use a control plane machine set to deploy control plane machines on  separate clusters or data centers.
A control plane machine set also balances control plane machines across defined failure domains to provide fault tolerance capabilities to your infrastructure.


[NOTE]
----
If you modify the ProviderSpec configuration in the ControlPlaneMachineSet CR, the control plane machine set updates all control plane machines deployed on the primary infrastructure and each failure domain infrastructure.
----


```yaml
apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1
kind: ControlPlaneMachineSet
metadata:
  name: cluster
  namespace: openshift-machine-api
spec:
# ...
  template:
# ...
    machines_v1beta1_machine_openshift_io:
      failureDomains: 1
        platform: VSphere
        vsphere: 2
        - name: <failure_domain_name_1>
        - name: <failure_domain_name_2>
# ...
```


Specifies the vCenter location for {product-title} cluster nodes.
Specifies failure domains by name for the control plane machine set.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Each name field value in this section must match the corresponding value in the failureDomains.name field of the cluster-wide infrastructure CRD.
You can find the value of the failureDomains.name field by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get infrastructure cluster -o=jsonpath={.spec.platformSpec.vsphere.failureDomains[0].name}
```

The name field is the only supported failure domain field that you can specify in the ControlPlaneMachineSet CR.
----

For an example of a cluster-wide infrastructure CRD that defines resources for each failure domain, see "Specifying multiple regions and zones for your cluster on vSphere."
