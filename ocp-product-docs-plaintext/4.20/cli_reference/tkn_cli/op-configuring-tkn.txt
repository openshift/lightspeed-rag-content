# Configuring the OpenShift Pipelines tkn CLI


Configure the Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines tkn CLI to enable tab completion.

# Enabling tab completion

After you install the tkn CLI, you can enable tab completion to automatically complete tkn commands or suggest options when you press Tab.

* You must have the tkn CLI tool installed.
* You must have bash-completion installed on your local system.

The following procedure enables tab completion for Bash.

1. Save the Bash completion code to a file:

```terminal
$ tkn completion bash > tkn_bash_completion
```

2. Copy the file to /etc/bash_completion.d/:

```terminal
$ sudo cp tkn_bash_completion /etc/bash_completion.d/
```


Alternatively, you can save the file to a local directory and source it from your .bashrc file instead.

Tab completion is enabled when you open a new terminal.
