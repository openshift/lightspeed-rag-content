# Getting started with OpenShift Virtualization


You can explore the features and functionalities of OpenShift Virtualization by installing and configuring a basic environment.

[NOTE]
----
Cluster configuration procedures require cluster-admin privileges.
----

# Tours and quick starts

You can start exploring OpenShift Virtualization by taking tours in the {product-title} web console.

## Getting started tour

This short guided tour introduces several key aspects of using OpenShift Virtualization. There are two ways to start the tour:

* On the Welcome to OpenShift Virtualization dialog, click Start Tour.
* Go to Virtualization -> Overview -> Settings -> User -> Getting started resources and click Guided tour.

## Quick starts

Quick start tours are available for several OpenShift Virtualization features. To access quick starts, complete the following steps:

1. Click the Help icon ? in the menu bar on the header of the {product-title} web console.
2. Select Quick Starts.

You can filter the available tours by entering the keyword virtual in the Filter field.

# Planning and installing OpenShift Virtualization

Plan and install OpenShift Virtualization on an {product-title} cluster:

* Plan your bare metal cluster for OpenShift Virtualization.
* Prepare your cluster for OpenShift Virtualization.
* Install the OpenShift Virtualization Operator.
* Install the virtctl command-line interface (CLI) tool.

## Planning and installation resources

* About storage volumes for virtual machine disks.
* Using a CSI-enabled storage provider.
* Configuring local storage for virtual machines.
* Installing the Kubernetes NMState Operator.
* Specifying nodes for virtual machines.
* Virtctl commands.

# Creating and managing virtual machines

Create a virtual machine (VM):

* Create a VM from a Red Hat image.

You can create a VM by using a Red Hat template or an instance type.
* You can create a VM by importing a custom image from a container registry or a web page, by uploading an image from your local machine, or by cloning a persistent volume claim (PVC).

Connect a VM to a secondary network:

* Linux bridge network.
* Open Virtual Network (OVN)-Kubernetes secondary network.
* Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) network.

[NOTE]
----
VMs are connected to the pod network by default.
----

Connect to a VM:

* Connect to the serial console or VNC console of a VM.
* Connect to a VM by using SSH.
* Connect to the desktop viewer for Windows VMs.

Manage a VM:

* Manage a VM by using the web console.
* Manage a VM by using the virtctl CLI tool.
* Export a VM.

# Migrating to OpenShift Virtualization

To migrate virtual machines from an external provider such as VMware vSphere, Red&#160;Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP), Red Hat Virtualization, or another {product-title} cluster, use the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization (MTV). You can also migrate Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) files created by VMware vSphere.


[NOTE]
----
Migration Toolkit for Virtualization is not part of OpenShift Virtualization and requires separate installation. For this reason, all links in this procedure lead outside of OpenShift Virtualization documentation.
----

* The Migration Toolkit for Virtualization Operator is installed.

* Migrate virtual machines from VMware vSphere.
* Migrate virtual machines from Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP).
* Migrate virtual machines from Red Hat Virtualization.
* Migrate virtual machines from OpenShift Virtualization.
* Migrate virtual machines from OVA files created by VMware vSphere.

# Next steps

* Review postinstallation configuration options.
* Configure storage options and automatic boot source updates.
* Learn about monitoring and health checks.
* Learn about live migration.
* Back up and restore VMs by using the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP).
* Tune and scale your cluster.
