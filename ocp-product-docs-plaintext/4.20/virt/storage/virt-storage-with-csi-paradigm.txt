# Understanding virtual machine storage with the CSI paradigm


Virtual machines (VMs) in OpenShift Virtualization use PersistentVolume (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) paradigms to manage storage. This ensures seamless integration with the Container Storage Interface (CSI).

# Virtual machine CSI storage overview

OpenShift Virtualization integrates with the Container Storage Interface (CSI) to manage VM storage. Storage classes define storage capabilities such as performance tiers and types. PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) request storage resources, which bind to PersistentVolumes (PVs). CSI drivers connect Kubernetes to vendor storage backends, including iSCSI, NFS, and Fibre Channel.
