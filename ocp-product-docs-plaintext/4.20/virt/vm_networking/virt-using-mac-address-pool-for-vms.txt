# Managing MAC address pools for network interfaces


The KubeMacPool component allocates MAC addresses for virtual machine (VM) network interfaces from a shared MAC address pool. This ensures that each network interface is assigned a unique MAC address.
A virtual machine instance created from that VM retains the assigned MAC address across reboots.

[NOTE]
----
KubeMacPool does not handle virtual machine instances created independently from a virtual machine.

# Managing KubeMacPool by using the CLI

You can disable and re-enable KubeMacPool by using the command line.

KubeMacPool is enabled by default.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* To disable KubeMacPool in two namespaces, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc label namespace <namespace1> <namespace2> mutatevirtualmachines.kubemacpool.io=ignore
```

* To re-enable KubeMacPool in two namespaces, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc label namespace <namespace1> <namespace2> mutatevirtualmachines.kubemacpool.io-
```
