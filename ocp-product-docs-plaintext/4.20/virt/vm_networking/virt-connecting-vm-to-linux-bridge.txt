# Connecting a virtual machine to a Linux bridge network


By default, OpenShift Virtualization is installed with a single, internal pod network.
You can create a Linux bridge network and attach a virtual machine (VM) to the network by performing the following steps:
1. Create a Linux bridge node network configuration policy (NNCP).
2. Create a Linux bridge network attachment definition (NAD) by using the web console or the command line.
3. Configure the VM to recognize the NAD by using the web console or the command line.

[NOTE]
----
OpenShift Virtualization does not support Linux bridge bonding modes 0, 5, and 6. For more information, see Which bonding modes work when used with a bridge that virtual machine guests or containers connect to?.
----

# Creating a Linux bridge NNCP

You can create a NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy (NNCP) manifest for a Linux bridge network.

* You have installed the Kubernetes NMState Operator.

* Create the NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy manifest. This example includes sample values that you must replace with your own information.

```yaml
apiVersion: nmstate.io/v1
kind: NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy
metadata:
  name: br1-eth1-policy 1
spec:
  desiredState:
    interfaces:
      - name: br1 2
        description: Linux bridge with eth1 as a port 3
        type: linux-bridge 4
        state: up 5
        ipv4:
          enabled: false 6
        bridge:
          options:
            stp:
              enabled: false 7
          port:
            - name: eth1 8
```

Name of the policy.
Name of the interface.
Optional: Human-readable description of the interface.
The type of interface. This example creates a bridge.
The requested state for the interface after creation.
Disables IPv4 in this example.
Disables STP in this example.
The node NIC to which the bridge is attached.


[NOTE]
----
To create the NNCP manifest for a Linux bridge using OSA with IBM Z(R), you must disable VLAN filtering by the setting the rx-vlan-filter to false in the NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy manifest.
Alternatively, if you have SSH access to the node, you can disable VLAN filtering by running the following command:

```terminal
$ sudo ethtool -K <osa-interface-name> rx-vlan-filter off
```

# Creating a Linux bridge NAD

You can create a Linux bridge network attachment definition (NAD) by using the {product-title} web console or command line.

## Creating a Linux bridge NAD by using the web console

You can create a network attachment definition (NAD) to provide layer-2 networking to pods and virtual machines by using the {product-title} web console.

A Linux bridge network attachment definition is the most efficient method for connecting a virtual machine to a VLAN.


[WARNING]
----
Configuring IP address management (IPAM) in a network attachment definition for virtual machines is not supported.
----

1. In the web console, click Networking -> NetworkAttachmentDefinitions.
2. Click Create Network Attachment Definition.

[NOTE]
----
The network attachment definition must be in the same namespace as the pod or virtual machine.
----
3. Enter a unique Name and optional Description.
4. Select CNV Linux bridge from the Network Type list.
5. Enter the name of the bridge in the Bridge Name field.
6. Optional: If the resource has VLAN IDs configured, enter the ID numbers in the VLAN Tag Number field.

[NOTE]
----
OSA interfaces on IBM Z(R) do not support VLAN filtering and VLAN-tagged traffic is dropped. Avoid using VLAN-tagged NADs with OSA interfaces.
----
7. Optional: Select MAC Spoof Check to enable MAC spoof filtering. This feature provides security against a MAC spoofing attack by allowing only a single MAC address to exit the pod.
8. Click Create.

## Creating a Linux bridge NAD by using the CLI

You can create a network attachment definition (NAD) to provide layer-2 networking to pods and virtual machines (VMs) by using the command line.

The NAD and the VM must be in the same namespace.


[WARNING]
----
Configuring IP address management (IPAM) in a network attachment definition for virtual machines is not supported.
----

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

1. Add the VM to the NetworkAttachmentDefinition configuration, as in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: "k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1"
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: bridge-network 1
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/resourceName: bridge.network.kubevirt.io/br1 2
spec:
  config: |
    {
      "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
      "name": "bridge-network", 3
      "type": "bridge", 4
      "bridge": "br1", 5
      "macspoofchk": false, 6
      "vlan": 100, 7
      "disableContainerInterface": true,
      "preserveDefaultVlan": false 8
    }
```

The name for the NetworkAttachmentDefinition object.
Optional: Annotation key-value pair for node selection for the bridge configured on some nodes. If you add this annotation to your network attachment definition, your virtual machine instances will only run on the nodes that have the defined bridge connected.
The name for the configuration. It is recommended to match the configuration name to the name value of the network attachment definition.
The actual name of the Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin that provides the network for this network attachment definition. Do not change this field unless you want to use a different CNI.
The name of the Linux bridge configured on the node. The name should match the interface bridge name defined in the NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy manifest.
Optional: A flag to enable the MAC spoof check. When set to true, you cannot change the MAC address of the pod or guest interface. This attribute allows only a single MAC address to exit the pod, which provides security against a MAC spoofing attack.
Optional: The VLAN tag. No additional VLAN configuration is required on the node network configuration policy.

[NOTE]
----
OSA interfaces on IBM Z(R) do not support VLAN filtering and VLAN-tagged traffic is dropped. Avoid using VLAN-tagged NADs with OSA interfaces.
----
Optional: Indicates whether the VM connects to the bridge through the default VLAN. The default value is true.

[NOTE]
----
A Linux bridge network attachment definition is the most efficient method for connecting a virtual machine to a VLAN.
----
2. Optional: If you want to connect a VM to the native network, configure the Linux bridge NetworkAttachmentDefinition manifest without specifying any VLAN:

```yaml
apiVersion: "k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1"
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: bridge-network
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/resourceName: bridge.network.kubevirt.io/br1
spec:
  config: |
    {
      "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
      "name": "bridge-network",
      "type": "bridge",
      "bridge": "br1",
      "macspoofchk": false,
      "disableContainerInterface": true
    }
```

3. Create the network attachment definition:

```terminal
$ oc create -f network-attachment-definition.yaml 1
```

Where network-attachment-definition.yaml is the file name of the network attachment definition manifest.

* Verify that the network attachment definition was created by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get network-attachment-definition bridge-network
```


## Enabling port isolation for a Linux bridge NAD

You can enable port isolation for a Linux bridge network attachment definition (NAD) so that virtual machines (VMs) or pods that run on the same virtual LAN (VLAN) can operate in isolation from one another. The Linux bridge NAD creates a virtual bridge, or virtual switch, between network interfaces and the physical network.

Isolating ports in this way can provide enhanced security for VM workloads that run on the same node.

* For VMs, you configured either a static or dynamic IP address for each VM. See "Configuring IP addresses for virtual machines".
* You created a Linux bridge NAD by using either the web console or the command-line interface.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

1. Edit the Linux bridge NAD by setting portIsolation to true:

```yaml
apiVersion: "k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1"
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: bridge-network
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/resourceName: bridge.network.kubevirt.io/br1
spec:
  config: |
    {
      "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
      "name": "bridge-network", 1
      "type": "bridge", 2
      "bridge": "br1", 3
      "preserveDefaultVlan": false,
      "vlan": 100,
      "disableContainerInterface": false,
      "portIsolation": true 4
    }
# ...
```

The name for the configuration. The name must match the value in the metadata.name of the NAD.
The actual name of the Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin that provides the network for this network attachment definition. Do not change this field unless you want to use a different CNI.
The name of the Linux bridge that is configured on the node. The name must match the interface bridge name defined in the NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy manifest.
Enables or disables port isolation on the virtual bridge. Default value is false. When set to true, each VM or pod is assigned to an isolated port. The virtual bridge prevents traffic from one isolated port from reaching another isolated port.
2. Apply the configuration:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f example-vm.yaml
```

3. Optional: If you edited a running virtual machine, you must restart it for the changes to take effect.

## Configuring a VM network interface by using the CLI

You can configure a virtual machine (VM) network interface for a bridge network by using the command line.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Shut down the virtual machine before editing the configuration. If you edit a running virtual machine, you must restart the virtual machine for the changes to take effect.

1. Add the bridge interface and the network attachment definition to the VM configuration as in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  name: example-vm
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      domain:
        devices:
          interfaces:
            - bridge: {}
              name: bridge-net 1
# ...
      networks:
        - name: bridge-net 2
          multus:
            networkName: bridge-network 3
```

The name of the bridge interface.
The name of the network. This value must match the name value of the corresponding spec.template.spec.domain.devices.interfaces entry.
The name of the network attachment definition.
2. Apply the configuration:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f example-vm.yaml
```

3. Optional: If you edited a running virtual machine, you must restart it for the changes to take effect.


[NOTE]
----
When running OpenShift Virtualization on IBM Z(R) using an OSA card, you must register the MAC address of the device. For more information, see OSA interface traffic forwarding (IBM documentation).
