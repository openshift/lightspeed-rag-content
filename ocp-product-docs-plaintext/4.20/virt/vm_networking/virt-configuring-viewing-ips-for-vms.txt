# Configuring and viewing IP addresses


You can configure an IP address when you create a virtual machine (VM). The IP address is provisioned with cloud-init.
You can view the IP address of a VM by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console or the command line. The network information is collected by the QEMU guest agent.

# Configuring IP addresses for virtual machines

You can configure a static IP address when you create a virtual machine (VM) by using the web console or the command line.

You can configure a dynamic IP address when you create a VM by using the command line.

The IP address is provisioned with cloud-init.

## Configuring a static IP address when creating a virtual machine by using the web console

You can configure a static IP address when you create a virtual machine (VM) by using the web console. The IP address is provisioned with cloud-init.


[NOTE]
----
If the VM is connected to the pod network, the pod network interface is the default route unless you update it.
----

* The virtual machine is connected to a secondary network.

1. Navigate to Virtualization -> Catalog in the web console.
2. Click a template tile.
3. Click Customize VirtualMachine.
4. Click Next.
5. On the Scripts tab, click the edit icon beside Cloud-init.
6. Select the Add network data checkbox.
7. Enter the ethernet name, one or more IP addresses separated by commas, and the gateway address.
8. Click Apply.
9. Click Create VirtualMachine.

## Configuring an IP address when creating a virtual machine by using the CLI

You can configure a static or dynamic IP address when you create a virtual machine (VM). The IP address is provisioned with cloud-init.


[NOTE]
----
If the VM is connected to the pod network, the pod network interface is the default route unless you update it.
----

* The virtual machine is connected to a secondary network.
* You have a DHCP server available on the secondary network to configure a dynamic IP for the virtual machine.

* Edit the spec.template.spec.volumes.cloudInitNoCloud.networkData stanza of the virtual machine configuration:
* To configure a dynamic IP address, specify the interface name and enable DHCP:

```yaml
kind: VirtualMachine
spec:
# ...
  template:
  # ...
    spec:
      volumes:
      - cloudInitNoCloud:
          networkData: |
            version: 2
            ethernets:
              eth1: 1
                dhcp4: true
```

Specify the interface name.
* To configure a static IP, specify the interface name and the IP address:

```yaml
kind: VirtualMachine
spec:
# ...
  template:
  # ...
    spec:
      volumes:
      - cloudInitNoCloud:
          networkData: |
            version: 2
            ethernets:
              eth1: 1
                addresses:
                - 10.10.10.14/24 2
```

Specify the interface name.
Specify the static IP address.

# Viewing IP addresses of virtual machines

You can view the IP address of a VM by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console or the command line.

The network information is collected by the QEMU guest agent.

## Viewing the IP address of a virtual machine by using the web console

You can view the IP address of a virtual machine (VM) by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.


[NOTE]
----
You must install the QEMU guest agent on a VM to view the IP address of a secondary network interface. A pod network interface does not require the QEMU guest agent.
----

1. In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform console, click Virtualization -> VirtualMachines from the side menu.
2. Select a VM to open the VirtualMachine details page.
3. Click the Details tab to view the IP address.

## Viewing the IP address of a virtual machine by using the CLI

You can view the IP address of a virtual machine (VM) by using the command line.


[NOTE]
----
You must install the QEMU guest agent on a VM to view the IP address of a secondary network interface. A pod network interface does not require the QEMU guest agent.
----

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* Obtain the virtual machine instance configuration by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc describe vmi <vmi_name>
```


Example output:
