# Uninstalling OpenShift Virtualization


You uninstall OpenShift Virtualization by using the web console or the command-line interface (CLI) to delete the OpenShift Virtualization workloads, the Operator, and its resources.

# Uninstalling OpenShift Virtualization by using the web console

You uninstall OpenShift Virtualization by using the web console to perform the following tasks:

1. Delete the HyperConverged CR.
2. Delete the OpenShift Virtualization Operator.
3. Delete the openshift-cnv namespace.
4. Delete the OpenShift Virtualization custom resource definitions (CRDs).


[IMPORTANT]
----
You must first delete all virtual machines, and virtual machine instances.
You cannot uninstall OpenShift Virtualization while its workloads remain on the cluster.
----

## Deleting the HyperConverged custom resource

To uninstall OpenShift Virtualization, you first delete the HyperConverged custom resource (CR).

* You have access to an {product-title} cluster using an account with cluster-admin permissions.

1. Navigate to the Operators -> Installed Operators page.
2. Select the OpenShift Virtualization Operator.
3. Click the OpenShift Virtualization Deployment tab.
4. Click the Options menu  beside kubevirt-hyperconverged and select Delete HyperConverged.
5. Click Delete in the confirmation window.

## Deleting Operators from a cluster using the web console

Cluster administrators can delete installed Operators from a selected namespace by using the web console.

* You have access to the {product-title} cluster web console using an account with

1. Navigate to the Operators â†’ Installed Operators page.
2. Scroll or enter a keyword into the Filter by name field to find the Operator that you want to remove. Then, click on it.
3. On the right side of the Operator Details page, select Uninstall Operator from the Actions list.

An Uninstall Operator? dialog box is displayed.
4. Select Uninstall to remove the Operator, Operator deployments, and pods. Following this action, the Operator stops running and no longer receives updates.

[NOTE]
----
This action does not remove resources managed by the Operator, including custom resource definitions (CRDs) and custom resources (CRs). Dashboards and navigation items enabled by the web console and off-cluster resources that continue to run might need manual clean up. To remove these after uninstalling the Operator, you might need to manually delete the Operator CRDs.

## Deleting a namespace using the web console

You can delete a namespace by using the {product-title} web console.

* You have access to the {product-title} cluster using an account with cluster-admin permissions.

1. Navigate to Administration -> Namespaces.
2. Locate the namespace that you want to delete in the list of namespaces.
3. On the far right side of the namespace listing, select Delete Namespace from the
Options menu .
4. When the Delete Namespace pane opens, enter the name of the namespace that
you want to delete in the field.
5. Click Delete.

## Deleting OpenShift Virtualization custom resource definitions

You can delete the OpenShift Virtualization custom resource definitions (CRDs) by using the web console.

* You have access to the {product-title} cluster using an account with cluster-admin permissions.

1. Navigate to Administration -> CustomResourceDefinitions.
2. Select the Label filter and enter operators.coreos.com/kubevirt-hyperconverged.openshift-cnv in the Search field to display the OpenShift Virtualization CRDs.
3. Click the Options menu  beside each CRD and select Delete CustomResourceDefinition.

# Uninstalling OpenShift Virtualization by using the CLI

You can uninstall OpenShift Virtualization by using the OpenShift CLI (oc).

* You have access to the {product-title} cluster using an account with cluster-admin permissions.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have deleted all virtual machines and virtual machine instances. You cannot uninstall OpenShift Virtualization while its workloads remain on the cluster.

1. Delete the HyperConverged custom resource:

```terminal
$ oc delete HyperConverged kubevirt-hyperconverged -n openshift-cnv
```

2. Delete the OpenShift Virtualization Operator subscription:

```terminal
$ oc delete subscription kubevirt-hyperconverged -n openshift-cnv
```

3. Delete the OpenShift Virtualization ClusterServiceVersion resource:

```terminal
$ oc delete csv -n openshift-cnv -l operators.coreos.com/kubevirt-hyperconverged.openshift-cnv
```

4. Delete the OpenShift Virtualization namespace:

```terminal
$ oc delete namespace openshift-cnv
```

5. List the OpenShift Virtualization custom resource definitions (CRDs) by running the oc delete crd command with the dry-run option:

```terminal
$ oc delete crd --dry-run=client -l operators.coreos.com/kubevirt-hyperconverged.openshift-cnv
```

Example output

```
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io "cdis.cdi.kubevirt.io" deleted (dry run)
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io "hostpathprovisioners.hostpathprovisioner.kubevirt.io" deleted (dry run)
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io "hyperconvergeds.hco.kubevirt.io" deleted (dry run)
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io "kubevirts.kubevirt.io" deleted (dry run)
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io "networkaddonsconfigs.networkaddonsoperator.network.kubevirt.io" deleted (dry run)
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io "ssps.ssp.kubevirt.io" deleted (dry run)
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io "tektontasks.tektontasks.kubevirt.io" deleted (dry run)
```

6. Delete the CRDs by running the oc delete crd command without the dry-run option:

```terminal
$ oc delete crd -l operators.coreos.com/kubevirt-hyperconverged.openshift-cnv
```
