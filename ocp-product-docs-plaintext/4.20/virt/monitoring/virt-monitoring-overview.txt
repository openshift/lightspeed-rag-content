# Monitoring overview



You can monitor the health of your cluster and virtual machines (VMs) with the following tools:

Monitoring OpenShift Virtualization VM health status:: View the overall health of your OpenShift Virtualization environment in the web console by navigating to the Home -> Overview page in the {product-title} web console. The Status card displays the overall health of OpenShift Virtualization based on the alerts and conditions.
{product-title} cluster checkup framework:: Run automated tests on your cluster with the {product-title} cluster checkup framework to check the following conditions:
* Network connectivity and latency between two VMs attached to a secondary network interface
* VM running a Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) workload with zero packet loss
* Cluster storage is optimally configured for OpenShift Virtualization

Prometheus queries for virtual resources:: Query vCPU, network, storage, and guest memory swapping usage and live migration progress.
VM custom metrics:: Configure the node-exporter service to expose internal VM metrics and processes.
VM health checks:: Configure readiness, liveness, and guest agent ping probes and a watchdog for VMs.
Runbooks:: Diagnose and resolve issues that trigger OpenShift Virtualization alerts in the {product-title} web console.
