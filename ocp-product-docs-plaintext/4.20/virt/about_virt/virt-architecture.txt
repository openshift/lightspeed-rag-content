# OpenShift Virtualization Architecture


The Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) deploys operator pods for each component of OpenShift Virtualization:
* Compute: virt-operator
* Storage: cdi-operator
* Network: cluster-network-addons-operator
* Scaling: ssp-operator
OLM also deploys the hyperconverged-cluster-operator pod, which is responsible for the deployment, configuration, and life cycle of other components, and several helper pods: hco-webhook, and hyperconverged-cluster-cli-download.
After all operator pods are successfully deployed, you should create the HyperConverged custom resource (CR). The configurations set in the HyperConverged CR serve as the single source of truth and the entrypoint for OpenShift Virtualization, and guide the behavior of the CRs.
The HyperConverged CR creates corresponding CRs for the operators of all other components within its reconciliation loop. Each operator then creates resources such as daemon sets, config maps, and additional components for the OpenShift Virtualization control plane. For example, when the HyperConverged Operator (HCO) creates the KubeVirt CR, the OpenShift Virtualization Operator reconciles it and creates additional resources such as virt-controller, virt-handler, and virt-api.
The OLM deploys the Hostpath Provisioner (HPP) Operator, but it is not functional until you create a hostpath-provisioner CR.

# About the HyperConverged Operator (HCO)

The HCO, hco-operator, provides a single entry point for deploying and managing OpenShift Virtualization and several helper operators with opinionated defaults. It also creates custom resources (CRs) for those operators.

# About the Containerized Data Importer (CDI) Operator

The CDI Operator, cdi-operator, manages CDI and its related resources, which imports a virtual machine (VM) image into a persistent volume claim (PVC) by using a data volume.

# About the Cluster Network Addons Operator

The Cluster Network Addons Operator, cluster-network-addons-operator, deploys networking components on a cluster and manages the related resources for extended network functionality.

# About the Hostpath Provisioner (HPP) Operator

The HPP Operator, hostpath-provisioner-operator, deploys and manages the multi-node HPP and related resources.

# About the Scheduling, Scale, and Performance (SSP) Operator

The SSP Operator, ssp-operator, deploys the common templates, the related default boot sources, the pipeline tasks, and the template validator.

# About the OpenShift Virtualization Operator

The OpenShift Virtualization Operator, virt-operator, deploys, upgrades, and manages OpenShift Virtualization without disrupting current virtual machine (VM) workloads. In addition, the OpenShift Virtualization Operator deploys the common instance types and common preferences.
