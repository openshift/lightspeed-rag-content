# About OpenShift Virtualization


Learn about OpenShift Virtualization's capabilities and support scope.

# What you can do with OpenShift Virtualization

OpenShift Virtualization provides the scalable, enterprise-grade virtualization functionality in Red&#160;Hat OpenShift.
You can use it to manage virtual machines (VMs) exclusively or alongside container workloads.


[NOTE]
----
If you have a Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization Engine subscription, you can run unlimited VMs on subscribed hosts, but you cannot run application instances in containers. For more information, see the subscription guide section about Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization Engine and related products.
----

OpenShift Virtualization adds new objects into your {product-title} cluster by using Kubernetes custom resources to enable virtualization tasks. These tasks include:

* Creating and managing Linux and Windows VMs
* Running pod and VM workloads alongside each other in a cluster
* Connecting to VMs through a variety of consoles and CLI tools
* Importing and cloning existing VMs
* Managing network interface controllers and storage disks attached to VMs
* Live migrating VMs between nodes

You can manage your cluster and virtualization resources by using the Virtualization perspective of the {product-title} web console, and by using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

OpenShift Virtualization is designed and tested to work well with Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation features.


[IMPORTANT]
----
When you deploy OpenShift Virtualization with OpenShift Data Foundation, you must create a dedicated storage class for Windows virtual machine disks. See Optimizing ODF PersistentVolumes for Windows VMs for details.
----

You can use OpenShift Virtualization with OVN-Kubernetes or one of the other certified network plugins listed in Certified OpenShift CNI Plug-ins.

You can check your OpenShift Virtualization cluster for compliance issues by installing the Compliance Operator and running a scan with the ocp4-moderate and ocp4-moderate-node profiles. The Compliance Operator uses OpenSCAP, a NIST-certified tool, to scan and enforce security policies.

For information about partnering with Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) and Services partners for specialized storage, networking, backup, and additional functionality, see the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog.

# Comparing OpenShift Virtualization to VMware vSphere

If you are familiar with VMware vSphere, the following table lists OpenShift Virtualization components that you can use to accomplish similar tasks. However, because OpenShift Virtualization is conceptually different from vSphere, and much of its functionality comes from the underlying {product-title}, OpenShift Virtualization does not have direct alternatives for all vSphere concepts or components.



# Supported cluster versions for OpenShift Virtualization

The latest stable release of OpenShift Virtualization 4.19 is 4.19.0.

OpenShift Virtualization 4.19 is supported for use on {product-title} {product-version} clusters. To use the latest z-stream release of OpenShift Virtualization, you must first upgrade to the latest version of {product-title}.

# About volume and access modes for virtual machine disks

If you use the storage API with known storage providers, the volume and access modes are selected automatically. However, if you use a storage class that does not have a storage profile, you must configure the volume and access mode.

For a list of known storage providers for OpenShift Virtualization, see the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog.

For best results, use the ReadWriteMany (RWX) access mode and the Block volume mode. This is important for the following reasons:

* ReadWriteMany (RWX) access mode is required for live migration.
* The Block volume mode performs significantly better than the Filesystem volume mode. This is because the Filesystem volume mode uses more storage layers, including a file system layer and a disk image file. These layers are not necessary for VM disk storage.

For example, if you use Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation, Ceph RBD volumes are preferable to CephFS volumes.


[IMPORTANT]
----
You cannot live migrate virtual machines with the following configurations:
* Storage volume with ReadWriteOnce (RWO) access mode
* Passthrough features such as GPUs
Set the evictionStrategy field to None for these virtual machines.
The None strategy powers down VMs during node reboots.

# Single-node OpenShift differences

You can install OpenShift Virtualization on single-node OpenShift.

However, you should be aware that Single-node OpenShift does not support the following features:

* High availability
* Pod disruption
* Live migration
* Virtual machines or templates that have an eviction strategy configured
