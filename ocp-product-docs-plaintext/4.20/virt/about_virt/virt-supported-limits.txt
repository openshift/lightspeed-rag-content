# Supported limits


You can refer to tested object maximums when planning your {product-title} environment for OpenShift Virtualization. However, approaching the maximum values can reduce performance and increase latency. Ensure that you plan for your specific use case and consider all factors that can impact cluster scaling.
For more information about cluster configuration and options that impact performance, see the OpenShift Virtualization - Tuning & Scaling Guide in the Red Hat Knowledgebase.

# Tested maximums for OpenShift Virtualization

The following limits apply to a large-scale OpenShift Virtualization 4.x environment. They are based on a single cluster of the largest possible size. When you plan an environment, remember that multiple smaller clusters might be the best option for your use case.

## Virtual machine maximums

The following maximums apply to virtual machines (VMs) running on OpenShift Virtualization. These values are subject to the limits specified in Virtualization limits for Red Hat Enterprise Linux with KVM.




[NOTE]
----
Each VM must have at least 512 MB of memory.

## Host maximums

The following maximums apply to the {product-title} hosts used for OpenShift Virtualization.



## Cluster maximums

The following maximums apply to objects defined in OpenShift Virtualization.



1. If you use more than 100 nodes, consider using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) to manage multiple clusters instead of scaling out a single control plane. Larger clusters add complexity, require longer updates, and depending on node size and total object density, they can increase control plane stress.

Using multiple clusters can be beneficial in areas like per-cluster isolation and high availability.
2. The maximum number of VMs per node depends on the host hardware and resource capacity. It is also limited by the following parameters:
* Settings that limit the number of pods that can be scheduled to a node. For example: maxPods.
* The default number of KVM devices. For example: devices.kubevirt.io/kvm: 1k.
