# Editing boot order


You can update the values for a boot order list by using the web console or the CLI.
With Boot Order in the Virtual Machine Overview page, you can:
* Select a disk or network interface controller (NIC) and add it to the boot order list.
* Edit the order of the disks or NICs in the boot order list.
* Remove a disk or NIC from the boot order list, and return it back to the inventory of bootable sources.

# Adding items to a boot order list in the web console

Add items to a boot order list by using the web console.

1. Click Virtualization -> VirtualMachines from the side menu.
2. Select a virtual machine to open the VirtualMachine details page.
3. Click the Details tab.
4. Click the pencil icon that is located on the right side of Boot Order. If a YAML configuration does not exist, or if this is the first time that you are creating a boot order list, the following message displays: No resource selected.

# Editing a boot order list in the YAML configuration file

Edit the boot order list in a YAML configuration file by using the CLI.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

1. Open the YAML configuration file for the virtual machine by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc edit vm <vm_name> -n <namespace>
```

2. Edit the YAML file and modify the values for the boot order associated with a disk or network interface controller (NIC). For example:

```yaml
disks:
  - bootOrder: 1 1
    disk:
      bus: virtio
    name: containerdisk
  - disk:
      bus: virtio
    name: cloudinitdisk
  - cdrom:
      bus: virtio
    name: cd-drive-1
interfaces:
  - boot Order: 2 2
    macAddress: '02:96:c4:00:00'
    masquerade: {}
    name: default
```

The boot order value specified for the disk.
The boot order value specified for the network interface controller.
3. Save the YAML file.

# Removing items from a boot order list in the web console

Remove items from a boot order list by using the web console.

1. Click Virtualization -> VirtualMachines from the side menu.
2. Select a virtual machine to open the VirtualMachine details page.

4. Click the pencil icon that is located on the right side of Boot Order.
5. Click the Remove icon Delete next to the item. The item is removed from the boot order list and saved in the list of available boot sources. If you remove all items from the boot order list, the following message displays: No resource selected. VM will attempt to boot from disks by order of appearance in YAML file.
