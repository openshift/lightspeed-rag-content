# Controlling virtual machine states


You can use virtctl to manage virtual machine states and perform other actions from the CLI. For example, you can use virtctl to force stop a VM or expose a port.
You can stop, start, restart, pause, and unpause virtual machines from the web console.

# Configuring RBAC permissions for managing VM states by using the web console

To allow users to manage virtual machine (VM) states by using the {product-title} web console, you must create an RBAC cluster role and cluster role binding.
The cluster role uses the subresources.kubevirt.io API to define which resources can be controlled by certain users or groups.

* You have cluster administrator access to an {product-title} cluster where OpenShift Virtualization is installed.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

1. Create a ClusterRole object that allows the target user or group to manage VM states:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: vm-manager-access
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - subresources.kubevirt.io
    resources:
      - virtualmachines/start
      - virtualmachines/stop
    verbs:
      - put
# ...
```

2. Run the following command to apply the cluster role:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
```

3. Confirm that the cluster role was created by running the following command and observing the output:

```terminal
$ oc get clusterrole <name>
```


Example output:

```terminal
NAME                AGE
vm-manager-access   15s
```

4. Inspect the details of the cluster role, and ensure the intended rules for subresources.kubevirt.io are present, specifically the virtualmachines/start and virtualmachines/stop subresources.

Run the following command and observe the output:

```terminal
$ oc describe clusterrole <name>
```


Example output:

```terminal
Name:         vm-manager-access
Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  <none>
PolicyRule:
  Resources  Non-Resource URLs  Resource Names  Verbs
  ---------  -----------------  --------------  -----
  virtualmachines/start, virtualmachines/stop with subresources.kubevirt.io group  []  []  [put]
```

5. Create a ClusterRoleBinding object to bind the cluster role you have created to the target user or group:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: vm-manager-access-binding
subjects:
  - kind: User
    name: test-user
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: vm-manager-access
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

6. Run the following command to apply the cluster role binding:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
```

7. Confirm that the cluster role binding was created by running the following command and observing the output:

```terminal
$ oc get clusterrolebinding <name>
```


Example output:

```terminal
NAME                        AGE
vm-manager-access-binding   15s
```


1. Check if the user can start a VM by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc auth can-i update virtualmachines/start --namespace=<namespace> --as=<user_name> --subresource=subresources.kubevirt.io
```


Example output:

```terminal
yes
```

2. Check if the user can stop a VM by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc auth can-i update virtualmachines/stop --namespace=<namespace> --as=<user_name> --group=subresources.kubevirt.io
```


Example output:

```terminal
yes
```


# Enabling confirmations of virtual machine actions

The Stop, Restart, and Pause actions can display confirmation dialogs if confirmation is enabled. By default, confirmation is disabled.

1. In the Virtualization section of the {product-title} web console, navigate to Overview -> Settings -> Cluster -> General settings.
2. Toggle the VirtualMachine actions confirmation setting to On.

# Starting a virtual machine

You can start a virtual machine (VM) from the web console.

1. Click Virtualization -> VirtualMachines from the side menu.
2. In the tree view, select the project that contains the VM that you want to start.
3. Navigate to the appropriate menu for your use case:

2. Click Actions -> Start.


[NOTE]
----
When you start VM that is provisioned from a URL source for the first time, the VM has a status of Importing while OpenShift Virtualization imports the container from the URL endpoint. Depending on the size of the image, this process might take several minutes.
