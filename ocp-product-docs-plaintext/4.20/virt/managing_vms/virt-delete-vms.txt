# Deleting virtual machines


You can delete a virtual machine by using the web console or the oc command line interface.

# Deleting a virtual machine using the web console

Deleting a virtual machine (VM) permanently removes it from the cluster.

If the VM is delete protected, the Delete action is disabled in the VM&#8217;s Actions menu.

* You have disabled the VM's delete protection setting.
* You have stopped the VM.

1. From the {product-title} web console, choose your view:
* For a virtualization-focused view, select Administrator → Virtualization → VirtualMachines.
* For a general view, navigate to Virtualization → VirtualMachines.
2. Click the Options menu  beside a VM and select Delete.

Alternatively, click the VM&#8217;s name to open the VirtualMachine details page and click Actions &#8594; Delete.

You can also right-click the VM in the tree view and select Delete from the pop-up menu.
3. Optional: Select With grace period or clear Delete disks.
4. Click Delete to permanently delete the VM.

# Deleting a virtual machine by using the CLI

You can delete a virtual machine (VM) by using the oc command-line interface (CLI). The oc client enables you to perform actions on multiple VMs.

* You have disabled the VM's delete protection setting.
* You have stopped the VM.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* Delete the VM by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete vm <vm_name>
```


[NOTE]
----
This command only deletes a VM in the current project. Specify the
-n <project_name> option if the VM you want to delete is in
a different project or namespace.
