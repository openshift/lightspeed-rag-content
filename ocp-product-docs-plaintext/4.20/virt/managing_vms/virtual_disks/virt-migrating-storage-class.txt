# Migrating VM disks to a different storage class


You can migrate one or more virtual disks to a different storage class without stopping your virtual machine (VM) or virtual machine instance (VMI).

# Migrating VM disks to a different storage class by using the web console

You can migrate one or more disks attached to a virtual machine (VM) to a different storage class by using the {product-title} web console. When performing this action on a running VM, the operation of the VM is not interrupted and the data on the migrated disks remains accessible.


[NOTE]
----
With the OpenShift Virtualization Operator, you can only start storage class migration for one VM at the time and the VM must be running. If you need to migrate more VMs at once or migrate a mix of running and stopped VMs, consider using the Migration Toolkit for Containers (MTC).
Migration Toolkit for Containers is not part of OpenShift Virtualization and requires separate installation.

* You must have a data volume or a persistent volume claim (PVC) available for storage class migration.
* The cluster must have a node available for live migration. As part of the storage class migration, the VM is live migrated to a different node.
* The VM must be running.

1. Navigate to Virtualization -> VirtualMachines in the web console.
2. Click the Options menu  beside the virtual machine and select Migration -> Storage.

You can also access this option from the VirtualMachine details page by selecting Actions &#8594; Migration &#8594; Storage.

Alternatively, right-click the VM in the tree view and select Migration from the pop-up menu.
3. On the Migration details page, choose whether to migrate the entire VM storage or selected volumes only. If you click Selected volumes, select any disks that you intend to migrate. Click Next to proceed.
4. From the list of available options on the Destination StorageClass page, select the storage class to migrate to. Click Next to proceed.
5. On the Review page, review the list of affected disks and the target storage class. To start the migration, click Migrate VirtualMachine storage.
6. Stay on the Migrate VirtualMachine storage page to watch the progress and wait for the confirmation that the migration completed successfully.

1. From the VirtualMachine details page, navigate to Configuration -> Storage.
2. Verify that all disks have the expected storage class listed in the Storage class column.
