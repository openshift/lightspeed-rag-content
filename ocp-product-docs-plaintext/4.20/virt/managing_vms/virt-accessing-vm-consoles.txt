# Connecting to virtual machine consoles


You can connect to the following consoles to access running virtual machines (VMs):
* VNC console
* Serial console
* Desktop viewer for Windows VMs

# Considerations for accessing VM consoles

In the OpenShift Virtualization environment, you can access guest VMs without the need for a guest network by using the {product-title} web console or by using virtctl commands from the command-line interface (CLI).


[NOTE]
----
Connecting to a guest VM through the VNC or serial console does not provide a full set of access features and cannot replace the Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) access. However, these consoles are useful for troubleshooting, as they allow access even if the guest VM has no network.
----

* Connecting to VMs using the VNC console

You can connect to the VNC console of a VM by using the {product-title} web console, as documented in the first two steps in Connecting to the VNC console by using the web console.

Alternatively, you can use the virtctl command-line tool to connect to the VNC console of a running VM. The installation of the virtctl command line tool is documented in Installing virtctl, and the usage is documented in Connecting to the VNC console by using virtctl.

Take into account the following considerations:
* Using the VNC console is recommended for troubleshooting VMs.
* Using the VNC console is not recommended for high-traffic applications, such as Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI), because of the burden on the API server.
* The API server must be able to handle the traffic load.
* The clients must be able to access the API server.
* The clients must have access credentials for the cluster.
* The VNC connection is expected to disconnect during live migration of a VM to another node.
* Using the VNC console allows only a single connection per VM at a time.
* Connecting to VMs using the serial console

You can connect to the serial console of a virtual machine (VM) by using the {product-title} web console, as documented in Connecting to the serial console by using the web console.

Alternatively, you can use the virtctl command-line tool to connect to the serial console of a running virtual machine. The installation of the virtctl command line tool is documented in Installing virtctl, and the usage is documented in Connecting to the serial console by using virtctl.

Take into account the following considerations:
* The clients must be able to access the API server.
* The clients must have access credentials for the cluster.
* The API server must be able to handle the traffic load.
* The serial connection is expected to disconnect during live migration of a VM to another node.
* Using the serial console allows only a single connection per VM at a time.

# Connecting to the VNC console

You can connect to the VNC console of a virtual machine by using the {product-title} web console or the virtctl command-line tool.

## Connecting to the VNC console by using the web console

You can connect to the {console} of a virtual machine (VM) by using the {product-title} web console.


[NOTE]
----
If you connect to a Windows VM with a vGPU assigned as a mediated device, you can switch between the default display and the vGPU display.
----

1. On the Virtualization -> VirtualMachines page, click a VM to open the VirtualMachine details page.
2. Click the Console tab. The VNC console session starts automatically.
3. Optional: To switch to the vGPU display of a Windows VM, select Ctl + Alt + 2 from the Send key list.
* Select Ctl + Alt + 1 from the Send key list to restore the default display.
4. To end the console session, click outside the console pane and then click Disconnect.

## Connecting to the VNC console by using virtctl

You can use the virtctl command-line tool to connect to the {console} of a running virtual machine.


[NOTE]
----
If you run the virtctl vnc command on a remote machine over an SSH connection, you must forward the X session to your local machine by running the ssh command with the -X or -Y flags.
----

* You must install the virt-viewer package.

1. Run the following command to start the console session:

+


```
$ virtctl vnc <vm_name>
```


1. If the connection fails, run the following command to collect
troubleshooting information:

```terminal
$ virtctl vnc <vm_name> -v 4
```


## Generating a temporary token for the VNC console

To access the VNC of a virtual machine (VM), generate a temporary authentication bearer token for the Kubernetes API.


[NOTE]
----
Kubernetes also supports authentication using client certificates, instead of a bearer token, by modifying the curl command.
----

* A running VM with OpenShift Virtualization 4.14 or later and ssp-operator 4.14 or later.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

1. Set the deployVmConsoleProxy field value in the HyperConverged (HCO) custom resource (CR) to true:

```terminal
$ oc patch hyperconverged kubevirt-hyperconverged -n openshift-cnv --type json -p '[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/deployVmConsoleProxy", "value": true}]'
```

2. Generate a token by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ curl --header "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
     "https://api.<cluster_fqdn>/apis/token.kubevirt.io/v1alpha1/namespaces/<namespace>/virtualmachines/<vm_name>/vnc?duration=<duration>"
```


The <duration> parameter can be set in hours and minutes, with a minimum duration of 10 minutes. For example: 5h30m. If this parameter is not set, the token is valid for 10 minutes by default.

Sample output:

```terminal
{ "token": "eyJhb..." }
```

3. Optional: Use the token provided in the output to create a variable:

```terminal
$ export VNC_TOKEN="<token>"
```


You can now use the token to access the VNC console of a VM.

1. Log in to the cluster by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc login --token ${VNC_TOKEN}
```

2. Test access to the VNC console of the VM by using the virtctl command:

```terminal
$ virtctl vnc <vm_name> -n <namespace>
```



[WARNING]
----
It is currently not possible to revoke a specific token.
To revoke a token, you must delete the service account that was used to create it. However, this also revokes all other tokens that were created by using the service account. Use the following command with caution:

```terminal
$ virtctl delete serviceaccount --namespace "<namespace>" "<vm_name>-vnc-access"
```

### Granting token generation permission for the VNC console by using the cluster role

As a cluster administrator, you can install a cluster role and bind it to a user or service account to allow access to the endpoint that generates tokens for the VNC console.

* Choose to bind the cluster role to either a user or service account.
* Run the following command to bind the cluster role to a user:

```terminal
$ kubectl create rolebinding "${ROLE_BINDING_NAME}" --clusterrole="token.kubevirt.io:generate" --user="${USER_NAME}"
```

* Run the following command to bind the cluster role to a service account:

```terminal
$ kubectl create rolebinding "${ROLE_BINDING_NAME}" --clusterrole="token.kubevirt.io:generate" --serviceaccount="${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME}"
```
