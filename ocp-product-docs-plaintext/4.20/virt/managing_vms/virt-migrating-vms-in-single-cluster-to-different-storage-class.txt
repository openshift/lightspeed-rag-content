# Migrating VMs in a single cluster to a different storage class by using the web console

By using the {product-title} web console, you can migrate single-cluster VMs in bulk from one storage class to another storage class.

The Migrate VirtualMachine storage page opens.
4. To review the VMs that you want to migrate, click the link that identifies the number of VMs and volumes. Click View more to see the full list.
