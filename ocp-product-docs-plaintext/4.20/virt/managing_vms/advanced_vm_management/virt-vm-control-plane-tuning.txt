# Virtual machine control plane tuning


OpenShift Virtualization offers the following tuning options at the control-plane level:
* The highBurst profile, which uses fixed QPS and burst rates, to create hundreds of virtual machines (VMs) in one batch
* Migration setting adjustment based on workload type

# Configuring a highBurst profile

Use the highBurst profile to create and maintain a large number of virtual machines (VMs) in one cluster.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* Apply the following patch to enable the highBurst tuning policy profile:

```terminal
$ oc patch hyperconverged kubevirt-hyperconverged -n openshift-cnv \
  --type=json -p='[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/tuningPolicy", \
  "value": "highBurst"}]'
```


* Run the following command to verify the highBurst tuning policy profile is enabled:

```terminal
$ oc get kubevirt.kubevirt.io/kubevirt-kubevirt-hyperconverged \
  -n openshift-cnv -o go-template --template='{{range $config, \
  $value := .spec.configuration}} {{if eq $config "apiConfiguration" \
  "webhookConfiguration" "controllerConfiguration" "handlerConfiguration"}} \
  {{"\n"}} {{$config}} = {{$value}} {{end}} {{end}} {{"\n"}}
```
