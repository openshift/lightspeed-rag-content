# Managing virtual machines by using OpenShift GitOps

To automate and optimize virtual machine (VM) management in OpenShift Virtualization, you can use OpenShift GitOps.

With GitOps, you can set up VM deployments based on configuration files stored in a Git repository. This also makes it easier to automate, update, or replicate these configurations, as well to use version control for tracking their changes.

* You have a GitHub account. For instructions to set up an account, see Creating an account on GitHub.
* OpenShift Virtualuzation has been installed on your OpenShift cluster. For instructions, see OpenShift Virtualization installation.
* The OpenShift GitOps operator has been installed on your OpenShift cluster. For instructions, see Installing GitOps.

Follow the Manage OpenShift virtual machines with GitOps learning path in performing these steps:

1. Connect an external Git repository to your Argo CD instance.
2. Create the required VM configuration in the Git repository.
3. Use the VM configuration to create VMs on your cluster.
