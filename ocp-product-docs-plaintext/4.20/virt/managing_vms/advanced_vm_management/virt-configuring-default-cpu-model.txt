# Configuring the default CPU model

Use the defaultCPUModel setting in the HyperConverged custom resource (CR) to define a cluster-wide default CPU model.
The virtual machine (VM) CPU model depends on the availability of CPU models within the VM and the cluster.
* If the VM does not have a defined CPU model:
* The defaultCPUModel is automatically set using the CPU model defined at the cluster-wide level.
* If both the VM and the cluster have a defined CPU model:
* The VMâ€™s CPU model takes precedence.
* If neither the VM nor the cluster have a defined CPU model:
* The host-model is automatically set using the CPU model defined at the host level.

# Configuring the default CPU model

Configure the defaultCPUModel by updating the HyperConverged custom resource (CR). You can change the defaultCPUModel while OpenShift Virtualization is running.


[NOTE]
----
The defaultCPUModel is case sensitive.

* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Open the HyperConverged CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc edit hyperconverged kubevirt-hyperconverged -n openshift-cnv
```

2. Add the defaultCPUModel field to the CR and set the value to the name of a CPU model that exists in the cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: hco.kubevirt.io/v1beta1
kind: HyperConverged
metadata:
 name: kubevirt-hyperconverged
 namespace: openshift-cnv
spec:
  defaultCPUModel: "EPYC"
```

3. Apply the YAML file to your cluster.
