# Listing virtual machines


You can list available virtual machines (VMs) by using the web console or the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

# Listing virtual machines by using the CLI

You can either list all of the virtual machines (VMs) in your cluster or limit the list to VMs in a specified namespace by using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* List all of the VMs in your cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get vms -A
```

* List all of the VMs in a specific namespace by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get vms -n <namespace>
```


# Listing virtual machines by using the web console

You can list all of the virtual machines (VMs) in your cluster by using the web console.

1. Click Virtualization -> VirtualMachines from the side menu to access the tree view with all of the projects and VMs in your cluster.
2. Optional: Enable the Show only projects with VirtualMachines option above the tree view to limit the displayed projects.
3. Optional: Click the Advanced search button next to the search bar to further filter VMs by one of the following: their name, the project they belong to, their labels, or the allocated vCPU and memory resources.

# Organizing virtual machines by using the web console

In addition to creating virtual machines (VMs) in different projects, you can use the tree view to further organize them in folders.

1. Click Virtualization -> VirtualMachines from the side menu to access the tree view with all projects and VMs in your cluster.
2. Perform one of the following actions depending on your use case:
* To move the VM to a new folder in the same project:
1. Right-click the name of the VM in the tree view.
2. Select Move to folder from the menu.
3. Type the name of the folder to create in the "Search folder" bar.
4. Click Create folder in the drop-down list.
5. Click Save.
* To move the VM to an existing folder in the same project:
* Click the name of the VM in the tree view and drag it to a folder in the same project. If the operation is permitted, the folder is highlighted in green when you drag the VM over it.
* To move the VM from a folder to the project:
* Click the name of the VM in the tree view and drag it on the project name. If the operation is permitted, the project name is highlighted in green when you drag the VM over it.
