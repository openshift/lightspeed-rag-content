# Using virtual Trusted Platform Module devices


Add a virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) device to a new or existing virtual
machine by editing the VirtualMachine (VM) or VirtualMachineInstance (VMI)
manifest.

[IMPORTANT]
----
With OpenShift Virtualization 4.18 and newer, you can export virtual machines (VMs) with attached vTPM devices, create snapshots of these VMs, and restore VMs from these snapshots. However, cloning a VM with a vTPM device attached to it or creating a new VM from its snapshot is not supported.

# About vTPM devices

A virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) device functions like a
physical Trusted Platform Module (TPM) hardware chip.
You can use a vTPM device with any operating system, but Windows 11 requires
the presence of a TPM chip to install or boot. A vTPM device allows VMs created
from a Windows 11 image to function without a physical TPM chip.

OpenShift Virtualization supports persisting vTPM device state by using Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) for VMs. If you do not specify the storage class for this PVC, OpenShift Virtualization uses the default storage class for virtualization workloads. If the default storage class for virtualization workloads is not set, OpenShift Virtualization uses the default storage class for the cluster.


[NOTE]
----
The storage class that is marked as default for virtualization workloads has the annotation storageclass.kubevirt.io/is-default-virt-class set to "true". You can find this storage class by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get sc -o jsonpath='{range .items[?(.metadata.annotations.storageclass\.kubevirt\.io/is-default-virt-class=="true")]}{.metadata.name}{"\n"}{end}'
```

Similarly, the default storage class for the cluster has the annotation storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class set to "true". To find this storage class, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get sc -o jsonpath='{range .items[?(.metadata.annotations.storageclass\.kubernetes\.io/is-default-class=="true")]}{.metadata.name}{"\n"}{end}'
```

To ensure consistent behavior, configure only one storage class as the default for virtualization workloads and for the cluster respectively.
----

It is recommended that you specify the storage class explicitly by setting the vmStateStorageClass attribute in the HyperConverged custom resource (CR):


```yaml
kind: HyperConverged
metadata:
  name: kubevirt-hyperconverged
spec:
  vmStateStorageClass: <storage_class_name>

# ...
```


If you do not enable vTPM, then the VM does not recognize a TPM device, even if
the node has one.

# Adding a vTPM device to a virtual machine

Adding a virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) device to a virtual machine
(VM) allows you to run a VM created from a Windows 11 image without a physical
TPM device. A vTPM device also stores secrets for that VM.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Run the following command to update the VM configuration:

```terminal
$ oc edit vm <vm_name> -n <namespace>
```

2. Edit the VM specification to add the vTPM device. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
    name: example-vm
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      domain:
        devices:
          tpm:  1
            persistent: true 2
# ...
```

Adds the vTPM device to the VM.
Specifies that the vTPM device state persists after the VM is shut down. The default value is false.
3. To apply your changes, save and exit the editor.
4. Optional: If you edited a running virtual machine, you must restart it for
the changes to take effect.
