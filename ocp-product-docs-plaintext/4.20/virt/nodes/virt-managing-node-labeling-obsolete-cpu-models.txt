# Managing node labeling for obsolete CPU models


You can schedule a virtual machine (VM) on a node as long as the VM CPU model and policy are supported by the node.

# About node labeling for obsolete CPU models

The OpenShift Virtualization Operator uses a predefined list of obsolete CPU models to ensure that a node supports only valid CPU models for scheduled VMs.

By default, the following CPU models are eliminated from the list of labels generated for the node:


```
"486"
Conroe
athlon
core2duo
coreduo
kvm32
kvm64
n270
pentium
pentium2
pentium3
pentiumpro
phenom
qemu32
qemu64
```

This predefined list is not visible in the HyperConverged CR. You cannot remove CPU models from this list, but you can add to the list by editing the spec.obsoleteCPUs.cpuModels field of the HyperConverged CR.

# Configuring obsolete CPU models

You can configure a list of obsolete CPU models by editing the HyperConverged custom resource (CR).

* Edit the HyperConverged custom resource, specifying the obsolete CPU models in the obsoleteCPUs array. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: hco.kubevirt.io/v1beta1
kind: HyperConverged
metadata:
  name: kubevirt-hyperconverged
  namespace: openshift-cnv
spec:
  obsoleteCPUs:
    cpuModels: 1
      - "<obsolete_cpu_1>"
      - "<obsolete_cpu_2>"
```

Replace the example values in the cpuModels array with obsolete CPU models. Any value that you specify is added to a predefined list of obsolete CPU models. The predefined list is not visible in the CR.
