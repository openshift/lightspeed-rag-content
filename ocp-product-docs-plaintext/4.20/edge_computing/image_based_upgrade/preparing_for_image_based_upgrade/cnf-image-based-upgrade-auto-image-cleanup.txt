# Configuring the automatic image cleanup of the container storage disk


Configure when the Lifecycle Agent cleans up unpinned images in the Prep stage by setting a minimum threshold for available storage space through annotations.
The default container storage disk usage threshold is 50%.
The Lifecycle Agent does not delete images that are pinned in CRI-O or are currently used.
The Operator selects the images for deletion by starting with dangling images and then sorting the images from oldest to newest that is determined by the image Created timestamp.

# Configuring the automatic image cleanup of the container storage disk

Configure the minimum threshold for available storage space through annotations.

* You have created an ImageBasedUpgrade CR.

1. Increase the threshold to 65% by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-lifecycle-agent annotate ibu upgrade image-cleanup.lca.openshift.io/disk-usage-threshold-percent='65'
```

2. (Optional) Remove the threshold override by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n  openshift-lifecycle-agent annotate ibu upgrade image-cleanup.lca.openshift.io/disk-usage-threshold-percent-
```


# Disable the automatic image cleanup of the container storage disk

Disable the automatic image cleanup threshold.

1. Disable the automatic image cleanup by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-lifecycle-agent annotate ibu upgrade image-cleanup.lca.openshift.io/on-prep='Disabled'
```

2. (Optional) Enable automatic image cleanup again by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n  openshift-lifecycle-agent annotate ibu upgrade image-cleanup.lca.openshift.io/on-prep-
```
