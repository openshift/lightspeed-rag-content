# Installing managed clusters with RHACM and SiteConfig resources


You can provision {product-title} clusters at scale with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) using the assisted service and the GitOps plugin policy generator with core-reduction technology enabled. The GitOps Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) pipeline performs the cluster installations. GitOps ZTP can be used in a disconnected environment.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Using PolicyGenTemplate CRs to manage and deploy policies to managed clusters will be deprecated in an upcoming {product-title} release.
Equivalent and improved functionality is available using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) and PolicyGenerator CRs.
For more information about PolicyGenerator resources, see the RHACM Integrating Policy Generator documentation.

# GitOps ZTP and Topology Aware Lifecycle Manager

GitOps Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) generates installation and configuration CRs from manifests stored in Git. These artifacts are applied to a centralized hub cluster where Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM), the assisted service, and the Topology Aware Lifecycle Manager (TALM) use the CRs to install and configure the managed cluster. The configuration phase of the GitOps ZTP pipeline uses the TALM to orchestrate the application of the configuration CRs to the cluster. There are several key integration points between GitOps ZTP and the TALM.

Inform policies:: By default, GitOps ZTP creates all policies with a remediation action of inform. These policies cause RHACM to report on compliance status of clusters relevant to the policies but does not apply the desired configuration. During the GitOps ZTP process, after OpenShift installation, the TALM steps through the created inform policies and enforces them on the target managed cluster(s). This applies the configuration to the managed cluster. Outside of the GitOps ZTP phase of the cluster lifecycle, this allows you to change policies without the risk of immediately rolling those changes out to affected managed clusters. You can control the timing and the set of remediated clusters by using TALM.
Automatic creation of ClusterGroupUpgrade CRs:: To automate the initial configuration of newly deployed clusters, TALM monitors the state of all ManagedCluster CRs on the hub cluster. Any ManagedCluster CR that does not have a ztp-done label applied, including newly created ManagedCluster CRs, causes the TALM to automatically create a ClusterGroupUpgrade CR with the following characteristics:
* The ClusterGroupUpgrade CR is created and enabled in the ztp-install namespace.
* ClusterGroupUpgrade CR has the same name as the ManagedCluster CR.
* The cluster selector includes only the cluster associated with that ManagedCluster CR.
* The set of managed policies includes all policies that RHACM has bound to the cluster at the time the ClusterGroupUpgrade is created.
* Pre-caching is disabled.
* Timeout set to 4 hours (240 minutes).

The automatic creation of an enabled ClusterGroupUpgrade ensures that initial zero-touch deployment of clusters proceeds without the need for user intervention. Additionally, the automatic creation of a ClusterGroupUpgrade CR for any ManagedCluster without the ztp-done label allows a failed GitOps ZTP installation to be restarted by simply deleting the ClusterGroupUpgrade CR for the cluster.
Waves:: Each policy generated from a PolicyGenerator or PolicyGentemplate CR includes a ztp-deploy-wave annotation. This annotation is based on the same annotation from each CR which is included in that policy. The wave annotation is used to order the policies in the auto-generated ClusterGroupUpgrade CR. The wave annotation is not used other than for the auto-generated ClusterGroupUpgrade CR.

[NOTE]
----
All CRs in the same policy must have the same setting for the ztp-deploy-wave annotation. The default value of this annotation for each CR can be overridden in the PolicyGenerator or PolicyGentemplate. The wave annotation in the source CR is used for determining and setting the policy wave annotation. This annotation is removed from each built CR which is included in the generated policy at runtime.
----

The TALM applies the configuration policies in the order specified by the wave annotations. The TALM waits for each policy to be compliant before moving to the next policy. It is important to ensure that the wave annotation for each CR takes into account any prerequisites for those CRs to be applied to the cluster. For example, an Operator must be installed before or concurrently with the configuration for the Operator. Similarly, the CatalogSource for an Operator must be installed in a wave before or concurrently with the Operator Subscription. The default wave value for each CR takes these prerequisites into account.

Multiple CRs and policies can share the same wave number. Having fewer policies can result in faster deployments and lower CPU usage. It is a best practice to group many CRs into relatively few waves.

To check the default wave value in each source CR, run the following command against the out/source-crs directory that is extracted from the ztp-site-generate container image:


```terminal
$ grep -r "ztp-deploy-wave" out/source-crs
```


Phase labels:: The ClusterGroupUpgrade CR is automatically created and includes directives to annotate the ManagedCluster CR with labels at the start and end of the GitOps ZTP process.

When GitOps ZTP configuration postinstallation commences, the ManagedCluster has the ztp-running label applied. When all policies are remediated to the cluster and are fully compliant, these directives cause the TALM to remove the ztp-running label and apply the ztp-done label.

For deployments that make use of the informDuValidator policy, the ztp-done label is applied when the cluster is fully ready for deployment of applications. This includes all reconciliation and resulting effects of the GitOps ZTP applied configuration CRs. The ztp-done label affects automatic ClusterGroupUpgrade CR creation by TALM. Do not manipulate this label after the initial GitOps ZTP installation of the cluster.
Linked CRs:: The automatically created ClusterGroupUpgrade CR has the owner reference set as the ManagedCluster from which it was derived. This reference ensures that deleting the ManagedCluster CR causes the instance of the ClusterGroupUpgrade to be deleted along with any supporting resources.

# Overview of deploying managed clusters with GitOps ZTP

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) uses GitOps Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) to deploy single-node {product-title} clusters, three-node clusters, and standard clusters. You manage site configuration data as {product-title} custom resources (CRs) in a Git repository. GitOps ZTP uses a declarative GitOps approach for a develop once, deploy anywhere model to deploy the managed clusters.

The deployment of the clusters includes:

* Installing the host operating system (RHCOS) on a blank server
* Deploying {product-title}
* Creating cluster policies and site subscriptions
* Making the necessary network configurations to the server operating system
* Deploying profile Operators and performing any needed software-related configuration, such as performance profile, PTP, and SR-IOV

## Overview of the managed site installation process

After you apply the managed site custom resources (CRs) on the hub cluster, the following actions happen automatically:

1. A Discovery image ISO file is generated and booted on the target host.
2. When the ISO file successfully boots on the target host it reports the host hardware information to RHACM.
3. After all hosts are discovered, {product-title} is installed.
4. When {product-title} finishes installing, the hub installs the klusterlet service on the target cluster.
5. The requested add-on services are installed on the target cluster.

The Discovery image ISO process is complete when the Agent CR  for the managed cluster is created on the hub cluster.


[IMPORTANT]
----
The target bare-metal host must meet the networking, firmware, and hardware requirements listed in Recommended single-node OpenShift cluster configuration for vDU application workloads.
----

# Creating the managed bare-metal host secrets

Add the required Secret custom resources (CRs) for the managed bare-metal host to the hub cluster. You need a secret for the GitOps Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) pipeline to access the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) and a secret for the assisted installer service to pull cluster installation images from the registry.


[NOTE]
----
The secrets are referenced from the SiteConfig CR by name. The namespace
must match the SiteConfig namespace.
----

1. Create a YAML secret file containing credentials for the host Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) and a pull secret required for installing OpenShift and all add-on cluster Operators:
1. Save the following YAML as the file example-sno-secret.yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: example-sno-bmc-secret
  namespace: example-sno 1
data: 2
  password: <base64_password>
  username: <base64_username>
type: Opaque
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: pull-secret
  namespace: example-sno  3
data:
  .dockerconfigjson: <pull_secret> 4
type: kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
```

Must match the namespace configured in the related SiteConfig CR
Base64-encoded values for password and username
Must match the namespace configured in the related SiteConfig CR
Base64-encoded pull secret
2. Add the relative path to example-sno-secret.yaml to the kustomization.yaml file that you use to install the cluster.

# Configuring Discovery ISO kernel arguments for installations using GitOps ZTP

The GitOps Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) workflow uses the Discovery ISO as part of the {product-title} installation process on managed bare-metal hosts. You can edit the InfraEnv resource to specify kernel arguments for the Discovery ISO. This is useful for cluster installations with specific environmental requirements. For example, configure the rd.net.timeout.carrier kernel argument for the Discovery ISO to facilitate static networking for the cluster or to receive a DHCP address before downloading the root file system during installation.


[NOTE]
----
In {product-title} {product-version}, you can only add kernel arguments. You can not replace or delete kernel arguments.
----

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

1. Create the InfraEnv CR and edit the spec.kernelArguments specification to configure kernel arguments.
1. Save the following YAML in an InfraEnv-example.yaml file:

[NOTE]
----
The InfraEnv CR in this example uses template syntax such as {{ .Cluster.ClusterName }} that is populated based on values in the SiteConfig CR. The SiteConfig CR automatically populates values for these templates during deployment. Do not edit the templates manually.
----

```yaml
apiVersion: agent-install.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: InfraEnv
metadata:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "1"
  name: "{{ .Cluster.ClusterName }}"
  namespace: "{{ .Cluster.ClusterName }}"
spec:
  clusterRef:
    name: "{{ .Cluster.ClusterName }}"
    namespace: "{{ .Cluster.ClusterName }}"
  kernelArguments:
    - operation: append 1
      value: audit=0 2
    - operation: append
      value: trace=1
  sshAuthorizedKey: "{{ .Site.SshPublicKey }}"
  proxy: "{{ .Cluster.ProxySettings }}"
  pullSecretRef:
    name: "{{ .Site.PullSecretRef.Name }}"
  ignitionConfigOverride: "{{ .Cluster.IgnitionConfigOverride }}"
  nmStateConfigLabelSelector:
    matchLabels:
      nmstate-label: "{{ .Cluster.ClusterName }}"
  additionalNTPSources: "{{ .Cluster.AdditionalNTPSources }}"
```

Specify the append operation to add a kernel argument.
Specify the kernel argument you want to configure. This example configures the audit kernel argument and the trace kernel argument.
2. Commit the InfraEnv-example.yaml CR to the same location in your Git repository that has the SiteConfig CR and push your changes. The following example shows a sample Git repository structure:

```text
~/example-ztp/install
          └── site-install
               ├── siteconfig-example.yaml
               ├── InfraEnv-example.yaml
               ...
```

3. Edit the spec.clusters.crTemplates specification in the SiteConfig CR to reference the InfraEnv-example.yaml CR in your Git repository:

```yaml
clusters:
  crTemplates:
    InfraEnv: "InfraEnv-example.yaml"
```


When you are ready to deploy your cluster by committing and pushing the SiteConfig CR, the build pipeline uses the custom InfraEnv-example CR in your Git repository to configure the infrastructure environment, including the custom kernel arguments.

To verify that the kernel arguments are applied, after the Discovery image verifies that {product-title} is ready for installation, you can SSH to the target host before the installation process begins. At that point, you can view the kernel arguments for the Discovery ISO in the /proc/cmdline file.

1. Begin an SSH session with the target host:

```terminal
$ ssh -i /path/to/privatekey core@<host_name>
```

2. View the system's kernel arguments by using the following command:

```terminal
$ cat /proc/cmdline
```


# Deploying a managed cluster with SiteConfig and GitOps ZTP

Use the following procedure to create a SiteConfig custom resource (CR) and related files and initiate the GitOps Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) cluster deployment.


[IMPORTANT]
----
SiteConfig v1 is deprecated starting with {product-title} version 4.18. Equivalent and improved functionality is now available through the SiteConfig Operator using the ClusterInstance custom resource. For more information, see Procedure to transition from SiteConfig CRs to the ClusterInstance API.
For more information about the SiteConfig Operator, see SiteConfig.
----

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* You configured the hub cluster for generating the required installation and policy CRs.
* You created a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data. The repository must be accessible from the hub cluster and you must configure it as a source repository for the ArgoCD application. See "Preparing the GitOps ZTP site configuration repository" for more information.

[NOTE]
----
When you create the source repository, ensure that you patch the ArgoCD application with the argocd/deployment/argocd-openshift-gitops-patch.json patch-file that you extract from the ztp-site-generate container. See "Configuring the hub cluster with ArgoCD".
----
* To be ready for provisioning managed clusters, you require the following for each bare-metal host:
Network connectivity:: Your network requires DNS. Managed cluster hosts should be reachable from the hub cluster. Ensure that Layer 3 connectivity exists between the hub cluster and the managed cluster host.
Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) details:: GitOps ZTP uses BMC username and password details to connect to the BMC during cluster installation. The GitOps ZTP plugin manages the ManagedCluster CRs on the hub cluster based on the SiteConfig CR in your site Git repo. You create individual BMCSecret CRs for each host manually.
Procedure
1. Create the required managed cluster secrets on the hub cluster. These resources must be in a namespace with a name matching the cluster name. For example, in out/argocd/example/siteconfig/example-sno.yaml, the cluster name and namespace is example-sno.
1. Export the cluster namespace by running the following command:

```terminal
$ export CLUSTERNS=example-sno
```

2. Create the namespace:

```terminal
$ oc create namespace $CLUSTERNS
```

2. Create pull secret and BMC Secret CRs for the managed cluster. The pull secret must contain all the credentials necessary for installing {product-title} and all required Operators. See "Creating the managed bare-metal host secrets" for more information.

[NOTE]
----
The secrets are referenced from the SiteConfig custom resource (CR) by name. The namespace must match the SiteConfig namespace.
----
3. Create a SiteConfig CR for your cluster in your local clone of the Git repository:
1. Choose the appropriate example for your CR from the  out/argocd/example/siteconfig/ folder.
The folder includes example files for single node, three-node, and standard clusters:
* example-sno.yaml
* example-3node.yaml
* example-standard.yaml
2. Change the cluster and host details in the example file to match the type of cluster you want. For example:
Example single-node OpenShift SiteConfig CR

```yaml
# example-node1-bmh-secret & assisted-deployment-pull-secret need to be created under same namespace example-sno

[NOTE]
----
For more information about BMC addressing, see the "Additional resources" section. The installConfigOverrides and  ignitionConfigOverride fields are expanded in the example for ease of readability.
----

[NOTE]
----
To override the default BareMetalHost CR for a node, you can reference the override CR in the node-level crTemplates field in the SiteConfig CR. Ensure that you set the argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "3" annotation in your override BareMetalHost CR.
----
3. You can inspect the default set of extra-manifest MachineConfig CRs in out/argocd/extra-manifest. It is automatically applied to the cluster when it is installed.
4. Optional: To provision additional install-time manifests on the provisioned cluster, create a directory in your Git repository, for example, sno-extra-manifest/, and add your custom manifest CRs to this directory. If your SiteConfig.yaml refers to this directory in the extraManifestPath field, any CRs in this referenced directory are appended to the default set of extra manifests.
Enabling the crun OCI container runtime

[IMPORTANT]
----
For optimal cluster performance, enable crun for master and worker nodes in single-node OpenShift, single-node OpenShift with additional worker nodes, three-node OpenShift, and standard clusters.
Enable crun in a ContainerRuntimeConfig CR as an additional Day 0 install-time manifest to avoid the cluster having to reboot.
The enable-crun-master.yaml and enable-crun-worker.yaml CR files are in the out/source-crs/optional-extra-manifest/ folder that you can extract from the ztp-site-generate container.
For more information, see "Customizing extra installation manifests in the GitOps ZTP pipeline".
----
4. Add the SiteConfig CR to the kustomization.yaml file in the generators section, similar to the example shown in out/argocd/example/siteconfig/kustomization.yaml.
5. Commit the SiteConfig CR and associated kustomization.yaml changes in your Git repository and push the changes.

The ArgoCD pipeline detects the changes and begins the managed cluster deployment.

* Verify that the custom roles and labels are applied after the node is deployed:

```terminal
$ oc describe node example-node.example.com
```



```terminal
Name:   example-node.example.com

## Accelerated provisioning of GitOps ZTP


[IMPORTANT]
----
{FeatureName} is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
----

You can reduce the time taken for cluster installation by using accelerated provisioning of GitOps ZTP for single-node OpenShift.
Accelerated ZTP speeds up installation by applying Day 2 manifests derived from policies at an earlier stage.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Accelerated provisioning of GitOps ZTP is supported only when installing single-node OpenShift with Assisted Installer. Otherwise this installation method will fail.
----

### Activating accelerated ZTP

You can activate accelerated ZTP using the spec.clusters.clusterLabels.accelerated-ztp label, as in the following example:


```yaml
apiVersion: ran.openshift.io/v2
kind: SiteConfig
metadata:
  name: "example-sno"
  namespace: "example-sno"
spec:
  baseDomain: "example.com"
  pullSecretRef:
    name: "assisted-deployment-pull-secret"
  clusterImageSetNameRef: "openshift-4.20"
  sshPublicKey: "ssh-rsa AAAA..."
  clusters:
  # ...
    clusterLabels:
        common: true
        group-du-sno: ""
        sites : "example-sno"
        accelerated-ztp: full
```


You can use accelerated-ztp: full to fully automate the accelerated process.
GitOps ZTP updates the AgentClusterInstall resource with a reference to the accelerated GitOps ZTP ConfigMap, and includes resources extracted from policies by TALM, and accelerated ZTP job manifests.

If you use accelerated-ztp: partial, GitOps ZTP does not include the accelerated job manifests, but includes policy-derived objects created during the cluster installation of the following kind types:

* PerformanceProfile.performance.openshift.io
* Tuned.tuned.openshift.io
* Namespace
* CatalogSource.operators.coreos.com
* ContainerRuntimeConfig.machineconfiguration.openshift.io

This partial acceleration can reduce the number of reboots done by the node when applying resources of the kind Performance Profile, Tuned, and ContainerRuntimeConfig.
TALM installs the Operator subscriptions derived from policies after RHACM completes the import of the cluster, following the same flow as standard GitOps ZTP.

The benefits of accelerated ZTP increase with the scale of your deployment.
Using accelerated-ztp: full gives more benefit on a large number of clusters.
With a smaller number of clusters, the reduction in installation time is less significant.
Full accelerated ZTP leaves behind a namespace and a completed job on the spoke that need to be manually removed.

One benefit of using accelerated-ztp: partial is that you can override the functionality of the on-spoke job if something goes wrong with the stock implementation or if you require a custom functionality.

### The accelerated ZTP process

Accelerated ZTP uses an additional ConfigMap to create the resources derived from policies on the spoke cluster.
The standard ConfigMap includes manifests that the GitOps ZTP workflow uses to customize cluster installs.

TALM detects that the accelerated-ztp label is set and then creates a second ConfigMap.
As part of accelerated ZTP, the SiteConfig generator adds a reference to that second ConfigMap using the naming convention <spoke-cluster-name>-aztp.

After TALM creates that second ConfigMap, it finds all policies bound to the managed cluster and extracts the GitOps ZTP profile information.
TALM adds the GitOps ZTP profile information to the <spoke-cluster-name>-aztp ConfigMap custom resource (CR) and applies the CR to the hub cluster API.

## Configuring IPsec encryption for single-node OpenShift clusters using GitOps ZTP and SiteConfig resources

You can enable IPsec encryption in managed single-node OpenShift clusters that you install using GitOps ZTP and Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM).
You can encrypt traffic between the managed cluster and IPsec endpoints external to the managed cluster. All network traffic between nodes on the OVN-Kubernetes cluster network is encrypted with IPsec in Transport mode.


[IMPORTANT]
----
You can also configure IPsec encryption for single-node OpenShift clusters with an additional worker node by following this procedure. It is recommended to use the MachineConfig custom resource (CR) to configure IPsec encryption for single-node OpenShift clusters and single-node OpenShift clusters with an additional worker node because of their low resource availability.
----

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* You have configured RHACM and the hub cluster for generating the required installation and policy custom resources (CRs) for managed clusters.
* You have created a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data.
The repository must be accessible from the hub cluster and be defined as a source repository for the Argo CD application.
* You have installed the butane utility version 0.20.0 or later.
* You have a PKCS#12 certificate for the IPsec endpoint and a CA cert in PEM format.

1. Extract the latest version of the ztp-site-generate container source and merge it with your repository where you manage your custom site configuration data.
2. Configure optional-extra-manifest/ipsec/ipsec-endpoint-config.yaml with the required values that configure IPsec in the cluster. For example:

```yaml
interfaces:
- name: hosta_conn
  type: ipsec
  libreswan:
    left: '%defaultroute'
    leftid: '%fromcert'
    leftmodecfgclient: false
    leftcert: left_server 1
    leftrsasigkey: '%cert'
    right: <external_host> 2
    rightid: '%fromcert'
    rightrsasigkey: '%cert'
    rightsubnet: <external_address> 3
    ikev2: insist 4
    type: tunnel
```

The value of this field must match with the name of the certificate used on the remote system.
Replace <external_host> with the external host IP address or DNS hostname.
Replace <external_address> with the IP subnet of the external host on the other side of the IPsec tunnel.
Use the IKEv2 VPN encryption protocol only. Do not use IKEv1, which is deprecated.
3. Add the following certificates to the optional-extra-manifest/ipsec folder:
* left_server.p12: The certificate bundle for the IPsec endpoints
* ca.pem: The certificate authority that you signed your certificates with

The certificate files are required for the Network Security Services (NSS) database on each host. These files are imported as part of the Butane configuration in later steps.
4. Open a shell prompt at the optional-extra-manifest/ipsec folder of the Git repository where you maintain your custom site configuration data.
5. Run the optional-extra-manifest/ipsec/build.sh script to generate the required Butane and MachineConfig CRs files.

If the PKCS#12 certificate is protected with a password, set the -W argument.
Example output

```terminal
out
 └── argocd
      └── example
           └── optional-extra-manifest
                └── ipsec
                     ├── 99-ipsec-master-endpoint-config.bu 1
                     ├── 99-ipsec-master-endpoint-config.yaml 1
                     ├── 99-ipsec-worker-endpoint-config.bu 1
                     ├── 99-ipsec-worker-endpoint-config.yaml 1
                     ├── build.sh
                     ├── ca.pem 2
                     ├── left_server.p12 2
                     ├── enable-ipsec.yaml
                     ├── ipsec-endpoint-config.yml
                     └── README.md
```

The ipsec/build.sh script generates the Butane and endpoint configuration CRs.
You provide ca.pem and left_server.p12 certificate files that are relevant to your network.
6. Create a custom-manifest/ folder in the repository where you manage your custom site configuration data.
Add the enable-ipsec.yaml and 99-ipsec-* YAML files to the directory.
For example:

```terminal
siteconfig
  ├── site1-sno-du.yaml
  ├── extra-manifest/
  └── custom-manifest
        ├── enable-ipsec.yaml
        ├── 99-ipsec-worker-endpoint-config.yaml
        └── 99-ipsec-master-endpoint-config.yaml
```

7. In your SiteConfig CR, add the custom-manifest/ directory to the extraManifests.searchPaths field.
For example:

```yaml
clusters:
- clusterName: "site1-sno-du"
  networkType: "OVNKubernetes"
  extraManifests:
    searchPaths:
      - extra-manifest/
      - custom-manifest/
```

8. Commit the SiteConfig CR changes and updated files in your Git repository and push the changes to provision the managed cluster and configure IPsec encryption.

The Argo CD pipeline detects the changes and begins the managed cluster deployment.

During cluster provisioning, the GitOps ZTP pipeline appends the CRs in the custom-manifest/ directory to the default set of extra manifests stored in the extra-manifest/ directory.

                     ├── ipsec-config-policy.yaml
                     └── README.md
```

The ipsec/import-certs.sh script generates the Butane and endpoint configuration CRs.
Add the ca.pem and left_server.p12 certificate files that are relevant to your network.
6. Create a custom-manifest/ folder in the repository where you manage your custom site configuration data and add the enable-ipsec.yaml and 99-ipsec-* YAML files to the directory.
Example siteconfig directory

```terminal
siteconfig
  ├── site1-mno-du.yaml
  ├── extra-manifest/
  └── custom-manifest
        ├── enable-ipsec.yaml
        ├── 99-ipsec-master-import-certs.yaml
        └── 99-ipsec-worker-import-certs.yaml
```

7. In your SiteConfig CR, add the custom-manifest/ directory to the extraManifests.searchPaths field, as in the following example:

```yaml
clusters:
- clusterName: "site1-mno-du"
  networkType: "OVNKubernetes"
  extraManifests:
    searchPaths:
      - extra-manifest/
      - custom-manifest/
```

8. Include the ipsec-config-policy.yaml config policy file in the source-crs directory in GitOps and reference the file in one of the PolicyGenerator CRs.
9. Commit the SiteConfig CR changes and updated files in your Git repository and push the changes to provision the managed cluster and configure IPsec encryption.

The Argo CD pipeline detects the changes and begins the managed cluster deployment.

During cluster provisioning, the GitOps ZTP pipeline appends the CRs in the custom-manifest/ directory to the default set of extra manifests stored in the extra-manifest/ directory.

## Verifying the IPsec encryption

You can verify that the IPsec encryption is successfully applied in a managed {product-title} cluster.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* You have configured the IPsec encryption.

1. Start a debug pod for the managed cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc debug node/<node_name>
```

2. Check that the IPsec policy is applied in the cluster node by running the following command:

```terminal
sh-5.1# ip xfrm policy
```

4. Ping a known IP in the external host subnet by running the following command:
For example, ping an IP address in the rightsubnet range that you set in the ipsec/ipsec-endpoint-config.yaml file:

```terminal
sh-5.1# ping 172.16.110.8
```

Example output

```terminal
PING 172.16.110.8 (172.16.110.8) 56(84) bytes of data.

# Managing host firmware settings with GitOps ZTP

Hosts require the correct firmware configuration to ensure high performance and optimal efficiency.
You can deploy custom host firmware configurations for managed clusters with GitOps ZTP.

Tune hosts with specific hardware profiles in your lab and ensure they are optimized for your requirements.
When you have completed host tuning to your satisfaction, you extract the host profile and save it in your GitOps ZTP repository.
Then, you use the host profile to configure firmware settings in the managed cluster hosts that you deploy with GitOps ZTP.

You specify the required hardware profiles in SiteConfig custom resources (CRs) that you use to deploy the managed clusters.
The GitOps ZTP pipeline generates the required HostFirmwareSettings (HFS) and BareMetalHost (BMH) CRs that are applied to the hub cluster.

Use the following best practices to manage your host firmware profiles.

Identify critical firmware settings with hardware vendors:: Work with hardware vendors to identify and document critical host firmware settings required for optimal performance and compatibility with the deployed host platform.
Use common firmware configurations across similar hardware platforms:: Where possible, use a standardized host firmware configuration across similar hardware platforms to reduce complexity and potential errors during deployment.
Test firmware configurations in a lab environment:: Test host firmware configurations in a controlled lab environment before deploying in production to ensure that settings are compatible with hardware, firmware, and software.
Manage firmware profiles in source control:: Manage host firmware profiles in Git repositories to track changes, ensure consistency, and facilitate collaboration with vendors.

* Recommended firmware configuration for vDU cluster hosts

## Retrieving the host firmware schema for a managed cluster

You can discover the host firmware schema for managed clusters.
The host firmware schema for bare-metal hosts is populated with information that the Ironic API returns.
The API returns information about host firmware interfaces, including firmware setting types, allowable values, ranges, and flags.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have installed Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) and logged in to the hub cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* You have provisioned a cluster that is managed by RHACM.

* Discover the host firmware schema for the managed cluster.
Run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get firmwareschema -n <managed_cluster_namespace> -o yaml
```

Example output

```terminal

## Retrieving the host firmware settings for a managed cluster

You can retrieve the host firmware settings for managed clusters.
This is useful when you have deployed changes to the host firmware and you want to monitor the changes and ensure that they are applied successfully.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have installed Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) and logged in to the hub cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* You have provisioned a cluster that is managed by RHACM.

1. Retrieve the host firmware settings for the managed cluster.
Run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get hostfirmwaresettings -n <cluster_namespace> <node_name> -o yaml
```

      # ...
```

Indicates that a change in the host firmware settings has been detected
Indicates that the host has an invalid firmware setting
The complete list of configured host firmware settings is returned under the status.settings field
2. Optional: Check the status of the HostFirmwareSettings (hfs) custom resource in the cluster:

```terminal
$ oc get hfs -n <managed_cluster_namespace> <managed_cluster_name> -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="ChangeDetected")].status}'
```

Example output

```terminal
True
```

3. Optional: Check for invalid firmware settings in the cluster host.
Run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get hfs -n <managed_cluster_namespace> <managed_cluster_name> -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Valid")].status}'
```

Example output

```terminal
False
```


## Deploying user-defined firmware to cluster hosts with GitOps ZTP

You can deploy user-defined firmware settings to cluster hosts by configuring the SiteConfig custom resource (CR) to include a hardware profile that you want to apply during cluster host provisioning.
You can configure hardware profiles to apply to hosts in the following scenarios:

* All hosts site-wide
* Only cluster hosts that meet certain criteria
* Individual cluster hosts


[IMPORTANT]
----
You can configure host hardware profiles to be applied in a hierarchy.
Cluster-level settings override site-wide settings.
Node level profiles override cluster and site-wide settings.
----

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have installed Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) and logged in to the hub cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* You have provisioned a cluster that is managed by RHACM.
* You created a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data.
The repository must be accessible from the hub cluster and be defined as a source repository for the Argo CD application.

1. Create the host firmware profile that contain the firmware settings you want to apply.
For example, create the following YAML file:
host-firmware.profile

```yaml
BootMode: Uefi
LogicalProc: Enabled
ProcVirtualization: Enabled
```

2. Save the hardware profile YAML file relative to the kustomization.yaml file that you use to define how to provision the cluster, for example:

```terminal
example-ztp/install
    └── site-install
          ├── siteconfig-example.yaml
          ├── kustomization.yaml
          └── host-firmware.profile
```

3. Edit the SiteConfig CR to include the firmware profile that you want to apply in the cluster.
For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: ran.openshift.io/v1
kind: SiteConfig
metadata:
  name: "site-plan-cluster"
  namespace: "example-cluster-namespace"
spec:
  baseDomain: "example.com"
  # ...
  biosConfigRef:
    filePath: "./host-firmware.profile" 1
```

Applies the hardware profile to all cluster hosts site-wide

[NOTE]
----
Where possible, use a single SiteConfig CR per cluster.
----
4. Optional. To apply a hardware profile to hosts in a specific cluster, update clusters.biosConfigRef.filePath with the hardware profile that you want to apply.
For example:

```yaml
clusters:
  - clusterName: "cluster-1"
    # ...
    biosConfigRef:
      filePath: "./host-firmware.profile" 1
```

Applies to all hosts in the cluster-1 cluster
5. Optional. To apply a hardware profile to a specific host in the cluster, update clusters.nodes.biosConfigRef.filePath with the hardware profile that you want to apply.
For example:

```yaml
clusters:
  - clusterName: "cluster-1"
    # ...
    nodes:
      - hostName: "compute-1.example.com"
        # ...
        bootMode: "UEFI"
        biosConfigRef:
          filePath: "./host-firmware.profile" 1
```

Applies the firmware profile to the compute-1.example.com host in the cluster
6. Commit the SiteConfig CR and associated kustomization.yaml changes in your Git repository and push the changes.

The ArgoCD pipeline detects the changes and begins the managed cluster deployment.

[NOTE]
----
Cluster deployment proceeds even if an invalid firmware setting is detected.
To apply a correction using GitOps ZTP, re-deploy the cluster with the corrected hardware profile.
----

* Check that the firmware settings have been applied in the managed cluster host.
For example, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get hfs -n <managed_cluster_namespace> <managed_cluster_name> -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Valid")].status}'
```

Example output

```terminal
True
```


# Monitoring managed cluster installation progress

The ArgoCD pipeline uses the SiteConfig CR to generate the cluster configuration CRs and syncs it with the hub cluster. You can monitor the progress of the synchronization in the ArgoCD dashboard.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

When the synchronization is complete, the installation generally proceeds as follows:

1. The Assisted Service Operator installs {product-title} on the cluster. You can monitor the progress of cluster installation from the RHACM dashboard or from the command line by running the following commands:
1. Export the cluster name:

```terminal
$ export CLUSTER=<clusterName>
```

2. Query the AgentClusterInstall CR for the managed cluster:

```terminal
$ oc get agentclusterinstall -n $CLUSTER $CLUSTER -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Completed")]}' | jq
```

3. Get the installation events for the cluster:

```terminal
$ curl -sk $(oc get agentclusterinstall -n $CLUSTER $CLUSTER -o jsonpath='{.status.debugInfo.eventsURL}')  | jq '.[-2,-1]'
```


# Troubleshooting GitOps ZTP by validating the installation CRs

The ArgoCD pipeline uses the SiteConfig and PolicyGenerator or PolicyGentemplate custom resources (CRs) to generate the cluster configuration CRs and Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) policies. Use the following steps to troubleshoot issues that might occur during this process.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

1. Check that the installation CRs were created by using the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get AgentClusterInstall -n <cluster_name>
```


If no object is returned, use the following steps to troubleshoot the ArgoCD pipeline flow from SiteConfig files to the installation CRs.
2. Verify that the ManagedCluster CR was generated using the SiteConfig CR on the hub cluster:

```terminal
$ oc get managedcluster
```

3. If the ManagedCluster is missing, check if the clusters application failed to synchronize the files from the Git repository to the hub cluster:

```terminal
$ oc get applications.argoproj.io -n openshift-gitops clusters -o yaml
```

1. To identify error logs for the managed cluster, inspect the status.operationState.syncResult.resources field. For example, if an invalid value is assigned to the extraManifestPath in the SiteConfig CR, an error similar to the following is generated:

```text
syncResult:
  resources:
  - group: ran.openshift.io
    kind: SiteConfig
    message: The Kubernetes API could not find ran.openshift.io/SiteConfig for
      requested resource spoke-sno/spoke-sno. Make sure the "SiteConfig" CRD is
      installed on the destination cluster
```

2. To see a more detailed SiteConfig error, complete the following steps:
1. In the Argo CD dashboard, click the SiteConfig resource that Argo CD is trying to sync.
2. Check the DESIRED MANIFEST tab to find the siteConfigError field.

```text
siteConfigError: >- Error: could not build the entire SiteConfig defined by /tmp/kust-plugin-config-1081291903: stat sno-extra-manifest: no such file or directory
```

3. Check the Status.Sync field. If there are log errors, the Status.Sync field could indicate an Unknown error:

```text
Status:
  Sync:
    Compared To:
      Destination:
        Namespace:  clusters-sub
        Server:     https://kubernetes.default.svc
      Source:
        Path:             sites-config
        Repo URL:         https://git.com/ran-sites/siteconfigs/.git
        Target Revision:  master
    Status:               Unknown
```


# Troubleshooting GitOps ZTP virtual media booting on SuperMicro servers

SuperMicro X11 servers do not support virtual media installations when the image is served using the https protocol. As a result, single-node OpenShift deployments for this environment fail to boot on the target node. To avoid this issue, log in to the hub cluster and disable Transport Layer Security (TLS) in the Provisioning resource. This ensures the image is not served with TLS even though the image address uses the https scheme.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

1. Disable TLS in the Provisioning resource by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc patch provisioning provisioning-configuration --type merge -p '{"spec":{"disableVirtualMediaTLS": true}}'
```

2. Continue the steps to deploy your single-node OpenShift cluster.

# Removing a managed cluster site from the GitOps ZTP pipeline

You can remove a managed site and the associated installation and configuration policy CRs from the GitOps Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) pipeline.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

1. Remove a site and the associated CRs by removing the associated SiteConfig and PolicyGenerator or PolicyGentemplate files from the kustomization.yaml file.
2. Add the following syncOptions field to your SiteConfig application.

```yaml
kind: Application
spec:
  syncPolicy:
    syncOptions:
    - PrunePropagationPolicy=background
```


When you run the GitOps ZTP pipeline again, the generated CRs are removed.
3. Optional: If you want to permanently remove a site, you should also remove the SiteConfig and site-specific PolicyGenerator or PolicyGentemplate files from the Git repository.
4. Optional: If you want to remove a site temporarily, for example when redeploying a site, you can leave the SiteConfig and site-specific PolicyGenerator or PolicyGentemplate CRs in the Git repository.

* For information about removing a cluster, see Removing a cluster from management.

# Removing obsolete content from the GitOps ZTP pipeline

If a change to the PolicyGenerator or PolicyGentemplate configuration results in obsolete policies, for example, if you rename policies, use the following procedure to remove the obsolete policies.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

1. Remove the affected PolicyGenerator or PolicyGentemplate files from the Git repository, commit and push to the remote repository.
2. Wait for the changes to synchronize through the application and the affected policies to be removed from the hub cluster.
3. Add the updated PolicyGenerator or PolicyGentemplate files back to the Git repository, and then commit and push to the remote repository.

[NOTE]
----
Removing GitOps Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) policies from the Git repository, and as a result also removing them from the hub cluster, does not affect the configuration of the managed cluster. The policy and CRs managed by that policy remains in place on the managed cluster.
----
4. Optional: As an alternative, after making changes to PolicyGenerator or PolicyGentemplate CRs that result in obsolete policies, you can remove these policies from the hub cluster manually. You can delete policies from the RHACM console using the Governance tab or by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete policy -n <namespace> <policy_name>
```


# Tearing down the GitOps ZTP pipeline

You can remove the ArgoCD pipeline and all generated GitOps Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) artifacts.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

1. Detach all clusters from Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) on the hub cluster.
2. Delete the kustomization.yaml file in the deployment directory using the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete -k out/argocd/deployment
```

3. Commit and push your changes to the site repository.
