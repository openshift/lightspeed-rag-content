# Security


Implementing a robust cluster security profile is important for building resilient environments.

# Authentication

Determine which identity providers are in your cluster.
For more information about supported identity providers, see "Supported identity providers" in Authentication and authorization.

After you know which providers are configured, you can inspect the openshift-authentication namespace to determine if there are potential issues.

1. Check the events in the openshift-authentication namespace by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get events -n openshift-authentication --sort-by='.metadata.creationTimestamp'
```

2. Check the pods in the openshift-authentication namespace by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get pod -n openshift-authentication
```

3. Optional: If you need more information, check the logs of one of the running pods by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc logs -n openshift-authentication <pod_name>
```
