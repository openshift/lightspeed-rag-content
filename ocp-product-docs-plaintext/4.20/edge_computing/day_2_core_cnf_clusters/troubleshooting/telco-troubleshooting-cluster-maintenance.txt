# Cluster maintenance


In telco networks, you must pay more attention to certain configurations due the nature of bare-metal deployments.
You can troubleshoot more effectively by completing these tasks:
* Monitor for failed or failing hardware components
* Periodically check the status of the cluster Operators

[NOTE]
----
For hardware monitoring, contact your hardware vendor to find the appropriate logging tool for your specific hardware.

# Checking cluster Operators

Periodically check the status of your cluster Operators to find issues early.

* Check the status of the cluster Operators by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get co
```


# Watching for failed pods

To reduce troubleshooting time, regularly monitor for failed pods in your cluster.

* To watch for failed pods, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get po -A | grep -Eiv 'complete|running'
```
