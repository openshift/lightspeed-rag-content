# {product-title} architecture



# Introduction to {product-title}

{product-title} is a platform for developing and running containerized applications. It is designed to allow applications and the data centers that support them to expand from just a few machines and applications to thousands of machines that serve millions of clients.

With its foundation in Kubernetes, {product-title} incorporates the same technology that serves as the engine for massive telecommunications, streaming video, gaming, banking, and other applications. Its implementation in open
Red&#160;Hat technologies lets you extend your containerized applications beyond a single cloud to on-premise and multi-cloud environments.

## About Kubernetes

Although container images and the containers that run from them are the
primary building blocks for modern application development, to run them at scale
requires a reliable and flexible distribution system. Kubernetes is the
defacto standard for orchestrating containers.

Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration engine for automating
deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. The general
concept of Kubernetes is fairly simple:

* Start with one or more worker nodes to run the container workloads.
* Manage the deployment of those workloads from one or more control plane nodes.
* Wrap containers in a deployment unit called a pod. Using pods provides extra
metadata with the container and offers the ability to group several containers
in a single deployment entity.
* Create special kinds of assets. For example, services are represented by a
set of pods and a policy that defines how they are accessed. This policy
allows containers to connect to the services that they need even if they do not
have the specific IP addresses for the services. Replication controllers are
another special asset that indicates how many pod replicas are required to run
at a time. You can use this capability to automatically scale your application
to adapt to its current demand.

In only a few years, Kubernetes has seen massive cloud and on-premise adoption.
The open source development model allows many people to extend Kubernetes
by implementing different technologies for components such as networking,
storage, and authentication.

## The benefits of containerized applications

Using containerized applications offers many advantages over using traditional deployment methods. Where applications were once expected to be installed on operating systems that included all their dependencies, containers let an application carry their dependencies with them. Creating containerized applications offers many benefits.

### Operating system benefits

Containers use small, dedicated Linux operating systems without a kernel. Their file system, networking, cgroups, process tables, and namespaces are separate from the host Linux system, but the containers can integrate with the hosts seamlessly when necessary. Being based on Linux allows containers to use all the advantages that come with the open source development model of rapid innovation.

Because each container uses a dedicated operating system, you can deploy applications that require conflicting software dependencies on the same host. Each container carries its own dependent software and manages its own interfaces, such as networking and file systems, so applications never need to compete for those assets.

### Deployment and scaling benefits

If you employ rolling upgrades between major releases of your application, you can continuously improve your applications without downtime and still maintain compatibility with the current release.

You can also deploy and test a new version of an application alongside the existing version. If the container passes your tests, simply deploy more new containers and remove the old ones. 

Since all the software dependencies for an application are resolved within the container itself, you can use a standardized operating system on each host in your data center. You do not need to configure a specific operating system for each application host. When your data center needs more capacity, you can deploy another generic host system.

Similarly, scaling containerized applications is simple. {product-title} offers a simple, standard way of scaling any containerized service. For example, if you build applications as a set of microservices rather than large, monolithic applications, you can scale the individual microservices individually to meet demand. This capability allows you to scale only the required services instead of the entire application, which can allow you to meet application demands while using minimal resources.

## {product-title} overview

{product-title} provides enterprise-ready enhancements to Kubernetes, including the following enhancements:

* Integrated Red Hat technology. Major components in {product-title} come from Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and related Red Hat technologies. {product-title} benefits from the intense testing and certification initiatives for Red Hat's enterprise quality software.
* Open source development model. Development is completed in the open, and the source code is available from public software repositories. This open collaboration fosters rapid innovation and development.

Although Kubernetes excels at managing your applications, it does not specify
or manage platform-level requirements or deployment processes. Powerful and
flexible platform management tools and processes are important benefits that
{product-title} {product-version} offers. The following sections describe some
unique features and benefits of {product-title}.

### Custom operating system

{product-title} uses Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS), a container-oriented operating system that is specifically designed for running containerized applications from {product-title} and works with new tools to provide fast installation, Operator-based management, and simplified upgrades.

RHCOS includes:

* Ignition, which {product-title} uses as a firstboot system configuration for initially bringing up and configuring machines.
* CRI-O, a Kubernetes native container runtime implementation that integrates closely with the operating system to deliver an efficient and optimized Kubernetes experience. CRI-O provides facilities for running, stopping, and restarting containers. It fully replaces the Docker Container Engine, which was used in {product-title} 3.
* Kubelet, the primary node agent for Kubernetes that is responsible for
launching and monitoring containers.

In {product-title} {product-version}, you must use RHCOS for all control
plane machines, but you can use Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) as the operating
system for compute machines, which are also known as worker machines. If you choose to use RHEL workers, you
must perform more system maintenance than if you use RHCOS for all of the
cluster machines.

### Simplified installation and update process

With {product-title} {product-version}, if you have an account with the right
permissions, you can deploy a production cluster in supported clouds by running
a single command and providing a few values. You can also customize your cloud
installation or install your cluster in your data center if you use a supported
platform.

For clusters that use RHCOS for all machines, updating, or
upgrading, {product-title} is a simple, highly-automated process. Because
{product-title} completely controls the systems and services that run on each
machine, including the operating system itself, from a central control plane,
upgrades are designed to become automatic events. If your cluster contains
RHEL worker machines, the control plane benefits from the streamlined update
process, but you must perform more tasks to upgrade the RHEL machines.

### Other key features

Operators are both the fundamental unit of the {product-title} {product-version}
code base and a convenient way to deploy applications and software components
for your applications to use. In {product-title}, Operators serve as the platform foundation and remove the need for manual upgrades of operating systems and control plane applications. {product-title} Operators such as the
Cluster Version Operator and Machine Config Operator allow simplified,
cluster-wide management of those critical components.

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) and the software catalog provide facilities for
storing and distributing Operators to people developing and deploying applications.

The Red Hat Quay Container Registry is a Quay.io container registry that serves
most of the container images and Operators to {product-title} clusters.
Quay.io is a public registry version of Red Hat Quay that stores millions of images
and tags.

Other enhancements to Kubernetes in {product-title} include improvements in
software defined networking (SDN), authentication, log aggregation, monitoring,
and routing. {product-title} also offers a comprehensive web console and the
custom OpenShift CLI (oc) interface.

## Internet access for {product-title}

In {product-title} {product-version}, you require access to the internet to
install
your cluster.

You must have internet access to perform the following actions:

* Access OpenShift Cluster Manager to download the installation program and perform subscription management. If the cluster has internet access and you do not disable Telemetry, that service automatically entitles your cluster.
* Access Quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install your cluster.
* Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.
