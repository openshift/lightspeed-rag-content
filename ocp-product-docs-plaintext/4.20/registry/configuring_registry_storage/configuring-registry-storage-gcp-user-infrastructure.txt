# Configuring the registry for GCP user-provisioned infrastructure



# Configuring a secret for the Image Registry Operator

In addition to the configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io and ConfigMap
resources, configuration is provided to the Operator by a separate secret
resource located within the openshift-image-registry namespace.

The image-registry-private-configuration-user secret provides
credentials needed for storage access and management. It overrides the default
credentials used by the Operator, if default credentials were found.

For GCS on GCP storage, the secret is expected to contain one key whose value is the
contents of a credentials file provided by GCP:

* REGISTRY_STORAGE_GCS_KEYFILE

* Create an {product-title} secret that contains the required keys.

```terminal
$ oc create secret generic image-registry-private-configuration-user --from-file=REGISTRY_STORAGE_GCS_KEYFILE=<path_to_keyfile> --namespace openshift-image-registry
```


# Configuring the registry storage for GCP with user-provisioned infrastructure

If the Registry Operator cannot create a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) bucket, you must set up the storage medium manually and configure the settings in the registry custom resource (CR).

* A cluster on GCP with user-provisioned infrastructure.
* To configure registry storage for GCP, you need to provide Registry Operator
cloud credentials.
* For GCS on GCP storage, the secret is expected to contain one key whose value is the
contents of a credentials file provided by GCP:
* REGISTRY_STORAGE_GCS_KEYFILE

1. Set up an Object Lifecycle Management policy to abort incomplete multipart uploads that are one day old.
2. Fill in the storage configuration in configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster:

```terminal
$ oc edit configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster
```

Example configuration

```yaml
# ...
storage:
  gcs:
    bucket: <bucket-name>
    projectID: <project-id>
    region: <region-name>
# ...
```



[WARNING]
----
You can secure your registry images that use a Google Cloud Storage bucket by setting public access prevention.
