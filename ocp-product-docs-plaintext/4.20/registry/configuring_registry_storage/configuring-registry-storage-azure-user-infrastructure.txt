# Configuring the registry for Azure user-provisioned infrastructure



# Configuring a secret for the Image Registry Operator

In addition to the configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io and ConfigMap
resources, configuration is provided to the Operator by a separate secret
resource located within the openshift-image-registry namespace.

The image-registry-private-configuration-user secret provides
credentials needed for storage access and management. It overrides the default
credentials used by the Operator, if default credentials were found.

For Azure registry storage, the secret is expected to contain one key whose value is the
contents of a credentials file provided by Azure:

* REGISTRY_STORAGE_AZURE_ACCOUNTKEY

* Create an {product-title} secret that contains the required key.

```terminal
$ oc create secret generic image-registry-private-configuration-user --from-literal=REGISTRY_STORAGE_AZURE_ACCOUNTKEY=<accountkey> --namespace openshift-image-registry
```


# Configuring registry storage for Azure

During installation, your cloud credentials are sufficient to create Azure Blob
Storage, and the Registry Operator automatically configures storage.

* A cluster on Azure with user-provisioned infrastructure.
* To configure registry storage for Azure, provide Registry Operator
cloud credentials.
* For Azure storage the secret is expected to contain one key:
* REGISTRY_STORAGE_AZURE_ACCOUNTKEY

1. Create an Azure storage container.
2. Fill in the storage configuration in configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster:

```terminal
$ oc edit configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster
```

Example configuration

```yaml
storage:
  azure:
    accountName: <storage-account-name>
    container: <container-name>
```


# Configuring registry storage for Azure Government

During installation, your cloud credentials are sufficient to create Azure Blob
Storage, and the Registry Operator automatically configures storage.

* A cluster on Azure with user-provisioned infrastructure in a government region.
* To configure registry storage for Azure, provide Registry Operator
cloud credentials.
* For Azure storage, the secret is expected to contain one key:
* REGISTRY_STORAGE_AZURE_ACCOUNTKEY

1. Create an Azure storage container.
2. Fill in the storage configuration in configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster:

```terminal
$ oc edit configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster
```

Example configuration

```yaml
storage:
  azure:
    accountName: <storage-account-name>
    container: <container-name>
    cloudName: AzureUSGovernmentCloud 1
```

cloudName is the name of the Azure cloud environment, which can be used to configure the Azure SDK with the appropriate Azure API endpoints. Defaults to AzurePublicCloud. You can also set cloudName to AzureUSGovernmentCloud, AzureChinaCloud, or AzureGermanCloud with sufficient credentials.
