# About migrating from {product-title} 3 to 4



{product-title} 4 contains new technologies and functionality that result in a cluster that is self-managing, flexible, and automated. {product-title} 4 clusters are deployed and managed very differently from {product-title} 3.

The most effective way to migrate from {product-title} 3 to 4 is by using a CI/CD pipeline to automate deployments in an application lifecycle management framework.

If you do not have a CI/CD pipeline or if you are migrating stateful applications, you can use the Migration Toolkit for Containers (MTC) to migrate your application workloads.

You can use Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes to help you import and manage your {product-title} 3 clusters easily, enforce policies, and redeploy your applications. Take advantage of the free subscription to use Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management to simplify your migration process.

To successfully transition to {product-title} 4, review the following information:
