# Diagnosing OpenShift CLI (oc) issues



# Understanding OpenShift CLI (oc) log levels

With the OpenShift CLI (oc), you can create applications and manage {product-title} projects from a terminal.

If oc command-specific issues arise, increase the oc log level to output API request, API response, and curl request details generated by the command. This provides a granular view of a particular oc command&#8217;s underlying operation, which in turn might provide insight into the nature of a failure.

oc log levels range from 1 to 10. The following table provides a list of oc log levels, along with their descriptions.



# Specifying OpenShift CLI (oc) log levels

You can investigate OpenShift CLI (oc) issues by increasing the command&#8217;s log level.

The {product-title} user&#8217;s current session token is typically included in logged curl requests where required. You can also obtain the current user&#8217;s session token manually, for use when testing aspects of an oc command&#8217;s underlying process step-by-step.

* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

* Specify the oc log level when running an oc command:

```terminal
$ oc <command> --loglevel <log_level>
```


where:
<command>:: Specifies the command you are running.
<log_level>:: Specifies the log level to apply to the command.
* To obtain the current user's session token, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc whoami -t
```

Example output

```text
sha256~RCV3Qcn7H-OEfqCGVI0CvnZ6...
```
