# Using the Insights Operator


The Insights Operator periodically gathers configuration and component failure status and, by default, reports that data every two hours to Red Hat. This information enables Red Hat to assess configuration and deeper failure data than is reported through Telemetry. Users of {product-title} can display the report in the Insights Advisor service on Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console.
* The Insights Operator is installed and enabled by default. If you need to opt out of remote health reporting, see Remote health reporting.
* For more information on using the Red Hat Lightspeed advisor service to identify issues with your cluster, see Using Red Hat Lightspeed to identify issues with your cluster.

# Configuring Insights Operator

Insights Operator configuration is a combination of the default Operator configuration and the configuration that is stored in either the insights-config ConfigMap object in the openshift-insights namespace, OR in the support secret in the openshift-config namespace.

When a ConfigMap object or support secret exists, the contained attribute values override the default Operator configuration values. If both a ConfigMap object and a support secret exist, the Operator reads the ConfigMap object.

The ConfigMap object does not exist by default, so an {product-title} cluster administrator must create it.

This example of an insights-config ConfigMap object (config.yaml configuration) shows configuration options by using standard YAML formatting.


```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: insights-config
  namespace: openshift-insights
data:
  config.yaml: |
    dataReporting:
      uploadEndpoint: https://console.redhat.com/api/ingress/v1/upload
      storagePath: /var/lib/insights-operator
      downloadEndpoint: https://console.redhat.com/api/insights-results-aggregator/v2/cluster/%s/reports
      conditionalGathererEndpoint: https://console.redhat.com/api/gathering/gathering_rules
    sca:
        disabled: false
        endpoint: https://api.openshift.com/api/accounts_mgmt/v1/entitlement_certificates
        interval: 8h0m0s
    alerting:
        disabled: false
    proxy:
        httpProxy: http://example.com
        httpsProxy: https://example.com
        noProxy: test.org
```


The following table describes the available configuration attributes:


[NOTE]
----
The insights-config ConfigMap object follows standard YAML formatting, wherein child values are below the parent attribute and indented two spaces. For the Obfuscation attribute, enter values as bulleted children of the parent attribute.
----



## Creating the insights-config ConfigMap object

This procedure describes how to create the insights-config ConfigMap object for the Insights Operator to set custom configurations.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Red Hat recommends you consult Red Hat Support before making changes to the default Insights Operator configuration.
----

* Remote health reporting is enabled, which is the default.
* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console as a user with cluster-admin role.

1. Go to Workloads -> ConfigMaps and select Project: openshift-insights.
2. Click Create ConfigMap.
3. Select Configure via: YAML view and enter your configuration preferences, for example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: insights-config
  namespace: openshift-insights
data:
  config.yaml: |
    dataReporting:
      obfuscation:
        - networking
        - workload_names
    sca:
      disabled: false
      interval: 2h
    alerting:
       disabled: false
binaryData: {}
immutable: false
```

4. Optional: Select Form view and enter the necessary information that way.
5. In the ConfigMap Name field, enter insights-config.
6. In the Key field, enter config.yaml.
7. For the Value field, either browse for a file to drag and drop into the field or enter your configuration parameters manually.
8. Click Create and you can see the ConfigMap object and configuration information.

# Understanding Insights Operator alerts

The Insights Operator declares alerts through the Prometheus monitoring system to the Alertmanager. You can view these alerts in the Alerting UI in the {product-title} web console by using one of the following methods:

* In the Administrator perspective, click Observe -> Alerting.
* In the Developer perspective, click Observe -> <project_name> -> Alerts tab.

Currently, Insights Operator sends the following alerts when the conditions are met:



## Disabling Insights Operator alerts

To prevent the Insights Operator from sending alerts to the cluster Prometheus instance, you create or edit the insights-config ConfigMap object.


[NOTE]
----
Previously, a cluster administrator would create or edit the Insights Operator configuration using a support secret in the openshift-config namespace. Red Hat Lightspeed now supports the creation of a ConfigMap object to configure the Operator. The Operator gives preference to the config map configuration over the support secret if both exist.
----

If the insights-config ConfigMap object does not exist, you must create it when you first add custom configurations. Note that configurations within the ConfigMap object take precedence over the default settings defined in the config/pod.yaml file.

* Remote health reporting is enabled, which is the default.
* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console as cluster-admin.
* The insights-config ConfigMap object exists in the openshift-insights namespace.

1. Go to Workloads -> ConfigMaps and select Project: openshift-insights.
2. Click on the insights-config ConfigMap object to open it.
3. Click Actions and select Edit ConfigMap.
4. Click the YAML view radio button.
5. In the file, set the alerting attribute to disabled: true.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
# ...
data:
  config.yaml: |
    alerting:
      disabled: true
# ...
```

6. Click Save. The insights-config config-map details page opens.
7. Verify that the value of the config.yaml alerting attribute is set to disabled: true.

After you save the changes, Insights Operator no longer sends alerts to the cluster Prometheus instance.

## Enabling Insights Operator alerts

When alerts are disabled, the Insights Operator no longer sends alerts to the cluster Prometheus instance. You can reenable them.


[NOTE]
----
Previously, a cluster administrator would create or edit the Insights Operator configuration using a support secret in the openshift-config namespace. Red Hat Lightspeed now supports the creation of a ConfigMap object to configure the Insights Operator. The Insights Operator gives preference to the config map configuration over the support secret if both exist.
----

* Remote health reporting is enabled, which is the default.
* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console as cluster-admin.
* The insights-config ConfigMap object exists in the openshift-insights namespace.

1. Go to Workloads -> ConfigMaps and select Project: openshift-insights.
2. Click on the insights-config ConfigMap object to open it.
3. Click Actions and select Edit ConfigMap.
4. Click the YAML view radio button.
5. In the file, set the alerting attribute to disabled: false.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
# ...
data:
  config.yaml: |
    alerting:
      disabled: false
# ...
```

6. Click Save. The insights-config config-map details page opens.
7. Verify that the value of the config.yaml alerting attribute is set to disabled: false.

After you save the changes, Insights Operator again sends alerts to the cluster Prometheus instance.

# Downloading your Insights Operator archive

Insights Operator stores gathered data in an archive located in the openshift-insights namespace of your cluster. You can download and review the data that is gathered by the Insights Operator.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

1. Find the name of the running pod for the Insights Operator:

```terminal
$ oc get pods --namespace=openshift-insights -o custom-columns=:metadata.name --no-headers  --field-selector=status.phase=Running
```

2. Copy the recent data archives collected by the Insights Operator:

```terminal
$ oc cp openshift-insights/<insights_operator_pod_name>:/var/lib/insights-operator ./insights-data 1
```

Replace <insights_operator_pod_name> with the pod name output from the preceding command.

The recent Insights Operator archives are now available in the insights-data directory.

# Running an Insights Operator gather operation on-demand

Instead of waiting for the next periodic data gather operation, you can run a custom on-demand Insights Operator data gather operation by using the {product-title} web console or command-line interface (CLI).

A periodic data gather operation uses the InsightsDataGather custom resource definition (CRD) for configuration instructions, whereas an on-demand equivalent requires a DataGather CRD to be configured.

An on-demand DataGather operation is:

* Useful for one-off data collections that require different CRD configurations to the periodic data gathering (InsightsDataGather) specification.
* Independent from the periodic data gathering. When you create an on-demand DataGather CRD, the configuration is independent from the InsightsDataGather CRD specification of your periodic data gathering job.

Custom specification options

You can optionally customize the following items for the on-demand data gather operation:

* Enable and define data obfuscation: By defining the DataGather dataPolicy specification, you can enable additional obfuscation of the Red Hat Lightspeed archive data, for example, the IP address or workload names.
* Enable persistant storage: By default, the Insights Operator uses ephemeral storage, which means that a new pod will be created for each gather operation and the history of gather operations and data collected is not retained. You can switch to persistent storage to retain the data and history for up to the last 10 gather operations by defining the DataGather storage specification in the CRD.
* Exclude specific data gather operations:  You can choose to disable specific gather operations from running by defining the DataGather gatherers specification. For example, you can choose to disable the cluster authentication operation or the workload data operation.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Excluding gather operations from the default list might reduce or limit the  recommendations offered by the Red Hat Lightspeed advisor service for your cluster.
----

If you do not configure any custom specification options in the DataGather CRD, the default Insights Operator data collection job will run. This means that all gather operations will run, the collected data will be unobfuscated and the archive file will not be retained.

When you run a gather operation on-demand, any configuration that was previously applied to disable Insights Operator gather operations for your cluster will be overridden.


[IMPORTANT]
----
{FeatureName} is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
----


[NOTE]
----
If you enable Technology Preview in your cluster, the Insights Operator runs gather operations in individual pods. This is part of the Technology Preview feature set for the Insights Operator and supports the new data gathering features.
----

## Viewing Insights Operator gather durations

You can view the time it takes for the Insights Operator to gather the information contained in the archive. This helps you to understand Insights Operator resource usage and issues with Red&#160;Hat Lightspeed Advisor.

* A recent copy of your Insights Operator archive.

1. From your archive, open /insights-operator/gathers.json.

The file contains a list of Insights Operator gather operations:

```json
    {
      "name": "clusterconfig/authentication",
      "duration_in_ms": 730, 1
      "records_count": 1,
      "errors": null,
      "panic": null
    }
```

duration_in_ms is the amount of time in milliseconds for each gather operation.
2. Inspect each gather operation for abnormalities.

## Gathering data on demand with the Insights Operator from the web console

You can run a custom Insights Operator gather operation on-demand from the {product-title} web console. An on-demand DataGather operation is useful for one-off data collections that require different configurations to the periodic data gathering (InsightsDataGather) specification.

Use the following procedure to create a DataGather custom resource definition (CRD), and then run the data gather operation on demand from the web console.

* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console as a user with the cluster-admin role.

1. On the console, select Administration > CustomResourceDefinitions.
2. On the CustomResourceDefinitions page, in the Search by name field, find the DataGather resource definition, and then click it.
3. On the CustomResourceDefinition details page, click the Instances tab.
4. Click Create DataGather.
5. To create a new DataGather operation where all gather operations will run, complete the following YAML specification, and then save your changes.

```yaml
apiVersion: insights.openshift.io/v1alpha2
kind: DataGather
metadata:
  name: <your_data_gather>
spec:
# Gatherers configuration
  gatherers:
    mode: All # Options: All, Custom
# ...
```


[IMPORTANT]
----
* The name you specify for your gather operation, <your_data_gather>, must be unique and must not include a prefix of periodic-gathering- because this string is reserved for other administrative operations and might impact the intended gather operation.
* If the spec of DataGather CRD is undefined, the default Insights Operator data collection job will run. This means that all gather operations will run, the collected data will be unobfuscated and the archive file will not be retained.
----
6. Optional: To customize the data gather operation, you can configure any of the following options in your DataGather YAML file:
* To disable specific gatherers, change the value of mode to Custom, and then specify the individual gatherer that you intend to disable. For example, to disable the workload gatherer, add the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: insights.openshift.io/v1alpha2
kind: DataGather
metadata:
  name: <your_data_gather>
spec:
    # Gatherers configuration
  gatherers:
    mode: Custom  # Options: All, Custom
    custom:
      configs:
        # Essential cluster configuration gatherers
        - name: clusterconfig/authentication
          state: Enabled
        - name: clusterconfig/clusteroperators
          state: Enabled
        - name: workloads
          state: Disabled
```

* To enable persistent storage to retain the data archive file and history for up to the last 10 data gathering jobs, define the storage specification. Set type to PersistentVolume, and define the mountPath and name of the volume, as outlined in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: insights.openshift.io/v1alpha2
kind: DataGather
metadata:
  name: <your_data_gather>
spec:
  storage:
    type: PersistentVolume
    mountPath: /data
    persistentVolume:
      claim:
        name: on-demand-gather-pvc
```


[IMPORTANT]
----
Ensure that the volume name specified matches the existing PersistentVolumeClaim value in the openshift-insights namespace. For more information, see Persistent volume claims.
----
* To enable data obfuscation, define the dataPolicy key and required values. For example, to obfuscate IP addresses and workload names, add the following configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: insights.openshift.io/v1alpha2
kind: DataGather
metadata:
  name: <your_data_gather>
spec:
  dataPolicy:
    - ObfuscateNetworking
    - WorkloadNames
```


1. On the console, select to Workloads > Pods.
2. On the Pods page, go to the Project pull-down menu, and then select Show default projects.
3. Select the openshift-insights project from the Project pull-down menu.
4. Check that your new gather operation is prefixed with your chosen name under the list of pods in the openshift-insights project. Upon completion, the Insights Operator automatically uploads the data to Red Hat for processing.

## Gathering data on demand with the Insights Operator from the OpenShift CLI

You can run a custom Insights Operator gather operation on-demand from the  {product-title} command-line interface (CLI).
An on-demand DataGather operation is useful for one-off data collections that require different configurations to the periodic data gathering (InsightsDataGather) specification.

Use the following procedure to create a DataGather custom resource definition (CRD), and then run the data gather operation on demand from the CLI.

* You are logged in to {product-title} as a user with the cluster-admin role.

1. Create a YAML file with the following DataGather specification:

```yaml
apiVersion: insights.openshift.io/v1alpha2
kind: DataGather
metadata:
  name: <your_data_gather>
spec:
# Gatherers configuration
  gatherers:
    mode: All # Options: All, Custom
# ...
```


[IMPORTANT]
----
* The name you specify for your gather operation, <your_data_gather>, must be unique and must not include a prefix of periodic-gathering- because this string is reserved for other administrative operations and might impact the intended gather operation.
* If the spec of DataGather CRD is undefined, the default Insights Operator data collection job will run. This means that all gather operations will run, the collected data will be unobfuscated and the archive file will not be retained.
----
2. Optional: To customize the data gather operation, you can configure any of the following options in your DataGather YAML file:
* To disable specific gatherers, change the value of mode to Custom, and then specify the individual gatherer that you intend to disable. For example, to disable the workload gatherer, add the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: insights.openshift.io/v1alpha2
kind: DataGather
metadata:
  name: <your_data_gather>
spec:
    # Gatherers configuration
  gatherers:
    mode: Custom  # Options: All, Custom
    custom:
      configs:
        # Essential cluster configuration gatherers
        - name: clusterconfig/authentication
          state: Enabled
        - name: clusterconfig/clusteroperators
          state: Enabled
        - name: workloads
          state: Disabled
```

* To enable persistent storage to retain the data archive file and history for up to the last 10 data gathering jobs, define the storage specification. Set type to PersistentVolume, and define the mountPath and name of the volume, as outlined in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: insights.openshift.io/v1alpha2
kind: DataGather
metadata:
  name: <your_data_gather>
spec:
  storage:
    type: PersistentVolume
    mountPath: /data
    persistentVolume:
      claim:
        name: on-demand-gather-pvc
```


[IMPORTANT]
----
Ensure that the volume name specified matches the existing PersistentVolumeClaim value in the openshift-insights namespace. For more information, see Persistent volume claims.
----
* To enable data obfuscation, define the dataPolicy key and required values. For example, to obfuscate IP addresses and workload names, add the following configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: insights.openshift.io/v1alpha2
kind: DataGather
metadata:
  name: <your_data_gather>
spec:
  dataPolicy:
    - ObfuscateNetworking
    - WorkloadNames
```

3. On the {product-title} CLI, enter the following command to run the gather operation:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <your_data_gather_definition>.yaml
```


* Check that your new gather operation is prefixed with your chosen name under the list of pods in the openshift-insights project. Upon completion, the Insights Operator automatically uploads the data to Red Hat for processing.

* Insights Operator Gathered Data GitHub repository

## Disabling the Insights Operator periodic gather operations

You can optionally disable the periodic InsightsDataGather operations that the Insights Operator runs every 2 hours by default. Disabling the periodic data gather operations increases privacy for your organization as Insights Operator will no longer gather and send Red&#160;Hat Lightspeed cluster reports to Red&#160;Hat.

Disabling gather operations will also disable Red&#160;Hat Lightspeed analysis and recommendations for your cluster without affecting other core functions that require communication with Red&#160;Hat such as cluster transfers.

You can view a list of attempted gather operations for your cluster from the /insights-operator/gathers.json file in your Insights Operator archive. Be aware that some gather operations occur only when certain conditions are met and might not show in your most recent archive.


[IMPORTANT]

kind: InsightsDataGather
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
# Gatherers configuration
  gatherers:
    mode: None # Options: All, None, Custom
```

* To disable individual gather operations, under gatherers, set the mode to Custom and then specify the individual gatherer that you intend to disable. For example, to disable the workload gatherer, define the following specification:

```yaml
apiVersion: insights.openshift.io/v1alpha2
kind: InsightsDataGather
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
    # Gatherers configuration
  gatherers:
    mode: Custom  # Options: All, None, Custom
    custom:
      configs:
        # Essential cluster configuration gatherers
        - name: clusterconfig/authentication
          state: Enabled
        - name: clusterconfig/clusteroperators
          state: Enabled
        - name: workloads
          state: Disabled
```

6. Click Save.

After you save the changes, the Insights Operator gather configurations are updated and the operations that you disabled in the configuration will no longer occur.


[NOTE]
----
Disabling gather operations restricts the ability of the Red Hat Lightspeed advisor service to offer effective recommendations for your cluster.
----

## Re-enabling the Insights Operator periodic gather operations

If you disabled the default InsightsDataGather data gather operations, you can enable them again so that the Insights Operator resumes the periodic data collection, and sends the resulting Red&#160;Hat Lightspeed cluster reports to Red&#160;Hat.

# Obfuscating Deployment Validation Operator data

By default, when you install the Deployment Validation Operator (DVO), the name and unique identifier (UID) of a resource are included in the data that is captured and processed by the Insights Operator for {product-title}.
If you are a cluster administrator, you can configure the Insights Operator to obfuscate data from the Deployment Validation Operator (DVO).
For example, you can obfuscate workload names in the archive file that is then sent to Red&#160;Hat.

To obfuscate the name of resources, you must manually set the obfuscation attribute in the insights-config ConfigMap object to include the workload_names value, as outlined in the following procedure.

* Remote health reporting is enabled, which is the default.
* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console with the "cluster-admin" role.
* The insights-config ConfigMap object exists in the openshift-insights namespace.
* The cluster is self managed and the Deployment Validation Operator is installed.

1. Go to Workloads -> ConfigMaps and select Project: openshift-insights.
2. Click the insights-config ConfigMap object to open it.
3. Click Actions and select Edit ConfigMap.
4. Click the YAML view radio button.
5. In the file, set the obfuscation attribute with the workload_names value.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
# ...
data:
  config.yaml: |
    dataReporting:
      obfuscation:
        - workload_names
# ...
```

6. Click Save. The insights-config config-map details page opens.
7. Verify that the value of the config.yaml obfuscation attribute is set to - workload_names.
