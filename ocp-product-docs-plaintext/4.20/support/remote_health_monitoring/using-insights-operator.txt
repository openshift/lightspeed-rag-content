# Using the Insights Operator


The Insights Operator periodically gathers configuration and component failure status and, by default, reports that data every two hours to Red Hat. This information enables Red Hat to assess configuration and deeper failure data than is reported through Telemetry. Users of {product-title} can display the report in the Insights Advisor service on Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console.
* The Insights Operator is installed and enabled by default. If you need to opt out of remote health reporting, see Remote health reporting.
* For more information on using the Insights advisor service to identify issues with your cluster, see Using Insights to identify issues with your cluster.

# Configuring Insights Operator

Insights Operator configuration is a combination of the default Operator configuration and the configuration that is stored in either the insights-config ConfigMap object in the openshift-insights namespace, OR in the support secret in the openshift-config namespace.

When a ConfigMap object or support secret exists, the contained attribute values override the default Operator configuration values. If both a ConfigMap object and a support secret exist, the Operator reads the ConfigMap object.

The ConfigMap object does not exist by default, so an {product-title} cluster administrator must create it.

This example of an insights-config ConfigMap object (config.yaml configuration) shows configuration options by using standard YAML formatting.

![Example of Insights Operator ConfigMap object]

The following table describes the available configuration attributes:


[NOTE]
----
The insights-config ConfigMap object follows standard YAML formatting, wherein child values are below the parent attribute and indented two spaces. For the Obfuscation attribute, enter values as bulleted children of the parent attribute.

## Creating the insights-config ConfigMap object

This procedure describes how to create the insights-config ConfigMap object for the Insights Operator to set custom configurations.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Red Hat recommends you consult Red Hat Support before making changes to the default Insights Operator configuration.
----

* Remote health reporting is enabled, which is the default.
* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console as a user with cluster-admin role.

1. Go to Workloads -> ConfigMaps and select Project: openshift-insights.
2. Click Create ConfigMap.
3. Select Configure via: YAML view and enter your configuration preferences, for example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: insights-config
  namespace: openshift-insights
data:
  config.yaml: |
    dataReporting:
      obfuscation:
        - networking
        - workload_names
    sca:
      disabled: false
      interval: 2h
    alerting:
       disabled: false
binaryData: {}
immutable: false
```

4. Optional: Select Form view and enter the necessary information that way.
5. In the ConfigMap Name field, enter insights-config.
6. In the Key field, enter config.yaml.
7. For the Value field, either browse for a file to drag and drop into the field or enter your configuration parameters manually.
8. Click Create and you can see the ConfigMap object and configuration information.

# Understanding Insights Operator alerts

The Insights Operator declares alerts through the Prometheus monitoring system to the Alertmanager. You can view these alerts in the Alerting UI in the {product-title} web console by using one of the following methods:

* In the Administrator perspective, click Observe -> Alerting.
* In the Developer perspective, click Observe -> <project_name> -> Alerts tab.

Currently, Insights Operator sends the following alerts when the conditions are met:



## Disabling Insights Operator alerts

To prevent the Insights Operator from sending alerts to the cluster Prometheus instance, you create or edit the insights-config ConfigMap object.


[NOTE]
----
Previously, a cluster administrator would create or edit the Insights Operator configuration using a support secret in the openshift-config namespace. Red Hat Insights now supports the creation of a ConfigMap object to configure the Operator. The Operator gives preference to the config map configuration over the support secret if both exist.
----

If the insights-config ConfigMap object does not exist, you must create it when you first add custom configurations. Note that configurations within the ConfigMap object take precedence over the default settings defined in the config/pod.yaml file.

* Remote health reporting is enabled, which is the default.
* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console as cluster-admin.
* The insights-config ConfigMap object exists in the openshift-insights namespace.

1. Go to Workloads -> ConfigMaps and select Project: openshift-insights.
2. Click on the insights-config ConfigMap object to open it.
3. Click Actions and select Edit ConfigMap.
4. Click the YAML view radio button.
5. In the file, set the alerting attribute to disabled: true.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
# ...
data:
  config.yaml: |
    alerting:
      disabled: true
# ...
```

6. Click Save. The insights-config config-map details page opens.
7. Verify that the value of the config.yaml alerting attribute is set to disabled: true.

After you save the changes, Insights Operator no longer sends alerts to the cluster Prometheus instance.

## Enabling Insights Operator alerts

When alerts are disabled, the Insights Operator no longer sends alerts to the cluster Prometheus instance. You can reenable them.


[NOTE]
----
Previously, a cluster administrator would create or edit the Insights Operator configuration using a support secret in the openshift-config namespace. Red Hat Insights now supports the creation of a ConfigMap object to configure the Operator. The Operator gives preference to the config map configuration over the support secret if both exist.
----

* Remote health reporting is enabled, which is the default.
* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console as cluster-admin.
* The insights-config ConfigMap object exists in the openshift-insights namespace.

1. Go to Workloads -> ConfigMaps and select Project: openshift-insights.
2. Click on the insights-config ConfigMap object to open it.
3. Click Actions and select Edit ConfigMap.
4. Click the YAML view radio button.
5. In the file, set the alerting attribute to disabled: false.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
# ...
data:
  config.yaml: |
    alerting:
      disabled: false
# ...
```

6. Click Save. The insights-config config-map details page opens.
7. Verify that the value of the config.yaml alerting attribute is set to disabled: false.

After you save the changes, Insights Operator again sends alerts to the cluster Prometheus instance.

# Downloading your Insights Operator archive

Insights Operator stores gathered data in an archive located in the openshift-insights namespace of your cluster. You can download and review the data that is gathered by the Insights Operator.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

1. Find the name of the running pod for the Insights Operator:

```terminal
$ oc get pods --namespace=openshift-insights -o custom-columns=:metadata.name --no-headers  --field-selector=status.phase=Running
```

2. Copy the recent data archives collected by the Insights Operator:

```terminal
$ oc cp openshift-insights/<insights_operator_pod_name>:/var/lib/insights-operator ./insights-data 1
```

Replace <insights_operator_pod_name> with the pod name output from the preceding command.

The recent Insights Operator archives are now available in the insights-data directory.

# Running an Insights Operator gather operation

You can run Insights Operator data gather operations on demand. The following procedures describe how to run the default list of gather operations using the OpenShift web console or CLI. You can customize the on demand gather function to exclude any gather operations you choose. Disabling gather operations from the default list degrades Insights Advisor&#8217;s ability to offer effective recommendations for your cluster. If you have previously disabled Insights Operator gather operations in your cluster, this procedure will override those parameters.

## Viewing Insights Operator gather durations

You can view the time it takes for the Insights Operator to gather the information contained in the archive. This helps you to understand Insights Operator resource usage and issues with Insights Advisor.

* A recent copy of your Insights Operator archive.

1. From your archive, open /insights-operator/gathers.json.

The file contains a list of Insights Operator gather operations:

```json
    {
      "name": "clusterconfig/authentication",
      "duration_in_ms": 730, 1
      "records_count": 1,
      "errors": null,
      "panic": null
    }
```

duration_in_ms is the amount of time in milliseconds for each gather operation.
2. Inspect each gather operation for abnormalities.

## Running an Insights Operator gather operation from the web console

To collect data, you can run an Insights Operator gather operation by using the {product-title} web console.

* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console as a user with the cluster-admin role.

1. On the console, select Administration -> CustomResourceDefinitions.
2. On the CustomResourceDefinitions page, in the Search by name field, find the DataGather resource definition, and then click it.
3. On the CustomResourceDefinition details page, click the Instances tab.
4. Click Create DataGather.
5. To create a new DataGather operation, edit the following configuration file and then save your changes.

```yaml
apiVersion: insights.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataGather
metadata:
  name: <your_data_gather> 1
spec:
 gatherers: 2
   - name: workloads
     state: Disabled
```

Under metadata, replace <your_data_gather> with a unique name for the gather operation.
Under gatherers, specify any individual gather operations that you intend to disable. In the example provided, workloads is the only data gather operation that is disabled and all of the other default operations are set to run.
When the spec parameter is empty, all of the default gather operations run.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not add a prefix of periodic-gathering- to the name of your gather operation because this string is reserved for other administrative operations and might impact the intended gather operation.
----

1. On the console, select to Workloads -> Pods.
2. On the Pods page, go to the Project pull-down menu, and then select Show default projects.
3. Select the openshift-insights project from the Project pull-down menu.
4. Check that your new gather operation is prefixed with your chosen name under the list of pods in the openshift-insights project. Upon completion, the Insights Operator automatically uploads the data to Red Hat for processing.

## Running an Insights Operator gather operation from the OpenShift CLI

You can run an Insights Operator gather operation by using the {product-title} command-line interface.

* You are logged in to {product-title} as a user with the cluster-admin role.

* Enter the following command to run the gather operation:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <your_datagather_definition>.yaml
```


Replace <your_datagather_definition>.yaml with a configuration file that contains the following parameters:

```yaml
apiVersion: insights.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataGather
metadata:
  name: <your_data_gather> 1
spec:
 gatherers: 2
   - name: workloads
     state: Disabled
```

Under metadata, replace <your_data_gather> with a unique name for the gather operation.
Under gatherers, specify any individual gather operations that you intend to disable. In the example provided, workloads is the only data gather operation that is disabled and all of the other default operations are set to run.
When the spec parameter is empty, all of the default gather operations run.


[IMPORTANT]

## Disabling the Insights Operator gather operations

You can disable the Insights Operator gather operations. Disabling the gather operations gives you the ability to increase privacy for your organization as Insights Operator will no longer gather and send Insights cluster reports to Red Hat. This will disable Insights analysis and recommendations for your cluster without affecting other core functions that require communication with Red Hat such as cluster transfers. You can view a list of attempted gather operations for your cluster from the /insights-operator/gathers.json file in your Insights Operator archive. Be aware that some gather operations only occur when certain conditions are met and might not appear in your most recent archive.

# Obfuscating Deployment Validation Operator data

By default, when you install the Deployment Validation Operator (DVO), the name and unique identifier (UID) of a resource are included in the data that is captured and processed by the Insights Operator for {product-title}.
If you are a cluster administrator, you can configure the Insights Operator to obfuscate data from the Deployment Validation Operator (DVO).
For example, you can obfuscate workload names in the archive file that is then sent to Red&#160;Hat.

To obfuscate the name of resources, you must manually set the obfuscation attribute in the insights-config ConfigMap object to include the workload_names value, as outlined in the following procedure.

* Remote health reporting is enabled, which is the default.
* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console with the "cluster-admin" role.
* The insights-config ConfigMap object exists in the openshift-insights namespace.
* The cluster is self managed and the Deployment Validation Operator is installed.

1. Go to Workloads -> ConfigMaps and select Project: openshift-insights.
2. Click the insights-config ConfigMap object to open it.
3. Click Actions and select Edit ConfigMap.
4. Click the YAML view radio button.
5. In the file, set the obfuscation attribute with the workload_names value.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
# ...
data:
  config.yaml: |
    dataReporting:
      obfuscation:
        - workload_names
# ...
```

6. Click Save. The insights-config config-map details page opens.
7. Verify that the value of the config.yaml obfuscation attribute is set to - workload_names.
