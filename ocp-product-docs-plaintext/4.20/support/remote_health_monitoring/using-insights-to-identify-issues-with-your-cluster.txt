# Using Insights to identify issues with your cluster


Insights repeatedly analyzes the data Insights Operator sends, which includes workload recommendations from Deployment Validation Operator (DVO). Users of {product-title} can display the results in the Insights Advisor service on Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console.

# About Red Hat Insights Advisor for {product-title}

You can use the Insights advisor service to assess and monitor the health of your {product-title} clusters. Whether you are concerned about individual clusters, or with your whole infrastructure, it is important to be aware of the exposure of your cluster infrastructure to issues that can affect service availability, fault tolerance, performance, or security.

If the cluster has the Deployment Validation Operator (DVO) installed the recommendations also highlight workloads whose configuration might lead to cluster health issues.

The results of the Insights analysis are available in the Insights advisor service on Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console. In the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console, you can perform the following actions:

* View clusters and workloads affected by specific recommendations.
* Use robust filtering capabilities to refine your results to those recommendations.
* Learn more about individual recommendations, details about the risks they present, and get resolutions tailored to your individual clusters.
* Share results with other stakeholders.

* Using the Deployment Validation Operator in your Red Hat Insights for OpenShift workflow

# Understanding Insights Advisor recommendations

The Insights advisor service bundles information about various cluster states and component configurations that can negatively affect the service availability, fault tolerance, performance, or security of your clusters and workloads. This information set is called a recommendation in the Insights advisor service. Recommendations for clusters includes the following information:

* Name: A concise description of the recommendation
* Added: When the recommendation was published to the Insights Advisor service archive
* Category: Whether the issue has the potential to negatively affect service availability, fault tolerance, performance, or security
* Total risk: A value derived from the likelihood that the condition will negatively affect your cluster or workload, and the impact on operations if that were to happen
* Clusters: A list of clusters on which a recommendation is detected
* Description: A brief synopsis of the issue, including how it affects your clusters

# Displaying potential issues with your cluster

This section describes how to display the Insights report in Insights Advisor on OpenShift Cluster Manager.

Note that Insights repeatedly analyzes your cluster and shows the latest results. These results can change, for example, if you fix an issue or a new issue has been detected.

* Your cluster is registered on OpenShift Cluster Manager.
* Remote health reporting is enabled, which is the default.
* You are logged in to OpenShift Cluster Manager.

1. Navigate to Advisor -> Recommendations on OpenShift Cluster Manager.

Depending on the result, the Insights advisor service displays one of the following:
* No matching recommendations found, if Insights did not identify any issues.
* A list of issues Insights has detected, grouped by risk (low, moderate, important, and critical).
* No clusters yet, if Insights has not yet analyzed the cluster. The analysis starts shortly after the cluster has been installed, registered, and connected to the internet.
2. If any issues are displayed, click the > icon in front of the entry for more details.

Depending on the issue, the details can also contain a link to more information from Red Hat about the issue.

# Displaying all Insights advisor service recommendations

The Recommendations view, by default, only displays the recommendations that are detected on your clusters. However, you can view all of the recommendations in the advisor service&#8217;s archive.

* Remote health reporting is enabled, which is the default.
* Your cluster is registered on Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console.
* You are logged in to OpenShift Cluster Manager.

1. Navigate to Advisor -> Recommendations on OpenShift Cluster Manager.
2. Click the X icons next to the Clusters Impacted and Status filters.

You can now browse through all of the potential recommendations for your cluster.

# Advisor recommendation filters

The Insights advisor service can return a large number of recommendations. To focus on your most critical recommendations, you can apply filters to the Advisor recommendations list to remove low-priority recommendations.

By default, filters are set to only show enabled recommendations that are impacting one or more clusters. To view all or disabled recommendations in the Insights library, you can customize the filters.

To apply a filter, select a filter type and then set its value based on the options that are available in the drop-down list. You can apply multiple filters to the list of recommendations.

You can set the following filter types:

* Name: Search for a recommendation by name.
* Total risk: Select one or more values from Critical, Important, Moderate, and Low indicating the likelihood and the severity of a negative impact on a cluster.
* Impact: Select one or more values from Critical, High, Medium, and Low indicating the potential impact to the continuity of cluster operations.
* Likelihood: Select one or more values from Critical, High, Medium, and Low indicating the potential for a negative impact to a cluster if the recommendation comes to fruition.
* Category: Select one or more categories from Service Availability, Performance, Fault Tolerance, Security, and Best Practice to focus your attention on.
* Status: Click a radio button to show enabled recommendations (default), disabled recommendations, or all recommendations.
* Clusters impacted: Set the filter to show recommendations currently impacting one or more clusters, non-impacting recommendations, or all recommendations.
* Risk of change: Select one or more values from High, Moderate, Low, and Very low indicating the risk that the implementation of the resolution could have on cluster operations.

## Filtering Insights advisor service recommendations

As an {product-title} cluster manager, you can filter the recommendations that are displayed on the recommendations list. By applying filters, you can reduce the number of reported recommendations and concentrate on your highest priority recommendations.

The following procedure demonstrates how to set and remove Category filters; however, the procedure is applicable to any of the filter types and respective values.

You are logged in to the OpenShift Cluster Manager in the Hybrid Cloud Console.

1. Go to OpenShift > Advisor > Recommendations.
2. In the main, filter-type drop-down list, select the Category filter type.
3. Expand the filter-value drop-down list and select the checkbox next to each category of recommendation you want to view. Leave the checkboxes for unnecessary categories clear.
4. Optional: Add additional filters to further refine the list.

Only recommendations from the selected categories are shown in the list.

* After applying filters, you can view the updated recommendations list. The applied filters are added next to the default filters.

## Removing filters from Insights advisor service recommendations

You can apply multiple filters to the list of recommendations. When ready, you can remove them individually or completely reset them.

* Click the X icon next to each filter, including the default filters, to remove them individually.

* Click Reset filters to remove only the filters that you applied, leaving the default filters in place.

# Disabling Insights advisor service recommendations
