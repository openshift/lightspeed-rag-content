# Importing simple content access entitlements with Insights Operator


Insights Operator periodically imports your simple content access entitlements from OpenShift Cluster Manager and stores them in the etc-pki-entitlement secret in the openshift-config-managed namespace. Simple content access is a capability in Red Hat subscription tools which simplifies the behavior of the entitlement tooling. This feature makes it easier to consume the content provided by your Red Hat subscriptions without the complexity of configuring subscription tooling.

[NOTE]
----
Previously, a cluster administrator would create or edit the Insights Operator configuration using a support secret in the openshift-config namespace. Red Hat Insights now supports the creation of a ConfigMap object to configure the Operator. The Operator gives preference to the config map configuration over the support secret if both exist.
----
The Insights Operator imports simple content access entitlements every eight hours, but can be configured or disabled using the insights-config ConfigMap object in the openshift-insights namespace.

[NOTE]
----
Simple content access must be enabled in Red Hat Subscription Management for the importing to function.

* See About simple content access in the Red Hat Subscription Central documentation, for more information about simple content access.
* See Using Red Hat subscriptions in builds for more information about using simple content access entitlements in {product-title} builds.

# Configuring simple content access import interval

You can configure how often the Insights Operator imports the simple content access (sca) entitlements by using the insights-config ConfigMap object in the openshift-insights namespace. The entitlement import normally occurs every eight hours, but you can shorten this sca interval if you update your simple content access configuration in the insights-config ConfigMap object.

This procedure describes how to update the import interval to two hours (2h). You can specify hours (h) or hours and minutes, for example: 2h30m.

* Remote health reporting is enabled, which is the default.
* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* The insights-config ConfigMap object exists in the openshift-insights namespace.

1. Go to Workloads -> ConfigMaps and select Project: openshift-insights.
2. Click on the insights-config ConfigMap object to open it.
3. Click Actions and select Edit ConfigMap.
4. Click the YAML view radio button.
5. Set the sca attribute in the file to interval: 2h to import content every two hours.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
# ...
data:
  config.yaml: |
    sca:
      interval: 2h
# ...
```

6. Click Save. The insights-config config-map details page opens.
7. Verify that the value of the config.yaml sca attribute is set to interval: 2h.

# Disabling simple content access import

You can disable the importing of simple content access entitlements by using the insights-config ConfigMap object in the openshift-insights namespace.

* Remote health reporting is enabled, which is the default.
* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console as cluster-admin.
* The insights-config ConfigMap object exists in the openshift-insights namespace.

1. Go to Workloads -> ConfigMaps and select Project: openshift-insights.
2. Click on the insights-config ConfigMap object to open it.
3. Click Actions and select Edit ConfigMap.
4. Click the YAML view radio button.
5. In the file, set the sca attribute to disabled: true.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
# ...
data:
  config.yaml: |
    sca:
      disabled: true
# ...
```

6. Click Save. The insights-config config-map details page opens.
7. Verify that the value of the config.yaml sca attribute is set to disabled: true.

# Enabling a previously disabled simple content access import

If the importing of simple content access entitlements is disabled, the Insights Operator does not import simple content access entitlements. You can change this behavior.

* Remote health reporting is enabled, which is the default.
* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* The insights-config ConfigMap object exists in the openshift-insights namespace.

1. Go to Workloads -> ConfigMaps and select Project: openshift-insights.
2. Click on the insights-config ConfigMap object to open it.
3. Click Actions and select Edit ConfigMap.
4. Click the YAML view radio button.
5. In the file, set the sca attribute to disabled: false.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
# ...
data:
  config.yaml: |
    sca:
      disabled: false
# ...
```

6. Click Save. The insights-config config-map details page opens.
7. Verify that the value of the config.yaml sca attribute is set to disabled: false.
