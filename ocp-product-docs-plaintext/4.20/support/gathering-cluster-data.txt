# Gathering data about your cluster


When opening a support case, it is helpful to provide debugging
information about your cluster to Red Hat Support.
It is recommended to provide:
* Data gathered using the oc adm must-gather command
* The  unique cluster ID

# About the must-gather tool

The oc adm must-gather CLI command collects the information from your cluster that is most likely needed for debugging issues, including:

* Resource definitions
* Service logs

By default, the oc adm must-gather command uses the default plugin image and writes into ./must-gather.local.

Alternatively, you can collect specific information by running the command with the appropriate arguments as described in the following sections:

* To collect data related to one or more specific features, use the --image argument with an image, as listed in a following section.

For example:

```terminal
$ oc adm must-gather \
  --image=registry.redhat.io/container-native-virtualization/cnv-must-gather-rhel9:v4.19.0
```

* To collect the audit logs, use the - /usr/bin/gather_audit_logs argument, as described in a following section.

For example:

```terminal
$ oc adm must-gather -- /usr/bin/gather_audit_logs
```


[NOTE]
----
* Audit logs are not collected as part of the default set of information to reduce the size of the files.
* On a Windows operating system, install the cwRsync client and add to the PATH  variable for use with the oc rsync command.
----

When you run oc adm must-gather, a new pod with a random name is created in a new project on the cluster. The data is collected on that pod and saved in a new directory that starts with must-gather.local in the current working directory.

For example:


```terminal
NAMESPACE                      NAME                 READY   STATUS      RESTARTS      AGE
...
openshift-must-gather-5drcj    must-gather-bklx4    2/2     Running     0             72s
openshift-must-gather-5drcj    must-gather-s8sdh    2/2     Running     0             72s
...
```


Optionally, you can run the oc adm must-gather command in a specific namespace by using the --run-namespace option.

For example:


```terminal
$ oc adm must-gather --run-namespace <namespace> \
  --image=registry.redhat.io/container-native-virtualization/cnv-must-gather-rhel9:v4.19.0
```


## Gathering data about your cluster for Red Hat Support

You can gather debugging information about your cluster by using the oc adm must-gather CLI command.

If you are gathering information to debug a self-managed hosted cluster, see "Gathering information to troubleshoot hosted control planes".

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* The {product-title} CLI (oc) is installed.

1. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the must-gather data.

[NOTE]
----
If your cluster is in a disconnected environment, you must take additional steps. If your mirror registry has a trusted CA, you must first add the trusted CA to the cluster. For all clusters in disconnected environments, you must import the default must-gather image as an image stream.

```terminal
$ oc import-image is/must-gather -n openshift
```

----
2. Run the oc adm must-gather command:

```terminal
$ oc adm must-gather
```


[IMPORTANT]
----
If you are in a disconnected environment, use the --image flag as part of must-gather and point to the payload image.
----

[NOTE]
----
Because this command picks a random control plane node by default, the pod might be scheduled to a control plane node that is in the NotReady and SchedulingDisabled state.
----
1. If this command fails, for example, if you cannot schedule a pod on your cluster, then use the oc adm inspect command to gather information for particular resources.

[NOTE]
----
Contact Red Hat Support for the recommended resources to gather.
----
3. Create a compressed file from the must-gather directory that was just created in your working directory. Make sure you provide the date and cluster ID for the unique must-gather data. For more information about how to find the cluster ID, see How to find the cluster-id or name on OpenShift cluster. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

```terminal
$ tar cvaf must-gather-`date +"%m-%d-%Y-%H-%M-%S"`-<cluster_id>.tar.gz <must_gather_local_dir> 1
```

Replace <must_gather_local_dir> with the actual directory name.
4. Attach the compressed file to your support case on the the Customer Support page of the Red Hat Customer Portal.

## Must-gather flags

The flags listed in the following table are available to use with the oc adm must-gather command.



## Gathering data about specific features

You can gather debugging information about specific features by using the oc adm must-gather CLI command with the --image or --image-stream argument. The must-gather tool supports multiple images, so you can gather data about more than one feature by running a single command.




[NOTE]
----
To determine the latest version for an {product-title} component's image, see the OpenShift Operator Life Cycles web page on the Red Hat Customer Portal.
----

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* The {product-title} CLI (oc) is installed.

1. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the must-gather data.
2. Run the oc adm must-gather command with one or more --image or --image-stream arguments.

[NOTE]
----
* To collect the default must-gather data in addition to specific feature data, add the --image-stream=openshift/must-gather argument.
* For information on gathering data about the Custom Metrics Autoscaler, see the Additional resources section that follows.
----

For example, the following command gathers both the default cluster data and information specific to OpenShift Virtualization:

```terminal
$ oc adm must-gather \
  --image-stream=openshift/must-gather \ 1
  --image=registry.redhat.io/container-native-virtualization/cnv-must-gather-rhel9:v4.19.0 2
```

The default {product-title} must-gather image
The must-gather image for OpenShift Virtualization

You can use the must-gather tool with additional arguments to gather data that is specifically related to OpenShift Logging and the
Red Hat OpenShift
Logging Operator in your cluster. For OpenShift Logging, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc adm must-gather --image=$(oc -n openshift-logging get deployment.apps/cluster-logging-operator \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[?(@.name == "cluster-logging-operator")].image}')
```

3. Run the oc adm must-gather command with one or more --image or --image-stream arguments. For example, the following command gathers both the default cluster data and information specific to KubeVirt:

```terminal
$ oc adm must-gather \
 --image-stream=openshift/must-gather \ 1
 --image=quay.io/kubevirt/must-gather 2
```

The default {product-title} must-gather image
The must-gather image for KubeVirt
4. Create a compressed file from the must-gather directory that was just created in your working directory. Make sure you provide the date and cluster ID for the unique must-gather data. For more information about how to find the cluster ID, see How to find the cluster-id or name on OpenShift cluster. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

```terminal
$ tar cvaf must-gather-`date +"%m-%d-%Y-%H-%M-%S"`-<cluster_id>.tar.gz <must_gather_local_dir> 1
```

Replace <must_gather_local_dir> with the actual directory name.
5. Attach the compressed file to your support case on the the Customer Support page of the Red Hat Customer Portal.

* Gathering debugging data for the Custom Metrics Autoscaler.
* Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy

## Gathering network logs

You can gather network logs on all nodes in a cluster.

1. Run the oc adm must-gather command with - gather_network_logs:

```terminal
$ oc adm must-gather -- gather_network_logs
```


[NOTE]
----
By default, the must-gather tool collects the OVN nbdb and sbdb databases from all of the nodes in the cluster. Adding the - gather_network_logs option to include additional logs that contain OVN-Kubernetes transactions for OVN nbdb database.
----
2. Create a compressed file from the must-gather directory that was just created in your working directory. Make sure you provide the date and cluster ID for the unique must-gather data. For more information about how to find the cluster ID, see How to find the cluster-id or name on OpenShift cluster. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

```terminal
$ tar cvaf must-gather-`date +"%m-%d-%Y-%H-%M-%S"`-<cluster_id>.tar.gz <must_gather_local_dir>1
```

Replace <must_gather_local_dir> with the actual directory name.
3. Attach the compressed file to your support case on the the Customer Support page of the Red Hat Customer Portal.

## Changing the must-gather storage limit

When using the oc adm must-gather command to collect data the default maximum storage for the information is 30% of the storage capacity of the container. After the 30% limit is reached the container is killed and the gathering process stops. Information already gathered is downloaded to your local storage. To run the must-gather command again, you need either a container with more storage capacity or to adjust the maximum volume percentage.

If the container reaches the storage limit, an error message similar to the following example is generated.


```terminal
Disk usage exceeds the volume percentage of 30% for mounted directory. Exiting...
```


* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* The OpenShift CLI (oc) is installed.

* Run the oc adm must-gather command with the volume-percentage flag. The new value cannot exceed 100.

```terminal
$ oc adm must-gather --volume-percentage <storage_percentage>
```


# About Support Log Gather

Support Log Gather Operator builds on the functionality of the traditional must-gather tool to automate the collection of debugging data. It streamlines troubleshooting by packaging the collected information into a single .tar file and automatically uploading it to the specified Red&#160;Hat Support case.


[IMPORTANT]
----
{FeatureName} is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.

## Configuring a Support Log Gather instance

You must create a MustGather custom resource (CR) from the command-line interface (CLI) to automate the collection of diagnostic data from your cluster. This process also automatically uploads the data to a Red&#160;Hat Support case.


[IMPORTANT]
----
{FeatureName} is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
----

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) tool.
* You have installed Support Log Gather in your cluster.
* You have a Red Hat Support case ID.
* You have created a Kubernetes secret containing your Red Hat Customer Portal credentials. The secret must contain a username field and a password field.
* You have created a service account.

1. Create a YAML file for the MustGather CR, such as support-log-gather.yaml, that contains the following basic configuration::
Example support-log-gather.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: MustGather
metadata:
  name: example-mg
  namespace: must-gather-operator
spec:
  serviceAccountName: must-gather-operator
  audit: true
  proxyConfig:
    httpProxy: "http://proxy.example.com:8080"
    httpsProxy: "https://proxy.example.com:8443"
    noProxy: ".example.com,localhost"
  mustGatherTimeout: "1h30m9s"
  uploadTarget:
    type: SFTP
    sftp:
      caseID: "04230315"
      caseManagementAccountSecretRef:
        name: mustgather-creds
      host: "sftp.access.redhat.com"
  retainResourcesOnCompletion: true
  storage:
    type: PersistentVolume
    persistentVolume:
      claim:
        name: mustgather-pvc
      subPath: must-gather-bundles/case-04230315
```


For more information on the configuration parameters, see "Configuration parameters for MustGather custom resource".
2. Create the MustGather object by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f support-log-gather.yaml
```


1. Verify that the MustGather CR was created by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get mustgather
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME          AGE
example-mg    7s
```

2. Verify the status of the pods in the Operator namespace by running the following command.

```terminal
$ oc get pods
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                                                              READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
must-gather-operator-657fc74d64-2gg2w                             1/1     Running     0          13m
example-mg-gk8m8                                                  2/2     Running     0          13s
```


A new pod with a name based on the MustGather CR must be created. The status of all the pods must be Running.
3. To monitor the progress of the file upload, view the logs of the upload container in the job pod by running the following command:

```terminal
oc logs -f pod/example-mg-gk8m8 -c upload
```


When successful, the process must create an archive and upload it to the Red&#160;Hat Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) server for the specified case.

## Configuration parameters for MustGather custom resource

You can manage your MustGather custom resource (CR) by creating a YAML file that specifies the parameters for data collection and the upload process.
The following table provides an overview of the parameters that you can configure in the MustGather CR.




[NOTE]
----
If you do not specify spec.uploadTarget or spec.storage, the pod saves the data to an ephemeral volume and the data is permanently deleted when the pod terminates.

# Obtaining your cluster ID

When providing information to Red Hat Support, it is helpful to provide the unique identifier for your cluster. You can have your cluster ID autofilled by using the {product-title} web console. You can also manually obtain your cluster ID by using the web console or the OpenShift CLI (oc).

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You have access to the web console or the OpenShift CLI (oc) installed.

* To manually obtain your cluster ID using the web console:
1. Navigate to Home -> Overview.
2. The value is available in the Cluster ID field of the Details section.
* To obtain your cluster ID using the OpenShift CLI (oc), run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get clusterversion -o jsonpath='{.items[].spec.clusterID}{"\n"}'
```


# About sosreport

sosreport is a tool that collects configuration details, system information, and diagnostic data from Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) systems. sosreport provides a standardized way to collect diagnostic information relating to a node, which can then be provided to Red Hat Support for issue diagnosis.

In some support interactions, Red Hat Support may ask you to collect a sosreport archive for a specific {product-title} node. For example, it might sometimes be necessary to review system logs or other node-specific data that is not included within the output of oc adm must-gather.

# Generating a sosreport archive for an {product-title} cluster node

The recommended way to generate a sosreport for an {product-title} {product-version} cluster node is through a debug pod.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You have SSH access to your hosts.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have a Red Hat standard or premium Subscription.
* You have a Red Hat Customer Portal account.
* You have an existing Red Hat Support case ID.

1. Obtain a list of cluster nodes:

```terminal
$ oc get nodes
```

2. Enter into a debug session on the target node. This step instantiates a debug pod called <node_name>-debug:

```terminal
$ oc debug node/my-cluster-node
```


To enter into a debug session on the target node that is tainted with the NoExecute effect, add a toleration to a dummy namespace, and start the debug pod in the dummy namespace:

```terminal
$ oc new-project dummy
```


```terminal
$ oc patch namespace dummy --type=merge -p '{"metadata": {"annotations": { "scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/defaultTolerations": "[{\"operator\": \"Exists\"}]"}}}'
```


```terminal
$ oc debug node/my-cluster-node
```

3. Set /host as the root directory within the debug shell. The debug pod mounts the host's root file system in /host within the pod. By changing the root directory to /host, you can run binaries contained in the host's executable paths:

```terminal
# chroot /host
```


[NOTE]
----
{product-title} {product-version} cluster nodes running Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) are immutable and rely on Operators to apply cluster changes. Accessing cluster nodes by using SSH is not recommended. However, if the {product-title} API is not available, or the kubelet is not properly functioning on the target node, oc operations will be impacted. In such situations, it is possible to access nodes using ssh core@<node>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain> instead.
----
4. Start a toolbox container, which includes the required binaries and plugins to run sosreport:

```terminal
# toolbox
```


[NOTE]
----
If an existing toolbox pod is already running, the toolbox command outputs 'toolbox-' already exists. Trying to start&#8230;&#8203;. Remove the running toolbox container with podman rm toolbox- and spawn a new toolbox container, to avoid issues with sosreport plugins.
----
5. Collect a sosreport archive.
1. Run the sos report command to collect necessary troubleshooting data on crio and podman:

```terminal
# sos report -k crio.all=on -k crio.logs=on  -k podman.all=on -k podman.logs=on 1
```

-k enables you to define sosreport plugin parameters outside of the defaults.
2. Optional: To include information on OVN-Kubernetes networking configurations from a node in your report, run the following command:

```terminal
# sos report --all-logs
```

3. Press Enter when prompted, to continue.
4. Provide the Red Hat Support case ID. sosreport adds the ID to the archive's file name.
5. The sosreport output provides the archive's location and checksum. The following sample output references support case ID 01234567:

```terminal
Your sosreport has been generated and saved in:
  /host/var/tmp/sosreport-my-cluster-node-01234567-2020-05-28-eyjknxt.tar.xz 1

The checksum is: 382ffc167510fd71b4f12a4f40b97a4e
```

The sosreport archive's file path is outside of the chroot environment because the toolbox container mounts the host's root directory at /host.
6. Provide the sosreport archive to Red Hat Support for analysis, using one of the following methods.
* Upload the file to an existing Red Hat support case.
1. Concatenate the sosreport archive by running the oc debug node/<node_name> command and redirect the output to a file. This command assumes you have exited the previous oc debug session:

```terminal
$ oc debug node/my-cluster-node -- bash -c 'cat /host/var/tmp/sosreport-my-cluster-node-01234567-2020-05-28-eyjknxt.tar.xz' > /tmp/sosreport-my-cluster-node-01234567-2020-05-28-eyjknxt.tar.xz 1
```

The debug container mounts the host's root directory at /host. Reference the absolute path from the debug container's root directory, including /host, when specifying target files for concatenation.

[NOTE]
----
{product-title} {product-version} cluster nodes running Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) are immutable and rely on Operators to apply cluster changes. Transferring a sosreport archive from a cluster node by using scp is not recommended. However, if the {product-title} API is not available, or the kubelet is not properly functioning on the target node, oc operations will be impacted. In such situations, it is possible to copy a sosreport archive from a node by running scp core@<node>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>:<file_path> <local_path>.
----
2. Navigate to an existing support case within the Customer Support page of the Red Hat Customer Portal.
3. Select Attach files and follow the prompts to upload the file.

# Querying bootstrap node journal logs

If you experience bootstrap-related issues, you can gather bootkube.service journald unit logs and container logs from the bootstrap node.

* You have SSH access to your bootstrap node.
* You have the fully qualified domain name of the bootstrap node.

1. Query bootkube.service journald unit logs from a bootstrap node during {product-title} installation. Replace <bootstrap_fqdn> with the bootstrap node's fully qualified domain name:

```terminal
$ ssh core@<bootstrap_fqdn> journalctl -b -f -u bootkube.service
```


[NOTE]
----
The bootkube.service log on the bootstrap node outputs etcd connection refused errors, indicating that the bootstrap server is unable to connect to etcd on control plane nodes. After etcd has started on each control plane node and the nodes have joined the cluster, the errors should stop.
----
2. Collect logs from the bootstrap node containers using podman on the bootstrap node. Replace <bootstrap_fqdn> with the bootstrap node's fully qualified domain name:

```terminal
$ ssh core@<bootstrap_fqdn> 'for pod in $(sudo podman ps -a -q); do sudo podman logs $pod; done'
```


# Querying cluster node journal logs

You can gather journald unit logs and other logs within /var/log on individual cluster nodes.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* Your API service is still functional.
* You have SSH access to your hosts.

1. Query kubelet journald unit logs from {product-title} cluster nodes. The following example queries control plane nodes only:

```terminal
$ oc adm node-logs --role=master -u kubelet  1
```

* kubelet: Replace as appropriate to query other unit logs.
2. Collect logs from specific subdirectories under /var/log/ on cluster nodes.
1. Retrieve a list of logs contained within a /var/log/ subdirectory. The following example lists files in /var/log/openshift-apiserver/ on all control plane nodes:

```terminal
$ oc adm node-logs --role=master --path=openshift-apiserver
```

2. Inspect a specific log within a /var/log/ subdirectory. The following example outputs /var/log/openshift-apiserver/audit.log contents from all control plane nodes:

```terminal
$ oc adm node-logs --role=master --path=openshift-apiserver/audit.log
```

3. If the API is not functional, review the logs on each node using SSH instead. The following example tails /var/log/openshift-apiserver/audit.log:

```terminal
$ ssh core@<master-node>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain> sudo tail -f /var/log/openshift-apiserver/audit.log
```


[NOTE]
----
{product-title} {product-version} cluster nodes running Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) are immutable and rely on Operators to apply cluster changes. Accessing cluster nodes by using SSH is not recommended. Before attempting to collect diagnostic data over SSH, review whether the data collected by running oc adm must gather and other oc commands is sufficient instead. However, if the {product-title} API is not available, or the kubelet is not properly functioning on the target node, oc operations will be impacted. In such situations, it is possible to access nodes using ssh core@<node>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.

# Network trace methods

Collecting network traces, in the form of packet capture records, can assist Red Hat Support with troubleshooting network issues.

{product-title} supports two ways of performing a network trace.
Review the following table and choose the method that meets your needs.



# Collecting a host network trace

Sometimes, troubleshooting a network-related issue is simplified by tracing network communication and capturing packets on multiple nodes at the same time.

You can use a combination of the oc adm must-gather command and the registry.redhat.io/openshift4/network-tools-rhel8 container image to gather packet captures from nodes.
Analyzing packet captures can help you troubleshoot network communication issues.

The oc adm must-gather command is used to run the tcpdump command in pods on specific nodes.
The tcpdump command records the packet captures in the pods.
When the tcpdump command exits, the oc adm must-gather command transfers the files with the packet captures from the pods to your client machine.


[TIP]
----
The sample command in the following procedure demonstrates performing a packet capture with the tcpdump command.
However, you can run any command in the container image that is specified in the --image argument to gather troubleshooting information from multiple nodes at the same time.
----

* You are logged in to {product-title} as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Run a packet capture from the host network on some nodes by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc adm must-gather \
    --dest-dir /tmp/captures \1
    --source-dir '/tmp/tcpdump/' \2
    --image registry.redhat.io/openshift4/network-tools-rhel8:latest \3
    --node-selector 'node-role.kubernetes.io/worker' \4
    --host-network=true \5
    --timeout 30s \6
    -- \
    tcpdump -i any \7
    -w /tmp/tcpdump/%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.pcap -W 1 -G 300
```

The --dest-dir argument specifies that oc adm must-gather stores the packet captures in directories that are relative to /tmp/captures on the client machine. You can specify any writable directory.
When tcpdump is run in the debug pod that oc adm must-gather starts, the --source-dir argument specifies that the packet captures are temporarily stored in the /tmp/tcpdump directory on the pod.
The --image argument specifies a container image that includes the tcpdump command.
The --node-selector argument and example value specifies to perform the packet captures on the worker nodes. As an alternative, you can specify the --node-name argument instead to run the packet capture on a single node. If you omit both the --node-selector and the --node-name argument, the packet captures are performed on all nodes.
The --host-network=true argument is required so that the packet captures are performed on the network interfaces of the node.
The --timeout argument and value specify to run the debug pod for 30 seconds. If you do not specify the --timeout argument and a duration, the debug pod runs for 10 minutes.
The -i any argument for the tcpdump command specifies to capture packets on all network interfaces. As an alternative, you can specify a network interface name.
2. Perform the action, such as accessing a web application, that triggers the network communication issue while the network trace captures packets.
3. Review the packet capture files that oc adm must-gather transferred from the pods to your client machine:

```text
tmp/captures
├── event-filter.html
├── ip-10-0-192-217-ec2-internal  1
│   └── registry-redhat-io-openshift4-network-tools-rhel8-sha256-bca...
│       └── 2022-01-13T19:31:31.pcap
├── ip-10-0-201-178-ec2-internal  1
│   └── registry-redhat-io-openshift4-network-tools-rhel8-sha256-bca...
│       └── 2022-01-13T19:31:30.pcap
├── ip-...
└── timestamp
```

The packet captures are stored in directories that identify the hostname, container, and file name.
If you did not specify the --node-selector argument, then the directory level for the hostname is not present.

# Collecting a network trace from an {product-title} node or container

When investigating potential network-related {product-title} issues, Red Hat Support might request a network packet trace from a specific {product-title} cluster node or from a specific container. The recommended method to capture a network trace in {product-title} is through a debug pod.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have an existing Red Hat Support case ID.
* You have a Red Hat standard or premium Subscription.
* You have a Red Hat Customer Portal account.
* You have SSH access to your hosts.

1. Obtain a list of cluster nodes:

```terminal
$ oc get nodes
```

2. Enter into a debug session on the target node. This step instantiates a debug pod called <node_name>-debug:

```terminal
$ oc debug node/my-cluster-node
```

3. Set /host as the root directory within the debug shell. The debug pod mounts the host's root file system in /host within the pod. By changing the root directory to /host, you can run binaries contained in the host's executable paths:

```terminal
# chroot /host
```


[NOTE]
----
{product-title} {product-version} cluster nodes running Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) are immutable and rely on Operators to apply cluster changes. Accessing cluster nodes by using SSH is not recommended. However, if the {product-title} API is not available, or the kubelet is not properly functioning on the target node, oc operations will be impacted. In such situations, it is possible to access nodes using ssh core@<node>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain> instead.
----
4. From within the chroot environment console, obtain the node's interface names:

```terminal
# ip ad
```

5. Start a toolbox container, which includes the required binaries and plugins to run sosreport:

```terminal
# toolbox
```


[NOTE]
----
If an existing toolbox pod is already running, the toolbox command outputs 'toolbox-' already exists. Trying to start&#8230;&#8203;. To avoid tcpdump issues, remove the running toolbox container with podman rm toolbox- and spawn a new toolbox container.
----
6. Initiate a tcpdump session on the cluster node and redirect output to a capture file. This example uses ens5 as the interface name:

```terminal
$ tcpdump -nn -s 0 -i ens5 -w /host/var/tmp/my-cluster-node_$(date +%d_%m_%Y-%H_%M_%S-%Z).pcap  1
```

The tcpdump capture file's path is outside of the chroot environment because the toolbox container mounts the host's root directory at /host.
7. If a tcpdump capture is required for a specific container on the node, follow these steps.
1. Determine the target container ID. The chroot host command precedes the crictl command in this step because the toolbox container mounts the host's root directory at /host:

```terminal
# chroot /host crictl ps
```

2. Determine the container's process ID. In this example, the container ID is a7fe32346b120:

```terminal
# chroot /host crictl inspect --output yaml a7fe32346b120 | grep 'pid' | awk '{print $2}'
```

3. Initiate a tcpdump session on the container and redirect output to a capture file. This example uses 49628 as the container's process ID and ens5 as the interface name. The nsenter command enters the namespace of a target process and runs a command in its namespace. because the target process in this example is a container's process ID, the tcpdump command is run in the container's namespace from the host:

```terminal
# nsenter -n -t 49628 -- tcpdump -nn -i ens5 -w /host/var/tmp/my-cluster-node-my-container_$(date +%d_%m_%Y-%H_%M_%S-%Z).pcap  1
```

The tcpdump capture file's path is outside of the chroot environment because the toolbox container mounts the host's root directory at /host.
8. Provide the tcpdump capture file to Red Hat Support for analysis, using one of the following methods.
* Upload the file to an existing Red Hat support case.
1. Concatenate the sosreport archive by running the oc debug node/<node_name> command and redirect the output to a file. This command assumes you have exited the previous oc debug session:

```terminal
$ oc debug node/my-cluster-node -- bash -c 'cat /host/var/tmp/my-tcpdump-capture-file.pcap' > /tmp/my-tcpdump-capture-file.pcap 1
```

The debug container mounts the host's root directory at /host. Reference the absolute path from the debug container's root directory, including /host, when specifying target files for concatenation.

[NOTE]
----
{product-title} {product-version} cluster nodes running Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) are immutable and rely on Operators to apply cluster changes. Transferring a tcpdump capture file from a cluster node by using scp is not recommended. However, if the {product-title} API is not available, or the kubelet is not properly functioning on the target node, oc operations will be impacted. In such situations, it is possible to copy a tcpdump capture file from a node by running scp core@<node>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>:<file_path> <local_path>.
----
2. Navigate to an existing support case within the Customer Support page of the Red Hat Customer Portal.
3. Select Attach files and follow the prompts to upload the file.

# Providing diagnostic data to Red Hat Support

When investigating {product-title} issues, Red Hat Support might ask you to upload diagnostic data to a support case. Files can be uploaded to a support case through the Red Hat Customer Portal.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have SSH access to your hosts.
* You have a Red Hat standard or premium Subscription.
* You have a Red Hat Customer Portal account.
* You have an existing Red Hat Support case ID.

* Upload diagnostic data to an existing Red Hat support case through the Red Hat Customer Portal.
1. Concatenate a diagnostic file contained on an {product-title} node by using the oc debug node/<node_name> command and redirect the output to a file. The following example copies /host/var/tmp/my-diagnostic-data.tar.gz from a debug container to /var/tmp/my-diagnostic-data.tar.gz:

```terminal
$ oc debug node/my-cluster-node -- bash -c 'cat /host/var/tmp/my-diagnostic-data.tar.gz' > /var/tmp/my-diagnostic-data.tar.gz 1
```

The debug container mounts the host's root directory at /host. Reference the absolute path from the debug container's root directory, including /host, when specifying target files for concatenation.

# About toolbox

toolbox is a tool that starts a container on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) system. The tool is primarily used to start a container that includes the required binaries and plugins that are needed to run commands such as sosreport.

The primary purpose for a toolbox container is to gather diagnostic information and to provide it to Red Hat Support. However, if additional diagnostic tools are required, you can add RPM packages or run an image that is an alternative to the standard support tools image.

## Installing packages to a toolbox container

By default, running the toolbox command starts a container with the registry.redhat.io/rhel9/support-tools:latest image. This image contains the most frequently used support tools. If you need to collect node-specific data that requires a support tool that is not part of the image, you can install additional packages.

* You have accessed a node with the oc debug node/<node_name> command.
* You can access your system as a user with root privileges.

1. Set /host as the root directory within the debug shell. The debug pod mounts the host's root file system in /host within the pod. By changing the root directory to /host, you can run binaries contained in the host's executable paths:

```terminal
# chroot /host
```

2. Start the toolbox container:

```terminal
# toolbox
```

3. Install the additional package, such as wget:

```terminal
# dnf install -y <package_name>
```


## Starting an alternative image with toolbox

By default, running the toolbox command starts a container with the registry.redhat.io/rhel9/support-tools:latest image.


[NOTE]
----
You can start an alternative image by creating a .toolboxrc file and specifying the image to run. However, running an older version of the support-tools image, such as registry.redhat.io/rhel8/support-tools:latest,  is not supported on {product-title} {product-version}.
----

* You have accessed a node with the oc debug node/<node_name> command.
* You can access your system as a user with root privileges.

1. Set /host as the root directory within the debug shell. The debug pod mounts the host's root file system in /host within the pod. By changing the root directory to /host, you can run binaries contained in the host's executable paths:

```terminal
# chroot /host
```

2. Optional: If you need to use an alternative image instead of the default image, create a .toolboxrc file in the home directory for the root user ID, and specify the image metadata:

```text
REGISTRY=quay.io             1
IMAGE=fedora/fedora:latest   2
TOOLBOX_NAME=toolbox-fedora-latest  3
```

Optional: Specify an alternative container registry.
Specify an alternative image to start.
Optional: Specify an alternative name for the toolbox container.
3. Start a toolbox container by entering the following command:

```terminal
# toolbox
```


[NOTE]
----
If an existing toolbox pod is already running, the toolbox command outputs 'toolbox-' already exists. Trying to start&#8230;&#8203;. To avoid issues with sosreport plugins, remove the running toolbox container with podman rm toolbox- and then spawn a new toolbox container.
----
