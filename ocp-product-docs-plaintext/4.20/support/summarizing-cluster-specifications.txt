# Summarizing cluster specifications



# Summarizing cluster specifications by using a cluster version object

You can obtain a summary of {product-title} cluster specifications by querying the clusterversion resource.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Query cluster version, availability, uptime, and general status:

```terminal
$ oc get clusterversion
```

Example output

```text
NAME      VERSION   AVAILABLE   PROGRESSING   SINCE   STATUS
version   4.13.8    True        False         8h      Cluster version is 4.13.8
```

2. Obtain a detailed summary of cluster specifications, update availability, and update history:

```terminal
$ oc describe clusterversion
```

Example output

```text
Name:         version
Namespace:
Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  <none>
API Version:  config.openshift.io/v1
Kind:         ClusterVersion
