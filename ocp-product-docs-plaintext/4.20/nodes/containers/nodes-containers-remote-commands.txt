# Executing remote commands in an {product-title} container


You can use the CLI to execute remote commands in {product-title} containers.

# Executing remote commands in containers

Support for remote container command execution is built into the CLI.

To run a command in a container:


```terminal
$ oc exec <pod> [-c <container>] -- <command> [<arg_1> ... <arg_n>]
```


For example:


```terminal
$ oc exec mypod date
```



```terminal
Thu Apr  9 02:21:53 UTC 2015
```



[IMPORTANT]
----
For security purposes, the
oc exec command does not work when accessing privileged containers except when
the command is executed by a cluster-admin user.

# Protocol for initiating a remote command from a client

Clients initiate the execution of a remote command in a container by issuing a
request to the Kubernetes API server:


```terminal
/proxy/nodes/<node_name>/exec/<namespace>/<pod>/<container>?command=<command>
```


In the above URL:

* <node_name> is the FQDN of the node.
* <namespace> is the project of the target pod.
* <pod> is the name of the target pod.
* <container> is the name of the target container.
* <command> is the desired command to be executed.

For example:


```terminal
/proxy/nodes/node123.openshift.com/exec/myns/mypod/mycontainer?command=date
```


Additionally, the client can add parameters to the request to indicate if:

* the client should send input to the remote container's command (stdin).
* the client's terminal is a TTY.
* the remote container's command should send output from stdout to the client.
* the remote container's command should send output from stderr to the client.

After sending an exec request to the API server, the client upgrades the
connection to one that supports multiplexed streams; the current implementation
uses HTTP/2.

The client creates one stream each for stdin, stdout, and stderr. To distinguish
among the streams, the client sets the streamType header on the stream to one
of stdin, stdout, or stderr.

The client closes all streams, the upgraded connection, and the underlying
connection when it is finished with the remote command execution request.
