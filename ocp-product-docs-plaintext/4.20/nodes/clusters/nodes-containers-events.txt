# Viewing system event information in {product-title} clusters


Events in {product-title} are modeled based on events that happen to API objects
in an {product-title} cluster.

# Understanding events

Events allow {product-title} to record
information about real-world events in a resource-agnostic manner. They also
allow developers and administrators to consume information about system
components in a unified way.

# Viewing events using the CLI

You can get a list of events in a given project using the CLI.

* To view events in a project use the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get events [-n <project>] 1
```

The name of the project.

For example:

```terminal
$ oc get events -n openshift-config
```

Example output

```terminal

* To view events in your project from the {product-title} console.
1. Launch the {product-title} console.
2. Click Home -> Events and select your project.
3. Move to resource that you want to see events. For example: Home -> Projects -> <project-name> -> <resource-name>.

Many objects, such as pods and deployments, have their own
Events tab as well, which shows events related to that object.
