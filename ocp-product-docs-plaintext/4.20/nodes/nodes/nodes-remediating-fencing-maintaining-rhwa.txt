# Remediating, fencing, and maintaining nodes



When node-level failures occur, such as the kernel hangs or network interface controllers (NICs) fail, the work required from the cluster does not decrease, and workloads from affected nodes need to be restarted somewhere. Failures affecting these workloads risk data loss, corruption, or both. It is important to isolate the node, known as fencing, before initiating recovery of the workload, known as remediation, and recovery of the node.

For more information on remediation, fencing, and maintaining nodes, see the Workload Availability for Red Hat OpenShift documentation.
