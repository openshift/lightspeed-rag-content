# Cluster Observability Operator release notes


The Cluster Observability Operator (COO) is an optional Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Operator that enables administrators to create standalone monitoring stacks that are independently configurable for use by different services and users.
The COO complements the built-in monitoring capabilities of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. You can deploy it in parallel with the default platform and user workload monitoring stacks managed by the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO).
These release notes track the development of the Cluster Observability Operator in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
The following table provides information about which features are available depending on the version of Cluster Observability Operator and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform:

# Cluster Observability Operator 1.1.1

## Bug fixes

* Previously, observability-operator and perses-operator pods on many clusters entered a CrashLoopBackOff state due to OutOfMemory errors, after upgrading from Cluster Observability Operator 1.0. This release resolves the issue. (COO-784)

# Cluster Observability Operator 1.1

## New features and enhancements

* You can now install the monitoring UI plugin using COO. (COO-262)
* You can enable incident detection in the monitoring UI plugin. (COO-690)
* TLS support for the Thanos web endpoint has been added. (COO-222)

# Known issues

These are the known issues in Cluster Observability Operator 1.1.0:

* observability-operator and perses-operator pods enter a CrashLoopBackOff state due to OutOfMemory errors, after upgrading from Cluster Observability Operator 1.0.

A workaround is provided in the knowledge base article ClusterObservability and perses operator pod in CrashLoopBackOff due to OOMKilled in RHOCP4.

This issue is being tracked in COO-784.

## Bug fixes

* Previously, the logging UI plugin did not support setting a custom LokiStack name or namespace. This release resolves the issue. (COO-332)

# Cluster Observability Operator 1.0

## New features and enhancements

* COO is now enabled for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform platform monitoring. (COO-476)
* Implements HTTPS support for COO web server. (COO-480)
* Implements authn/authz for COO web server. (COO-481)
* Configures ServiceMonitor resource to collect metrics from COO. (COO-482)
* Adds operatorframework.io/cluster-monitoring=true annotation to the OLM bundle. (COO-483)
* Defines the alerting strategy for COO . (COO-484)
* Configures PrometheusRule for alerting. (COO-485)
* Support level annotations have been added to the UIPlugin CR when created. The support level is based on the plugin type, with values of DevPreview, TechPreview, or GeneralAvailability. (COO-318)

* You can now configure the Alertmanager scheme and tlsConfig fields in the Prometheus CR. (COO-219)

* The extended Technical Preview for the troubleshooting panel adds support for correlating traces with Kubernetes resources and directly with other observable signals including logs, alerts, metrics, and network events. (COO-450)
* You can select a Tempo instance and tenant when you navigate to the tracing page by clicking Observe -> Tracing in the web console. The preview troubleshooting panel only works with the openshift-tracing / platform instance and the platform tenant.
* The troubleshooting panel works best in the Administrator perspective. It has limited functionality in the Developer perspective due to authorization issues with some back ends, most notably Prometheus for metrics and alerts. This will be addressed in a future release.

The following table provides information about which features are available depending on the version of Cluster Observability Operator and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform:



## CVEs

* CVE-2023-26159
* CVE-2024-28849
* CVE-2024-45338

## Bug fixes

* Previously, the default namespace for the COO  installation was openshift-operators. With this release, the defaullt namespace changes to openshift-cluster-observability-operator. (COO-32)

* Previously, when viewing a Tempo instance from the Distributed Tracing UI plugin, the scatter plot graph showing the traces duration was not rendered correctly. The bubble size was too large and overlapped the x and y axis. With this release, the graph is rendered correctly. (COO-319)

# Cluster Observability Operator 0.1.2

The following advisory is available for Cluster Observability Operator 0.1.2:

* RHEA-2024:1534 Cluster Observability Operator 0.1.2

## CVEs

* CVE-2023-45142

Because of these missing annotations, certain COO features and capabilities did not appear in the package manifest or in the OperatorHub user interface.
This release adds the missing annotations, thereby resolving this issue. (COO-11)
* Previously, automatic updates of the COO did not work, and a newer version of the Operator did not automatically replace the older version, even though the newer version was available in OperatorHub.
