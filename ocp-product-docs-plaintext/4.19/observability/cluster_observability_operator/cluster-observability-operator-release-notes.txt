# Cluster Observability Operator release notes


The Cluster Observability Operator (COO) is an optional Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Operator that enables administrators to create standalone monitoring stacks that are independently configurable for use by different services and users.
The COO complements the built-in monitoring capabilities of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. You can deploy it in parallel with the default platform and user workload monitoring stacks managed by the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO).
These release notes track the development of the Cluster Observability Operator in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
The following table provides information about which features are available depending on the version of Cluster Observability Operator and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform:

# Cluster Observability Operator 1.2.1

## Bug fixes

* Before this update, an old version label matcher was retained during the Operator version 1.2 upgrade. This caused Perses dashboards to become unavailable. With this release, the version label is removed and Perses dashboards are correctly reconciled.

## Known issues

These are the known issues in Cluster Observability Operator 1.2.1:

* Upgrading from version 1.2.0 to 1.2.1 corrupts the monitoring plugin's UIPlugin resource, when you have also deployed distributed tracing, the troubleshooting panel, and Advance Cluster Management (ACM), together with the monitoring UI plugin. You can resolve this issue by recreating the UI plugin. (COO-1051)

# Cluster Observability Operator 1.2

The following advisory is available for Cluster Observability Operator 1.2:

* RHBA-2025:8940 Cluster Observability Operator 1.2

## New features and enhancements

* The logging UI plugin now supports the OTEL format, in addition to the previously supported ViaQ scheme. (COO-816)
* Accelerators Perses dashboards are deployed by default when you install the monitoring UI plugin. (COO-942)
* Multiple results per graph node are now displayed for Korrel8r. (COO-785)
* Direct navigation to individual incident detail is now supported in the incident detection panel, and this enables the incidents overview functionality in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) 2.14. (COO-977, ACM-18751)
* Advanced filters have been added to the tracing view. (COO-979)
* The status of the distributed tracing UI plugin is now General Availability (GA), supporting Patternfly 4, 5 and 6. (COO-873)

## Bug fixes

* Previously, LokiStack was a prerequisite for installing the logging UI plugin. With this release, you can install the logging UI plugin without LokiStack. (COO-760)
* Previously, the Silence Alert button in the Incidents -> Component section did not pre-populate the fields and was not usable. This release resolves the issue. (COO-970)

## Known issues

These are the known issues in Cluster Observability Operator 1.2.0:

* When upgrading from COO 1.1.1 to COO 1.2, the Perses dashboard is not correctly reconciled, and this requires the monitoring UI plugin to be reinstalled. (COO-978)

# Cluster Observability Operator 1.1.1

## Bug fixes

* Previously, observability-operator and perses-operator pods on many clusters entered a CrashLoopBackOff state due to OutOfMemory errors, after upgrading from Cluster Observability Operator 1.0. This release resolves the issue. (COO-784)

# Cluster Observability Operator 1.1

The following advisory is available for Cluster Observability Operator 1.1:

* RHBA-2025:4360 Cluster Observability Operator 1.1

## New features and enhancements

* You can now install the monitoring UI plugin using COO. (COO-262)
* You can enable incident detection in the monitoring UI plugin. (COO-690)
* TLS support for the Thanos web endpoint has been added. (COO-222)

## Known issues

These are the known issues in Cluster Observability Operator 1.1.0:

* observability-operator and perses-operator pods enter a CrashLoopBackOff state due to OutOfMemory errors, after upgrading from Cluster Observability Operator 1.0.

A workaround is provided in the knowledge base article ClusterObservability and perses operator pod in CrashLoopBackOff due to OOMKilled in RHOCP4.

This issue is being tracked in COO-784.

## Bug fixes

* Previously, the logging UI plugin did not support setting a custom LokiStack name or namespace. This release resolves the issue. (COO-332)

# Cluster Observability Operator 1.0

## New features and enhancements

* COO is now enabled for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform platform monitoring. (COO-476)
* Implements HTTPS support for COO web server. (COO-480)
* Implements authn/authz for COO web server. (COO-481)
* Configures ServiceMonitor resource to collect metrics from COO. (COO-482)
* Adds operatorframework.io/cluster-monitoring=true annotation to the OLM bundle. (COO-483)
* Defines the alerting strategy for COO . (COO-484)
* Configures PrometheusRule for alerting. (COO-485)
* Support level annotations have been added to the UIPlugin CR when created. The support level is based on the plugin type, with values of DevPreview, TechPreview, or GeneralAvailability. (COO-318)

* You can now configure the Alertmanager scheme and tlsConfig fields in the Prometheus CR. (COO-219)

* The extended Technical Preview for the troubleshooting panel adds support for correlating traces with Kubernetes resources and directly with other observable signals including logs, alerts, metrics, and network events. (COO-450)
* You can select a Tempo instance and tenant when you navigate to the tracing page by clicking Observe -> Tracing in the web console. The preview troubleshooting panel only works with the openshift-tracing / platform instance and the platform tenant.
* The troubleshooting panel works best in the Administrator perspective. It has limited functionality in the Developer perspective due to authorization issues with some back ends, most notably Prometheus for metrics and alerts. This will be addressed in a future release.

The following table provides information about which features are available depending on the version of Cluster Observability Operator and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform:



## CVEs

* CVE-2023-26159
* CVE-2024-28849
* CVE-2024-45338

## Bug fixes

* Previously, the default namespace for the COO  installation was openshift-operators. With this release, the defaullt namespace changes to openshift-cluster-observability-operator. (COO-32)
* Previously, korrel8r was only able to parse time series selector expressions. With this release, korrel8r can parse any valid PromQL expression to extract the time series selectors that it uses for correlation. (COO-558)
* Previously, when viewing a Tempo instance from the Distributed Tracing UI plugin, the scatter plot graph showing the traces duration was not rendered correctly. The bubble size was too large and overlapped the x and y axis. With this release, the graph is rendered correctly. (COO-319)
