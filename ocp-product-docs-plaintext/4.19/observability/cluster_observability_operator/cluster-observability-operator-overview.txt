# Cluster Observability Operator overview


The Cluster Observability Operator (COO) is an optional component of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform designed for creating and managing highly customizable monitoring stacks. It enables cluster administrators to automate configuration and management of monitoring needs extensively, offering a more tailored and detailed view of each namespace compared to the default Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring system.
The COO deploys the following monitoring components:
* Prometheus - A highly available Prometheus instance capable of sending metrics to an external endpoint by using remote write.
* Thanos Querier (optional) - Enables querying of Prometheus instances from a central location.
* Alertmanager (optional) - Provides alert configuration capabilities for different services.
* UI plugins (optional) - Enhances the observability capabilities with plugins for monitoring, logging, distributed tracing and troubleshooting.
* Korrel8r (optional) - Provides observability signal correlation, powered by the open source Korrel8r project.

# COO compared to default monitoring stack

The COO components function independently of the default in-cluster monitoring stack, which is deployed and managed by the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO).
Monitoring stacks deployed by the two Operators do not conflict. You can use a COO monitoring stack in addition to the default platform monitoring components deployed by the CMO.

The key differences between COO and the default in-cluster monitoring stack are shown in the following table:



# Key advantages of using COO

Deploying COO helps you address monitoring requirements that are hard to achieve using the default monitoring stack.

## Extensibility

* You can add more metrics to a COO-deployed monitoring stack, which is not possible with core platform monitoring without losing support.
* You can receive cluster-specific metrics from core platform monitoring through federation.
* COO supports advanced monitoring scenarios like trend forecasting and anomaly detection.

## Multi-tenancy support

* You can create monitoring stacks per user namespace.
* You can deploy multiple stacks per namespace or a single stack for multiple namespaces.
* COO enables independent configuration of alerts and receivers for different teams.

## Scalability

* Supports multiple monitoring stacks on a single cluster.
* Enables monitoring of large clusters through manual sharding.
* Addresses cases where metrics exceed the capabilities of a single Prometheus instance.

## Flexibility

* Decoupled from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release cycles.
* Faster release iterations and rapid response to changing requirements.
* Independent management of alerting rules.

# Target users for COO

COO is ideal for users who need high customizability, scalability, and long-term data retention, especially in complex, multi-tenant enterprise environments.

## Enterprise-level users and administrators

Enterprise users require in-depth monitoring capabilities for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters, including advanced performance analysis, long-term data retention, trend forecasting, and historical analysis. These features help enterprises better understand resource usage, prevent performance issues, and optimize resource allocation.

## Operations teams in multi-tenant environments

With multi-tenancy support, COO allows different teams to configure monitoring views for their projects and applications, making it suitable for teams with flexible monitoring needs.

## Development and operations teams

COO provides fine-grained monitoring and customizable observability views for in-depth troubleshooting, anomaly detection, and performance tuning during development and operations.

# Using Server-Side Apply to customize Prometheus resources

Server-Side Apply is a feature that enables collaborative management of Kubernetes resources. The control plane tracks how different users and controllers manage fields within a Kubernetes object. It introduces the concept of field managers and tracks ownership of fields. This centralized control provides conflict detection and resolution, and reduces the risk of unintended overwrites.

Compared to Client-Side Apply, it is more declarative, and tracks field management instead of last applied state.

Server-Side Apply:: Declarative configuration management by updating a resource's state without needing to delete and recreate it.
Field management:: Users can specify which fields of a resource they want to update, without affecting the other fields.
Managed fields:: Kubernetes stores metadata about who manages each field of an object in the managedFields field within metadata.
Conflicts:: If multiple managers try to modify the same field, a conflict occurs. The applier can choose to overwrite, relinquish control, or share management.
Merge strategy:: Server-Side Apply merges fields based on the actor who manages them.

1. Add a MonitoringStack resource using the following configuration:
Example MonitoringStack object

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.rhobs/v1alpha1
kind: MonitoringStack
metadata:
  labels:
    coo: example
  name: sample-monitoring-stack
  namespace: coo-demo
spec:
  logLevel: debug
  retention: 1d
  resourceSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: demo
```

2. A Prometheus resource named sample-monitoring-stack is generated in the coo-demo namespace. Retrieve the managed fields of the generated Prometheus resource by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n coo-demo get Prometheus.monitoring.rhobs -oyaml --show-managed-fields
```

Example output

```yaml
managedFields:
- apiVersion: monitoring.rhobs/v1
  fieldsType: FieldsV1
  fieldsV1:
    f:metadata:
      f:labels:
        f:app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: {}

  manager: PrometheusOperator
  operation: Update
  subresource: status
```

3. Check the metadata.managedFields values, and observe that some fields in metadata and spec are managed by the MonitoringStack resource.
4. Modify a field that is not controlled by the MonitoringStack resource:
1. Change spec.enforcedSampleLimit, which is a field not set by the MonitoringStack resource. Create the file prom-spec-edited.yaml:
prom-spec-edited.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.rhobs/v1
kind: Prometheus
metadata:
  name: sample-monitoring-stack
  namespace: coo-demo
spec:
  enforcedSampleLimit: 1000
```

2. Apply the YAML by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f ./prom-spec-edited.yaml --server-side
```


[NOTE]
----
You must use the --server-side flag.
----
3. Get the changed Prometheus object and note that there is one more section in managedFields which has spec.enforcedSampleLimit:

```terminal
$ oc get prometheus -n coo-demo
```

Example output

```yaml
managedFields: 1
- apiVersion: monitoring.rhobs/v1
  fieldsType: FieldsV1
  fieldsV1:
    f:metadata:
      f:labels:
        f:app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: {}
        f:app.kubernetes.io/name: {}
        f:app.kubernetes.io/part-of: {}
    f:spec:
      f:enforcedSampleLimit: {} 2
  manager: kubectl
  operation: Apply
```

managedFields
spec.enforcedSampleLimit
5. Modify a field that is managed by the MonitoringStack resource:
1. Change spec.LogLevel, which is a field managed by the MonitoringStack resource, using the following YAML configuration:

```yaml
# changing the logLevel from debug to info
apiVersion: monitoring.rhobs/v1
kind: Prometheus
metadata:
  name: sample-monitoring-stack
  namespace: coo-demo
spec:
  logLevel: info 1
```

spec.logLevel has been added
2. Apply the YAML by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f ./prom-spec-edited.yaml --server-side
```

Example output

```terminal
error: Apply failed with 1 conflict: conflict with "observability-operator": .spec.logLevel
Please review the fields above--they currently have other managers. Here
are the ways you can resolve this warning:
* If you intend to manage all of these fields, please re-run the apply
  command with the `--force-conflicts` flag.
* If you do not intend to manage all of the fields, please edit your
  manifest to remove references to the fields that should keep their
  current managers.
* You may co-own fields by updating your manifest to match the existing
  value; in this case, you'll become the manager if the other manager(s)
  stop managing the field (remove it from their configuration).
See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/#conflicts
```

3. Notice that the field spec.logLevel cannot be changed using Server-Side Apply, because it is already managed by observability-operator.
4. Use the --force-conflicts flag to force the change.

```terminal
$ oc apply -f ./prom-spec-edited.yaml --server-side --force-conflicts
```

Example output

```terminal
prometheus.monitoring.rhobs/sample-monitoring-stack serverside-applied
```


With --force-conflicts flag, the field can be forced to change, but since the same field is also managed by the MonitoringStack resource, the Observability Operator detects the change, and reverts it back to the value set by the MonitoringStack resource.

[NOTE]
----
Some Prometheus fields generated by the MonitoringStack resource are influenced by the fields in the MonitoringStack spec stanza, for example, logLevel. These can be changed by changing the MonitoringStack spec.
----
5. To change the logLevel in the Prometheus object, apply the following YAML to change the MonitoringStack resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.rhobs/v1alpha1
kind: MonitoringStack
metadata:
  name: sample-monitoring-stack
  labels:
    coo: example
spec:
  logLevel: info
```

6. To confirm that the change has taken place, query for the log level by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n coo-demo get Prometheus.monitoring.rhobs -o=jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.logLevel}'
```

Example output

```terminal
info
```



[NOTE]
----
1. If a new version of an Operator generates a field that was previously generated and controlled by an actor, the value set by the actor will be overridden.

For example, you are managing a field enforcedSampleLimit which is not generated by the MonitoringStack resource. If the Observability Operator is upgraded, and the new version of the Operator generates a value for enforcedSampleLimit, this will overide the value you have previously set.
2. The Prometheus object generated by the MonitoringStack resource may contain some fields which are not explicitly set by the monitoring stack. These fields appear because they have default values.
