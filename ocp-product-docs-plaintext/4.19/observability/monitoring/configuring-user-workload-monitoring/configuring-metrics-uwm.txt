# Configuring metrics for user workload monitoring


Configure the collection of metrics to monitor how cluster components and your own workloads are performing.
You can send ingested metrics to remote systems for long-term storage and add cluster ID labels to the metrics to identify the data coming from different clusters.
* Understanding metrics

# Configuring remote write storage

You can configure remote write storage to enable Prometheus to send ingested metrics to remote systems for long-term storage. Doing so has no impact on how or for how long Prometheus stores metrics.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role or as a user with the user-workload-monitoring-config-edit role in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project.
* A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have set up a remote write compatible endpoint (such as Thanos) and know the endpoint URL. See the Prometheus remote endpoints and storage documentation for information about endpoints that are compatible with the remote write feature.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Red Hat only provides information for configuring remote write senders and does not offer guidance on configuring receiver endpoints. Customers are responsible for setting up their own endpoints that are remote-write compatible. Issues with endpoint receiver configurations are not included in Red Hat production support.
----
* You have set up authentication credentials in a Secret object for the remote write endpoint. You must create the secret in the {namespace-name} namespace.

[WARNING]
----
To reduce security risks, use HTTPS and authentication to send metrics to an endpoint.
----

1. Edit the {configmap-name} config map in the {namespace-name} project:

```terminal
$ oc -n {namespace-name} edit configmap {configmap-name}
```

2. Add a remoteWrite: section under data/config.yaml/{component}, as shown in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {configmap-name}
  namespace: {namespace-name}
data:
  config.yaml: |
    {component}:
      remoteWrite:
      - url: "https://remote-write-endpoint.example.com" 1
        <endpoint_authentication_credentials> 2
```

The URL of the remote write endpoint.
The authentication method and credentials for the endpoint.
Currently supported authentication methods are AWS Signature Version 4, authentication using HTTP in an Authorization request header, Basic authentication, OAuth 2.0, and TLS client.
See Supported remote write authentication settings for sample configurations of supported authentication methods.
3. Add write relabel configuration values after the authentication credentials:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {configmap-name}
  namespace: {namespace-name}
data:
  config.yaml: |
    {component}:
      remoteWrite:
      - url: "https://remote-write-endpoint.example.com"
        <endpoint_authentication_credentials>
        writeRelabelConfigs:
        - <your_write_relabel_configs> 1
```

Add configuration for metrics that you want to send to the remote endpoint.
Example of forwarding a single metric called my_metric

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {configmap-name}
  namespace: {namespace-name}
data:
  config.yaml: |
    {component}:
      remoteWrite:
      - url: "https://remote-write-endpoint.example.com"
        writeRelabelConfigs:
        - sourceLabels: [__name__]
          regex: 'my_metric'
          action: keep
```

Example of forwarding metrics called my_metric_1 and my_metric_2 in my_namespace namespace

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {configmap-name}
  namespace: {namespace-name}
data:
  config.yaml: |
    {component}:
      remoteWrite:
      - url: "https://remote-write-endpoint.example.com"
        writeRelabelConfigs:
        - sourceLabels: [__name__,namespace]
          regex: '(my_metric_1|my_metric_2);my_namespace'
          action: keep
```

4. Save the file to apply the changes. The new configuration is applied automatically.

data:
  config.yaml: |
    {component}:
      remoteWrite:
      - url: "https://remote-write-endpoint.example.com"
        <endpoint_authentication_credentials>
        queueConfig:
          capacity: 10000 1
          minShards: 1 2
          maxShards: 50 3
          maxSamplesPerSend: 2000 4
          batchSendDeadline: 5s 5
          minBackoff: 30ms 6

## Table of remote write metrics

The following table contains remote write and remote write-adjacent metrics with further description to help solve issues during remote write configuration.



# Creating cluster ID labels for metrics

You can create cluster ID labels for metrics by adding the write_relabel settings for remote write storage in the {configmap-name} config map in the {namespace-name} namespace.


[NOTE]
----
When Prometheus scrapes user workload targets that expose a namespace label, the system stores this label as exported_namespace.
This behavior ensures that the final namespace label value is equal to the namespace of the target pod.
You cannot override this default configuration by setting the value of the honorLabels field to true for PodMonitor or ServiceMonitor objects.
----

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role, or as a user with the user-workload-monitoring-config-edit role in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project.
* A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have configured remote write storage.

1. Edit the {configmap-name} config map in the {namespace-name} project:

```terminal
$ oc -n {namespace-name} edit configmap {configmap-name}
```

2. In the writeRelabelConfigs: section under data/config.yaml/{component}/remoteWrite, add cluster ID relabel configuration values:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {configmap-name}
  namespace: {namespace-name}
data:
  config.yaml: |
    {component}:
      remoteWrite:
      - url: "https://remote-write-endpoint.example.com"
        <endpoint_authentication_credentials>
        writeRelabelConfigs: 1
          - <relabel_config> 2
```

Add a list of write relabel configurations for metrics that you want to send to the remote endpoint.
Substitute the label configuration for the metrics sent to the remote write endpoint.

The following sample shows how to forward a metric with the cluster ID label cluster_id:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {configmap-name}
  namespace: {namespace-name}
data:
  config.yaml: |
    {component}:
      remoteWrite:
      - url: "https://remote-write-endpoint.example.com"
        writeRelabelConfigs:
        - sourceLabels:
          - __tmp_openshift_cluster_id__ 1
          targetLabel: cluster_id 2
          action: replace 3
```

The system initially applies a temporary cluster ID source label named __tmp_openshift_cluster_id__. This temporary label gets replaced by the cluster ID label name that you specify.
Specify the name of the cluster ID label for metrics sent to remote write storage.
If you use a label name that already exists for a metric, that value is overwritten with the name of this cluster ID label.
For the label name, do not use __tmp_openshift_cluster_id__. The final relabeling step removes labels that use this name.
The replace write relabel action replaces the temporary label with the target label for outgoing metrics.
This action is the default and is applied if no action is specified.
3. Save the file to apply the changes. The new configuration is applied automatically.

* Obtaining your cluster ID

# Setting up metrics collection for user-defined projects

You can create a ServiceMonitor resource to scrape metrics from a service endpoint in a user-defined project. This assumes that your application uses a Prometheus client library to expose metrics to the /metrics canonical name.

This section describes how to deploy a sample service in a user-defined project and then create a ServiceMonitor resource that defines how that service should be monitored.

## Deploying a sample service

To test monitoring of a service in a user-defined project, you can deploy a sample service.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role or as a user with administrative permissions for the namespace.

1. Create a YAML file for the service configuration. In this example, it is called prometheus-example-app.yaml.
2. Add the following deployment and service configuration details to the file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: ns1
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: prometheus-example-app
  name: prometheus-example-app
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: prometheus-example-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: prometheus-example-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: ghcr.io/rhobs/prometheus-example-app:0.4.2
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        name: prometheus-example-app
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: prometheus-example-app
  name: prometheus-example-app
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 8080
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 8080
    name: web
  selector:
    app: prometheus-example-app
  type: ClusterIP
```


This configuration deploys a service named prometheus-example-app in the user-defined ns1 project. This service exposes the custom version metric.
3. Apply the configuration to the cluster:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f prometheus-example-app.yaml
```


It takes some time to deploy the service.
4. You can check that the pod is running:

```terminal
$ oc -n ns1 get pod
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                                      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
prometheus-example-app-7857545cb7-sbgwq   1/1       Running   0          81m
```


## Specifying how a service is monitored

To use the metrics exposed by your service, you must configure Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring to scrape metrics from the /metrics endpoint. You can do this using a ServiceMonitor custom resource definition (CRD) that specifies how a service should be monitored, or a PodMonitor CRD that specifies how a pod should be monitored. The former requires a Service object, while the latter does not, allowing Prometheus to directly scrape metrics from the metrics endpoint exposed by a pod.

This procedure shows you how to create a ServiceMonitor resource for a service in a user-defined project.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role or the monitoring-edit cluster role.
* You have enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* For this example, you have deployed the prometheus-example-app sample service in the ns1 project.

[NOTE]
----
The prometheus-example-app sample service does not support TLS authentication.
----

1. Create a new YAML configuration file named example-app-service-monitor.yaml.
2. Add a ServiceMonitor resource to the YAML file. The following example creates a service monitor named prometheus-example-monitor to scrape metrics exposed by the prometheus-example-app service in the ns1 namespace:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: prometheus-example-monitor
  namespace: ns1 1
spec:
  endpoints:
  - interval: 30s
    port: web 2
    scheme: http
  selector: 3
    matchLabels:
      app: prometheus-example-app
```

Specify a user-defined namespace where your service runs.
Specify endpoint ports to be scraped by Prometheus.
Configure a selector to match your service based on its metadata labels.

[NOTE]
----
A ServiceMonitor resource in a user-defined namespace can only discover services in the same namespace. That is, the namespaceSelector field of the ServiceMonitor resource is always ignored.
----
3. Apply the configuration to the cluster:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f example-app-service-monitor.yaml
```


It takes some time to deploy the ServiceMonitor resource.
4. Verify that the ServiceMonitor resource is running:

```terminal
$ oc -n <namespace> get servicemonitor
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                         AGE
prometheus-example-monitor   81m
```


## Example service endpoint authentication settings

You can configure authentication for service endpoints for user-defined project monitoring by using ServiceMonitor and PodMonitor custom resource definitions (CRDs).

The following samples show different authentication settings for a ServiceMonitor resource.
Each sample shows how to configure a corresponding Secret object that contains authentication credentials and other relevant settings.

### Sample YAML authentication with a bearer token

  name: example-bearer-auth
  namespace: ns1
stringData:
  token: <authentication_token> 1
```


Specify an authentication token.

The following sample shows bearer token authentication settings for a ServiceMonitor CRD. The example uses a Secret object named example-bearer-auth:


```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: prometheus-example-monitor
  namespace: ns1
spec:

    matchLabels:
      app: prometheus-example-app
```


The key that contains the authentication token in the specified Secret object.
The name of the Secret object that contains the authentication credentials.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not use bearerTokenFile to configure bearer token. If you use the bearerTokenFile configuration, the ServiceMonitor resource is rejected.
----

### Sample YAML for Basic authentication

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: example-basic-auth
  namespace: ns1
stringData:
  user: <basic_username> 1
  password: <basic_password>  2
```


Specify a username for authentication.
Specify a password for authentication.

The following sample shows Basic authentication settings for a ServiceMonitor CRD. The example uses a Secret object named example-basic-auth:


```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: prometheus-example-monitor
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  endpoints:
  - basicAuth:
      username:
        key: user 1
        name: example-basic-auth 2
      password:
        key: password 3

  secret: <oauth2_secret> 2
```


Specify an Oauth 2.0 ID.
Specify an Oauth 2.0 secret.

The following sample shows OAuth 2.0 authentication settings for a ServiceMonitor CRD. The example uses a Secret object named example-oauth2:


```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: prometheus-example-monitor
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  endpoints:
  - oauth2:
      clientId:
