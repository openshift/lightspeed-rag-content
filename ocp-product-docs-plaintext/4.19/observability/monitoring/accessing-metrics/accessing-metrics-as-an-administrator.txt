# Accessing metrics as an administrator


You can access metrics to monitor the performance of cluster components and your workloads.
* Understanding metrics

# Viewing a list of available metrics

As a cluster administrator or as a user with view permissions for all projects, you can view a list of metrics available in a cluster and output the list in JSON format.

* You are a cluster administrator, or you have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-monitoring-view cluster role.
* You have installed the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI (oc).
* You have obtained the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform API route for Thanos Querier.
* You are able to get a bearer token by using the oc whoami -t command.

[IMPORTANT]
----
You can only use bearer token authentication to access the Thanos Querier API route.
----

1. If you have not obtained the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform API route for Thanos Querier, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get routes -n openshift-monitoring thanos-querier -o jsonpath='{.status.ingress[0].host}'
```

2. Retrieve a list of metrics in JSON format from the Thanos Querier API route by running the following command. This command uses oc to authenticate with a bearer token.

```terminal
$ curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer $(oc whoami -t)" https://<thanos_querier_route>/api/v1/metadata 1
```

Replace <thanos_querier_route> with the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform API route for Thanos Querier.

# Querying metrics for all projects with the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console

You can use the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform metrics query browser to run Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) queries to examine metrics visualized on a plot. This functionality provides information about the state of a cluster and any user-defined workloads that you are monitoring.

As a
cluster administrator
or as a user with view permissions for all projects, you can access metrics for all default Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and user-defined projects in the Metrics UI.

The Metrics UI includes predefined queries, for example, CPU, memory, bandwidth, or network packet for all projects. You can also run custom Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) queries.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role or with view permissions for all projects.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, click Observe -> Metrics.
2. To add one or more queries, perform any of the following actions:

3. To run queries that you created, click Run queries. The metrics from the queries are visualized on the plot. If a query is invalid, the UI shows an error message.

[NOTE]
----
* When drawing time series graphs, queries that operate on large amounts of data might time out or overload the browser. To avoid this, click Hide graph and calibrate your query by using only the metrics table. Then, after finding a feasible query, enable the plot to draw the graphs.
* By default, the query table shows an expanded view that lists every metric and its current value. Click the Ë… down arrowhead to minimize the expanded view for a query.
----
4. Optional: Save the page URL to use this set of queries again in the future.
5. Explore the visualized metrics. Initially, all metrics from all enabled queries are shown on the plot. Select which metrics are shown by performing any of the following actions:


* Querying Prometheus (Prometheus documentation)

# Getting detailed information about a metrics target

You can use the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console to view, search, and filter the endpoints that are currently targeted for scraping, which helps you to identify and troubleshoot problems. For example, you can view the current status of targeted endpoints to see when Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring is not able to scrape metrics from a targeted component.

The Metrics targets page shows targets for default Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform projects and for user-defined projects.

* You have access to the cluster as an administrator for the project for which you want to view metrics targets.

1. In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, go to Observe -> Targets. The Metrics targets page opens with a list of all service endpoint targets that are being scraped for metrics.

This page shows details about targets for default Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and user-defined projects. This page lists the following information for each target:
* Service endpoint URL being scraped
* The ServiceMonitor resource being monitored
* The up or down status of the target
* Namespace
* Last scrape time
* Duration of the last scrape
2. Optional: To find a specific target, perform any of the following actions:

3. Click the URL in the Endpoint column for a target to go to its Target details page. This page provides information about the target, including the following information:
* The endpoint URL being scraped for metrics
* The current Up or Down status of the target
* A link to the namespace
* A link to the ServiceMonitor resource details
* Labels attached to the target
* The most recent time that the target was scraped for metrics

# Reviewing monitoring dashboards as a cluster administrator

As an administrator, you can view dashboards relating to core Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster components.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Starting with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19, the perspectives in the web console have unified. The Developer perspective is no longer enabled by default.
All users can interact with all
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
web console features. However, if you are not the cluster owner, you might need to request permission to certain features from the cluster owner.
You can still enable the Developer perspective. On the Getting Started pane in the web console, you can take a tour of the console, find information on setting up your cluster, view a quick start for enabling the Developer perspective, and follow links to explore new features and capabilities.
----

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role.

1. In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, go to Observe -> Dashboards.
2. Choose a dashboard in the Dashboard list. Some dashboards, such as etcd and Prometheus dashboards, produce additional sub-menus when selected.
3. Optional: Select a time range for the graphs in the Time Range list.
* Select a pre-defined time period.
* Set a custom time range by clicking Custom time range in the Time Range list.
1. Input or select the From and To dates and times.
2. Click Save to save the custom time range.
4. Optional: Select a Refresh Interval.
5. Hover over each of the graphs within a dashboard to display detailed information about specific items.
