# Accessing metrics as a developer


You can access metrics to monitor the performance of your cluster workloads.
* Understanding metrics

# Viewing a list of available metrics

As a cluster administrator or as a user with view permissions for all projects, you can view a list of metrics available in a cluster and output the list in JSON format.

* You are a cluster administrator, or you have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-monitoring-view cluster role.
* You have installed the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI (oc).
* You have obtained the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform API route for Thanos Querier.
* You are able to get a bearer token by using the oc whoami -t command.

[IMPORTANT]
----
You can only use bearer token authentication to access the Thanos Querier API route.
----

1. If you have not obtained the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform API route for Thanos Querier, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get routes -n openshift-monitoring thanos-querier -o jsonpath='{.status.ingress[0].host}'
```

2. Retrieve a list of metrics in JSON format from the Thanos Querier API route by running the following command. This command uses oc to authenticate with a bearer token.

```terminal
$ curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer $(oc whoami -t)" https://<thanos_querier_route>/api/v1/metadata 1
```

Replace <thanos_querier_route> with the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform API route for Thanos Querier.

# Querying metrics for user-defined projects with the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console

You can use the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform metrics query browser to run Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) queries to examine metrics visualized on a plot. This functionality provides information about any user-defined workloads that you are monitoring.

As a developer, you must specify a project name when querying metrics. You must have the required privileges to view metrics for the selected project.

The Metrics UI includes predefined queries, for example, CPU, memory, bandwidth, or network packet. These queries are restricted to the selected project. You can also run custom Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) queries for the project.

* You have access to the cluster as a developer or as a user with view permissions for the project that you are viewing metrics for.
* You have enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You have deployed a service in a user-defined project.
* You have created a ServiceMonitor custom resource definition (CRD) for the service to define how the service is monitored.

1. In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, click Observe -> Metrics.
2. To add one or more queries, perform any of the following actions:

3. To run queries that you created, click Run queries. The metrics from the queries are visualized on the plot. If a query is invalid, the UI shows an error message.

[NOTE]
----
* When drawing time series graphs, queries that operate on large amounts of data might time out or overload the browser. To avoid this, click Hide graph and calibrate your query by using only the metrics table. Then, after finding a feasible query, enable the plot to draw the graphs.
* By default, the query table shows an expanded view that lists every metric and its current value. Click the ˅ down arrowhead to minimize the expanded view for a query.
----
4. Optional: Save the page URL to use this set of queries again in the future.
5. Explore the visualized metrics. Initially, all metrics from all enabled queries are shown on the plot. Select which metrics are shown by performing any of the following actions:


* Querying Prometheus (Prometheus documentation)

# Reviewing monitoring dashboards as a developer

As a developer, you can view dashboards relating to projects you have permissions for.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Starting with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19, the perspectives in the web console have unified. The Developer perspective is no longer enabled by default.
All users can interact with all
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
web console features. However, if you are not the cluster owner, you might need to request permission to certain features from the cluster owner.
You can still enable the Developer perspective. On the Getting Started pane in the web console, you can take a tour of the console, find information on setting up your cluster, view a quick start for enabling the Developer perspective, and follow links to explore new features and capabilities.
----

* You have access to the cluster as a developer or as a user.
* You have view permissions for the project that you are viewing the dashboard for.
* A cluster administrator has enabled the Developer perspective in the web console.

1. In the the Developer perspective of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, click Observe and go to the Dashboards tab.
2. Select a project from the Project: drop-down list.
3. Select a dashboard from the Dashboard drop-down list to see the filtered metrics.
4. Optional: Select a time range for the graphs in the Time Range list.
* Select a predefined time period.
* Set a custom time range by clicking Custom time range in the Time Range list.
1. Input or select the From and To dates and times.
2. Click Save to save the custom time range.
5. Optional: Select a Refresh Interval.
6. Hover over each of the graphs within a dashboard to display detailed information about specific items.
