# Converting a connected cluster to a disconnected cluster


There might be some scenarios where you need to convert your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster from a connected cluster to a disconnected cluster.
A disconnected cluster, also known as a restricted cluster, does not have an active connection to the internet. As such, you must mirror the contents of your registries and installation media. You can create this mirror registry on a host that can access both the internet and your closed network, or copy images to a device that you can move across network boundaries.
This topic describes the general process for converting an existing, connected cluster into a disconnected cluster.

# About the mirror registry

You can mirror the images that are required for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation and subsequent product updates to a container mirror registry such as Red Hat Quay, JFrog Artifactory, Sonatype Nexus Repository, or Harbor. If you do not have access to a large-scale container registry, you can use the mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift, a small-scale container registry included with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform subscriptions.

You can use any container registry that supports Docker v2-2, such as Red Hat Quay, the mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift, Artifactory, Sonatype Nexus Repository, or Harbor. Regardless of your chosen registry, the procedure to mirror content from Red Hat hosted sites on the internet to an isolated image registry is the same. After you mirror the content, you configure each cluster to retrieve this content from your mirror registry.


[IMPORTANT]
----
The OpenShift image registry cannot be used as the target registry because it does not support pushing without a tag, which is required during the mirroring process.
----

If choosing a container registry that is not the mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift, it must be reachable by every machine in the clusters that you provision. If the registry is unreachable, installation, updating, or normal operations such as workload relocation might fail. For that reason, you must run mirror registries in a highly available way, and the mirror registries must at least match the production availability of your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters.

When you populate your mirror registry with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform images, you can follow two scenarios. If you have a host that can access both the internet and your mirror registry, but not your cluster nodes, you can directly mirror the content from that machine. This process is referred to as connected mirroring. If you have no such host, you must mirror the images to a file system and then bring that host or removable media into your restricted environment. This process is referred to as disconnected mirroring.

For mirrored registries, to view the source of pulled images, you must review the Trying to access log entry in the CRI-O logs. Other methods to view the image pull source, such as using the crictl images command on a node, show the non-mirrored image name, even though the image is pulled from the mirrored location.


[NOTE]
----
Red Hat does not test third party registries with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
----

# Prerequisites

* The oc client is installed.
* A running cluster.
* An installed mirror registry, which is a container image registry that supports Docker v2-2 in the location that will host the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, such as one of the following registries:
* Red Hat Quay
* JFrog Artifactory
* Sonatype Nexus Repository
* Harbor

If you have a subscription to Red&#160;Hat Quay, see the documentation on deploying Red&#160;Hat Quay for proof-of-concept purposes or by using the Quay Operator.
* The mirror repository must be configured to share images. For example, a Red Hat Quay repository requires Organizations in order to share images.
* Access to the internet to obtain the necessary container images.

# Preparing the cluster for mirroring

Before disconnecting your cluster, you must mirror, or copy, the images to a mirror registry that is reachable by every node in your disconnected cluster. In order to mirror the images, you must prepare your cluster by:

* Adding the mirror registry certificates to the list of trusted CAs on your host.
* Creating a .dockerconfigjson file that contains your image pull secret, which is from the cloud.openshift.com token.

1. Configuring credentials that allow image mirroring:
1. Add the CA certificate for the mirror registry, in the simple PEM or DER file formats, to the list of trusted CAs. For example:

```terminal
$ cp </path/to/cert.crt> /usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source/anchors/
```

where, </path/to/cert.crt>:: Specifies the path to the certificate on your local file system.
2. Update the CA trust. For example, in Linux:

```terminal
$ update-ca-trust
```

3. Extract the .dockerconfigjson file from the global pull secret:

```terminal
$ oc extract secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config --confirm --to=.
```

Example output

```terminal
.dockerconfigjson
```

4. Edit the .dockerconfigjson file to add your mirror registry and authentication credentials and save it as a new file:

```terminal
{"auths":{"<local_registry>": {"auth": "<credentials>","email": "you@example.com"}}},"<registry>:<port>/<namespace>/":{"auth":"<token>"}}}
```


where:
<local_registry>:: Specifies the registry domain name, and optionally the port, that your mirror registry uses to serve content.
auth:: Specifies the base64-encoded user name and password for your mirror registry.
<registry>:<port>/<namespace>:: Specifies the mirror registry details.
<token>:: Specifies  the base64-encoded username:password for your mirror registry.

For example:

```terminal
$ {"auths":{"cloud.openshift.com":{"auth":"b3BlbnNoaWZ0Y3UjhGOVZPT0lOMEFaUjdPUzRGTA==","email":"user@example.com"},
"quay.io":{"auth":"b3BlbnNoaWZ0LXJlbGVhc2UtZGOVZPT0lOMEFaUGSTd4VGVGVUjdPUzRGTA==","email":"user@example.com"},
"registry.connect.redhat.com"{"auth":"NTE3MTMwNDB8dWhjLTFEZlN3VHkxOSTd4VGVGVU1MdTpleUpoYkdjaUailA==","email":"user@example.com"},
"registry.redhat.io":{"auth":"NTE3MTMwNDB8dWhjLTFEZlN3VH3BGSTd4VGVGVU1MdTpleUpoYkdjaU9fZw==","email":"user@example.com"},
"registry.svc.ci.openshift.org":{"auth":"dXNlcjpyWjAwWVFjSEJiT2RKVW1pSmg4dW92dGp1SXRxQ3RGN1pwajJhN1ZXeTRV"},"my-registry:5000/my-namespace/":{"auth":"dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ="}}}
```


# Mirroring the images

After the cluster is properly configured, you can mirror the images from your external repositories to the mirror repository.

1. Mirror the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) images:

```terminal
$ oc adm catalog mirror registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v{product-version} <mirror_registry>:<port>/olm -a <reg_creds>
```

where:
product-version:: Specifies the tag that corresponds to the version of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform to install, such as 4.8.
mirror_registry:: Specifies the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the target registry and namespace to mirror the Operator content to, where <namespace> is any existing namespace on the registry.
reg_creds:: Specifies the location of your modified .dockerconfigjson file.

For example:

```terminal
$ oc adm catalog mirror registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.8 mirror.registry.com:443/olm -a ./.dockerconfigjson  --index-filter-by-os='.*'
```

2. Mirror the content for any other Red Hat-provided Operator:

```terminal
$ oc adm catalog mirror <index_image> <mirror_registry>:<port>/<namespace> -a <reg_creds>
```

where:
index_image:: Specifies the index image for the catalog that you want to mirror.
mirror_registry:: Specifies the FQDN for the target registry and namespace to mirror the Operator content to, where <namespace> is any existing namespace on the registry.
reg_creds:: Optional: Specifies the location of your registry credentials file, if required.

For example:

```terminal
$ oc adm catalog mirror registry.redhat.io/redhat/community-operator-index:v4.8 mirror.registry.com:443/olm -a ./.dockerconfigjson  --index-filter-by-os='.*'
```

3. Mirror the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform image repository:

```terminal
$ oc adm release mirror -a .dockerconfigjson --from=quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:v<product-version>-<architecture> --to=<local_registry>/<local_repository> --to-release-image=<local_registry>/<local_repository>:v<product-version>-<architecture>
```

where:
product-version:: Specifies the tag that corresponds to the version of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform to install, such as 4.8.15-x86_64.
architecture:: Specifies the type of architecture for your server, such as x86_64.
local_registry:: Specifies the registry domain name for your mirror repository.
local_repository:: Specifies the name of the repository to create in your registry, such as ocp4/openshift4.

For example:

```terminal
$ oc adm release mirror -a .dockerconfigjson --from=quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:4.8.15-x86_64 --to=mirror.registry.com:443/ocp/release --to-release-image=mirror.registry.com:443/ocp/release:4.8.15-x86_64
```

Example output

```terminal

4. Mirror any other registries, as needed:

```terminal
$ oc image mirror <online_registry>/my/image:latest <mirror_registry>
```

* For more information about the oc adm catalog mirror command, see the OpenShift CLI administrator command reference.

# Configuring the cluster for the mirror registry

After creating and mirroring the images to the mirror registry, you must modify your cluster so that pods can pull images from the mirror registry.

You must:

* Add the mirror registry credentials to the global pull secret.
* Add the mirror registry server certificate to the cluster.
* Create an ImageContentSourcePolicy custom resource (ICSP), which associates the mirror registry with the source registry.
1. Add mirror registry credential to the cluster global pull-secret:

```terminal
$ oc set data secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=<pull_secret_location> 1
```

Provide the path to the new pull secret file.

For example:

```terminal
$ oc set data secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=.mirrorsecretconfigjson
```

2. Add the CA-signed mirror registry server certificate to the nodes in the cluster:
1. Create a config map that includes the server certificate for the mirror registry

```terminal
$ oc create configmap <config_map_name> --from-file=<mirror_address_host>..<port>=$path/ca.crt -n openshift-config
```


For example:

```terminal
S oc create configmap registry-config --from-file=mirror.registry.com..443=/root/certs/ca-chain.cert.pem -n openshift-config
```

2. Use the config map to update the image.config.openshift.io/cluster custom resource (CR). Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform applies the changes to this CR to all nodes in the cluster:

```terminal
$ oc patch image.config.openshift.io/cluster --patch '{"spec":{"additionalTrustedCA":{"name":"<config_map_name>"}}}' --type=merge
```


For example:

```terminal
$ oc patch image.config.openshift.io/cluster --patch '{"spec":{"additionalTrustedCA":{"name":"registry-config"}}}' --type=merge
```

3. Create an ICSP to redirect container pull requests from the online registries to the mirror registry:
1. Create the ImageContentSourcePolicy custom resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ImageContentSourcePolicy
metadata:
  name: mirror-ocp
spec:
  repositoryDigestMirrors:
  - mirrors:
    - mirror.registry.com:443/ocp/release 1
    source: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release 2
  - mirrors:
    - mirror.registry.com:443/ocp/release
    source: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-art-dev
```

Specifies the name of the mirror image registry and repository.
Specifies the online registry and repository containing the content that is mirrored.
2. Create the ICSP object:

```terminal
$ oc create -f registryrepomirror.yaml
```

Example output

```terminal
imagecontentsourcepolicy.operator.openshift.io/mirror-ocp created
```


Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform applies the changes to this CR to all nodes in the cluster.
4. Verify that the credentials, CA, and ICSP for mirror registry were added:
1. Log into a node:

```terminal
$ oc debug node/<node_name>
```

2. Set /host as the root directory within the debug shell:

```terminal
sh-4.4# chroot /host
```

3. Check the config.json file for the credentials:

```terminal
sh-4.4# cat /var/lib/kubelet/config.json
```

Example output

```terminal
{"auths":{"brew.registry.redhat.io":{"xx=="},"brewregistry.stage.redhat.io":{"auth":"xxx=="},"mirror.registry.com:443":{"auth":"xx="}}} 1
```

Ensure that the mirror registry and credentials are present.
4. Change to the certs.d directory

```terminal
sh-4.4# cd /etc/docker/certs.d/
```

5. List the certificates in the certs.d directory:

```terminal
sh-4.4# ls
```

Example output

```
image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc.cluster.local:5000
image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000
mirror.registry.com:443 1
```

Ensure that the mirror registry is in the list.
6. Check that the ICSP added the mirror registry to the registries.conf file:

```terminal
sh-4.4# cat /etc/containers/registries.conf
```

Example output

```terminal
unqualified-search-registries = ["registry.access.redhat.com", "docker.io"]

[[registry]]
  prefix = ""
  location = "quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release"
  mirror-by-digest-only = true

  [[registry.mirror]]
    location = "mirror.registry.com:443/ocp/release"

[[registry]]
  prefix = ""
  location = "quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-art-dev"
  mirror-by-digest-only = true

  [[registry.mirror]]
    location = "mirror.registry.com:443/ocp/release"
```


The registry.mirror parameters indicate that the mirror registry is searched before the original registry.
7. Exit the node.

```terminal
sh-4.4# exit
```


# Ensure applications continue to work

Before disconnecting the cluster from the network, ensure that your cluster is working as expected and all of your applications are working as expected.

Use the following commands to check the status of your cluster:

* Ensure your pods are running:

```terminal
$ oc get pods --all-namespaces
```

Example output

```terminal
NAMESPACE                                          NAME                                                          READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE

 ...
```

* Ensure your nodes are in the READY status:

```terminal
$ oc get nodes
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                                       STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION

```


# Disconnect the cluster from the network

After mirroring all the required repositories and configuring your cluster to work as a disconnected cluster, you can disconnect the cluster from the network.


[NOTE]
----
The Insights Operator is degraded when the cluster loses its Internet connection. You can avoid this problem by temporarily disabling the Insights Operator until you can restore it.
----

# Restoring a degraded Insights Operator

Disconnecting the cluster from the network necessarily causes the cluster to lose the Internet connection. The Insights Operator becomes degraded because it requires access to Red Hat Insights.

This topic describes how to recover from a degraded Insights Operator.

1. Edit your .dockerconfigjson file to remove the cloud.openshift.com entry, for example:

```terminal
"cloud.openshift.com":{"auth":"<hash>","email":"user@example.com"}
```

2. Save the file.
3. Update the cluster secret with the edited .dockerconfigjson file:

```terminal
$ oc set data secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=./.dockerconfigjson
```

4. Verify that the Insights Operator is no longer degraded:

```terminal
$ oc get co insights
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME       VERSION   AVAILABLE   PROGRESSING   DEGRADED   SINCE
insights   4.5.41    True        False         False      3d
```


# Restoring the network

If you want to reconnect a disconnected cluster and pull images from online registries, delete the cluster&#8217;s ImageContentSourcePolicy (ICSP) objects. Without the ICSP, pull requests to external registries are no longer redirected to the mirror registry.

1. View the ICSP objects in your cluster:

```terminal
$ oc get imagecontentsourcepolicy
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                 AGE
mirror-ocp           6d20h
ocp4-index-0         6d18h
qe45-index-0         6d15h
```

2. Delete all the ICSP objects you created when disconnecting your cluster:

```terminal
$ oc delete imagecontentsourcepolicy <icsp_name> <icsp_name> <icsp_name>
```


For example:

```terminal
$ oc delete imagecontentsourcepolicy mirror-ocp ocp4-index-0 qe45-index-0
```

Example output

```terminal
imagecontentsourcepolicy.operator.openshift.io "mirror-ocp" deleted
imagecontentsourcepolicy.operator.openshift.io "ocp4-index-0" deleted
imagecontentsourcepolicy.operator.openshift.io "qe45-index-0" deleted
```

3. Wait for all the nodes to restart and return to the READY status and verify that the registries.conf file is pointing to the original registries and not the mirror registries:
1. Log into a node:

```terminal
$ oc debug node/<node_name>
```

2. Set /host as the root directory within the debug shell:

```terminal
sh-4.4# chroot /host
```

3. Examine the registries.conf file:

```terminal
sh-4.4# cat /etc/containers/registries.conf
```

Example output

```terminal
unqualified-search-registries = ["registry.access.redhat.com", "docker.io"] 1
```

The registry and registry.mirror entries created by the ICSPs you deleted are removed.
