# Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager

Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager is a managed service where you can install, modify, operate, and upgrade your Red Hat OpenShift clusters. This service allows you to work with all of your organizationâ€™s clusters from a single dashboard.
OpenShift Cluster Manager guides you to install OpenShift Container Platform, Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA), and {product-short-name} clusters. It is also responsible for managing both OpenShift Container Platform clusters after self-installation as well as your ROSA and {product-short-name} clusters.
You can use OpenShift Cluster Manager to do the following actions:
* Create new clusters
* View cluster details and metrics
* Manage your clusters with tasks such as scaling, changing node labels, networking, authentication
* Manage access control
* Monitor clusters
* Schedule upgrades

# Accessing Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager

You can access OpenShift Cluster Manager with your configured OpenShift account.

* You have an account that is part of an OpenShift organization.
* If you are creating a cluster, your organization has a specified quota.

* Log in to OpenShift Cluster Manager using your login credentials.

# General actions

On the top right of the cluster page, there are some actions that a user can perform on the entire cluster:

* Open console launches a web console so that the cluster owner can issue commands to the cluster.
* Actions drop-down menu allows the cluster owner to rename the display name of the cluster, change the amount of load balancers and persistent storage on the cluster, if applicable, manually set the node count, and delete the cluster.
* Refresh icon forces a refresh of the cluster.

# Cluster tabs

Selecting an active, installed cluster shows tabs associated with that cluster. The following tabs display after the cluster&#8217;s installation completes:

* Overview
* Access control
* Add-ons
* Networking
* Insights Advisor
* Machine pools
* Support
* Settings

## Overview tab

The Overview tab provides information about how the cluster was configured:

* Cluster ID is the unique identification for the created cluster. This ID can be used when issuing commands to the cluster from the command line.
* Domain prefix is the prefix that is used throughout the cluster. The default value is the cluster's name.
* Type shows the type of cluster, for example ROSA (classic), ROSA with HCP, or Dedicated.
* Control plane type is the architecture type of the cluster. The field only displays if the cluster uses a hosted control plane architecture.
* Region is the server region.
* Version is the OpenShift version that is installed on the cluster. If there is an update available, you can update from this field.
* Created at shows the date and time that the cluster was created.
* Owner identifies who created the cluster and has owner rights.
* Delete Protection: <status> shows whether or not the cluster's delete protection is enabled.
* Total vCPU shows the total available virtual CPU for this cluster.
* Total memory shows the total available memory for this cluster.
* Infrastructure AWS account displays the AWS account that is responsible for cluster creation and maintenance.
* Nodes shows the actual and desired nodes on the cluster. These numbers might not match due to cluster scaling.
* Network field shows the address and prefixes for network connectivity.
* OIDC configuration field shows the Open ID Connect configuration for the cluster.
* Resource usage section of the tab displays the resources in use with a graph.
* Advisor recommendations section gives insight in relation to security, performance, availability, and stability. This section requires the use of remote health functionality. See Using Insights to identify issues with the cluster in the Additional resources section.

## Access control tab

The Access control tab allows the cluster owner to set up an identity provider, grant elevated permissions, and grant roles to other users.

### Identity providers

You can create your cluster&#8217;s identity provider in this section. See the Additional resources for more information.

### Cluster roles and acess

You can create a dedicated-admins role for {product-short-name} clusters or cluster-admins role for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters.

1. Click the Add user button.
2. Enter the ID of the user you want to grant cluster admin access.
3. Select the appropriate group for your user. Either dedicated-admins for {product-short-name} clusters, or cluster-admins for
clusters.

### OCM roles and access

* You must be the cluster owner or have the correct permissions to grant roles on the cluster.

1. Click the Grant role button.
2. Enter the Red Hat account login for the user that you wish to grant a role on the cluster.
3. Select the role from following options:
* Cluster editor allows users or groups to manage or configure the cluster.
* Cluster viewer allows users or groups to view cluster details only.
* Identity provider editor allows users or groups to manage and configure the identity providers.
* Machine pool editor allows users or groups to manage and configure the machine pools.
4. Click the Grant role button on the dialog box.

## Add-ons tab



## Insights Advisor tab

The Insights Advisor tab uses the Remote Health functionality of the OpenShift Container Platform to identify and mitigate risks to security, performance, availability, and stability. See Using Insights to identify issues with your cluster in the OpenShift Container Platform documentation.

## Machine pools tab

The Machine pools tab allows the cluster owner to create new machine pools if there is enough available quota, or edit an existing machine pool.

Selecting the  &gt; Edit option opens the "Edit machine pool" dialog. In this dialog, you can change the node count per availability zone, edit node labels and taints, and view any associated AWS security groups.

## Support tab

In the Support tab, you can add notification contacts for individuals that should receive cluster notifications. The username or email address that you provide must relate to a user account in the Red Hat organization where the cluster is deployed.

Also from this tab, you can open a support case to request technical support for your cluster.

## Settings tab

The Settings tab provides a few options for the cluster owner:

* Update strategy allows you to determine if the cluster automatically updates on a certain day of the week at a specified time or if all updates are scheduled manually.
* Update status shows the current version and if there are any updates available.
