# Syncing LDAP groups


you can use groups to manage users, change
their permissions, and enhance collaboration. Your organization may have already
created user groups and stored them in an LDAP server. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform can sync
those LDAP records with internal Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform records, enabling you to manage
your groups in one place. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform currently supports group sync with
LDAP servers using three common schemas for defining group membership: RFC 2307,
Active Directory, and augmented Active Directory.
For more information on configuring LDAP, see
Configuring an LDAP identity provider.

# About configuring LDAP sync

Before you can run LDAP sync, you need a sync
configuration file. This file contains the following LDAP client configuration details:

* Configuration for connecting to your LDAP server.
* Sync configuration options that are dependent on the schema used in your LDAP
server.
* An administrator-defined list of name mappings that maps Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform group names to groups in your LDAP server.

The format of the configuration file depends upon the schema you are using: RFC 2307, Active Directory, or augmented Active Directory.

LDAP client configuration:: The LDAP client configuration section of the configuration defines the connections to your LDAP server.

The LDAP client configuration section of the configuration defines the connections to your LDAP server.


```yaml
url: ldap://10.0.0.0:389 1
bindDN: cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com 2
bindPassword: <password> 3
insecure: false 4
ca: my-ldap-ca-bundle.crt 5
```


The connection protocol, IP address of the LDAP server hosting your
database, and the port to connect to, formatted as scheme://host:port.
Optional distinguished name (DN) to use as the Bind DN.
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform uses this if elevated privilege is required to retrieve entries for
the sync operation.
Optional password to use to bind. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform uses this if elevated privilege is
necessary to retrieve entries for the sync operation. This value may also be
provided in an environment variable, external file, or encrypted file.
When false, secure
LDAP (ldaps://) URLs connect using TLS, and insecure LDAP (ldap://) URLs are
upgraded to TLS. When true, no TLS connection is made to the server and you cannot use ldaps:// URL schemes.
The certificate bundle to use for validating server certificates for the
configured URL. If empty, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform uses system-trusted roots. This only applies
if insecure is set to false.

LDAP query definition:: Sync configurations consist of LDAP query definitions for the entries that are
required for synchronization. The specific definition of an LDAP query depends
on the schema used to store membership information in the LDAP server.


```yaml
baseDN: ou=users,dc=example,dc=com 1
scope: sub 2
derefAliases: never 3
timeout: 0 4
filter: (objectClass=person) 5
pageSize: 0 6
```


The distinguished name (DN) of the branch of the directory where all
searches will start from. It is required that you specify the top of your
directory tree, but you can also specify a subtree in the directory.
The scope of the search. Valid values are base, one, or sub. If this
is left undefined, then a scope of sub is assumed. Descriptions of the scope
options can be found in the table below.
The behavior of the search with respect to aliases in the LDAP tree. Valid
values are never, search, base, or always. If this is left undefined,
then the default is to always dereference aliases. Descriptions of the
dereferencing behaviors can be found in the table below.
The time limit allowed for the search by the client, in seconds. A value of
0 imposes no client-side limit.
A valid LDAP search filter. If this is left undefined, then the default is
(objectClass=*).
The optional maximum size of response pages from the server, measured in LDAP
entries. If set to 0, no size restrictions will be made on pages of responses.
Setting paging sizes is necessary when queries return more entries than the
client or server allow by default.





User-defined name mapping:: A user-defined name mapping explicitly maps the names of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform groups to
unique identifiers that find groups on your LDAP server. The mapping uses normal
YAML syntax. A user-defined mapping can contain an entry for every group in your
LDAP server or only a subset of those groups. If there are groups on the LDAP
server that do not have a user-defined name mapping, the default behavior during
sync is to use the attribute specified as the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform group's name.


```yaml
groupUIDNameMapping:
  "cn=group1,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com": firstgroup
  "cn=group2,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com": secondgroup
  "cn=group3,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com": thirdgroup
```


## About the RFC 2307 configuration file

The RFC 2307 schema requires you to provide an LDAP query definition for both user
and group entries, as well as the attributes with which to represent them in the
internal Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform records.

For clarity, the group you create in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform should use attributes other
than the distinguished name whenever possible for user- or administrator-facing
fields. For example, identify the users of an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform group by their e-mail, and use the
name of the group as the common name. The following configuration file creates
these relationships:


[NOTE]
----
If using user-defined name mappings, your configuration file will differ.
----


```yaml
kind: LDAPSyncConfig
apiVersion: v1
url: ldap://LDAP_SERVICE_IP:389 1
insecure: false 2
bindDN: cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com
bindPassword:
  file: "/etc/secrets/bindPassword"
rfc2307:
    groupsQuery:
        baseDN: "ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com"
        scope: sub
        derefAliases: never
        pageSize: 0
    groupUIDAttribute: dn 3
    groupNameAttributes: [ cn ] 4
    groupMembershipAttributes: [ member ] 5
    usersQuery:
        baseDN: "ou=users,dc=example,dc=com"
        scope: sub
        derefAliases: never
        pageSize: 0
    userUIDAttribute: dn 6
    userNameAttributes: [ mail ] 7
    tolerateMemberNotFoundErrors: false
    tolerateMemberOutOfScopeErrors: false
```


The IP address and host of the LDAP server where this group's record is
stored.
When false, secure
LDAP (ldaps://) URLs connect using TLS, and insecure LDAP (ldap://) URLs are
upgraded to TLS. When true, no TLS connection is made to the server and you cannot use ldaps:// URL schemes.
The attribute that uniquely identifies a group on the LDAP server.
You cannot specify groupsQuery filters when using DN for groupUIDAttribute.
For fine-grained filtering, use the whitelist / blacklist method.
The attribute to use as the name of the group.
The attribute on the group that stores the membership information.
The attribute that uniquely identifies a user on the LDAP server. You
cannot specify usersQuery filters when using DN for userUIDAttribute. For
fine-grained  filtering, use the whitelist / blacklist method.
The attribute to use as the name of the user in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform group record.

## About the Active Directory configuration file

The Active Directory schema requires you to provide an LDAP query definition for
user entries, as well as the attributes to represent them with in the internal
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform group records.

For clarity, the group you create in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform should use attributes other
than the distinguished name whenever possible for user- or administrator-facing
fields. For example, identify the users of an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform group by their e-mail, but define
the name of the group by the name of the group on the LDAP server.
The following configuration file creates these relationships:


```yaml
kind: LDAPSyncConfig
apiVersion: v1
url: ldap://LDAP_SERVICE_IP:389
activeDirectory:
    usersQuery:
        baseDN: "ou=users,dc=example,dc=com"
        scope: sub
        derefAliases: never
        filter: (objectclass=person)
        pageSize: 0
    userNameAttributes: [ mail ] 1
    groupMembershipAttributes: [ memberOf ] 2
```


The attribute to use as the name of the user in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform group record.
The attribute on the user that stores the membership information.

## About the augmented Active Directory configuration file

The augmented Active Directory schema requires you to provide an LDAP query
definition for both user entries and group entries, as well as the attributes
with which to represent them in the internal Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform group records.

For clarity, the group you create in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform should use attributes other
than the distinguished name whenever possible for user- or administrator-facing
fields. For example, identify the users of an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform group by their e-mail,
and use the name of the group as the common name. The following configuration
file creates these relationships.


```yaml
kind: LDAPSyncConfig
apiVersion: v1
url: ldap://LDAP_SERVICE_IP:389
augmentedActiveDirectory:
    groupsQuery:
        baseDN: "ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com"
        scope: sub
        derefAliases: never
        pageSize: 0
    groupUIDAttribute: dn 1
    groupNameAttributes: [ cn ] 2
    usersQuery:
        baseDN: "ou=users,dc=example,dc=com"
        scope: sub
        derefAliases: never
        filter: (objectclass=person)
        pageSize: 0
    userNameAttributes: [ mail ] 3
    groupMembershipAttributes: [ memberOf ] 4
```


The attribute that uniquely identifies a group on the LDAP server. You
cannot specify groupsQuery filters when using DN for groupUIDAttribute. For
fine-grained filtering, use the whitelist / blacklist method.
The attribute to use as the name of the group.
The attribute to use as the name of the user in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform group record.
The attribute on the user that stores the membership information.

# Running LDAP sync

Once you have created a sync configuration file, you can begin to sync. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform allows administrators to perform a number of different sync types with the same server.

## Syncing the LDAP server with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

You can sync all groups from the LDAP server with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

* Create a sync configuration file.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

* To sync all groups from the LDAP server with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform:

```terminal
$ oc adm groups sync --sync-config=config.yaml --confirm
```


[NOTE]
----
By default, all group synchronization operations are dry-run, so you
must set the --confirm flag on the oc adm groups sync command to make
changes to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform group records.
----

## Syncing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform groups with the LDAP server

You can sync all groups already in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform that correspond to groups in the
LDAP server specified in the configuration file.

* Create a sync configuration file.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

* To sync Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform groups with the LDAP server:

```terminal
$ oc adm groups sync --type=openshift --sync-config=config.yaml --confirm
```


[NOTE]
----
By default, all group synchronization operations are dry-run, so you
must set the --confirm flag on the oc adm groups sync command to make
changes to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform group records.
----

## Syncing subgroups from the LDAP server with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

You can sync a subset of LDAP groups with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform using whitelist files,
blacklist files, or both.


[NOTE]
----
You can use any combination of blacklist files, whitelist files, or whitelist
literals. Whitelist and blacklist files must contain one unique group identifier
per line, and you can include whitelist literals directly in the command itself.
These guidelines apply to groups found on LDAP servers as well as groups already
present in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
----

* Create a sync configuration file.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

* To sync a subset of LDAP groups with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, use any the following commands:

```terminal
$ oc adm groups sync --whitelist=<whitelist_file> \
                   --sync-config=config.yaml      \
                   --confirm
```


```terminal
$ oc adm groups sync --blacklist=<blacklist_file> \
                   --sync-config=config.yaml      \
                   --confirm
```


```terminal
$ oc adm groups sync <group_unique_identifier>    \
                   --sync-config=config.yaml      \
                   --confirm
```


```terminal
$ oc adm groups sync <group_unique_identifier>  \
                   --whitelist=<whitelist_file> \
                   --blacklist=<blacklist_file> \
                   --sync-config=config.yaml    \
                   --confirm
```


```terminal
$ oc adm groups sync --type=openshift           \
                   --whitelist=<whitelist_file> \
                   --sync-config=config.yaml    \
                   --confirm
```


[NOTE]
----
By default, all group synchronization operations are dry-run, so you
must set the --confirm flag on the oc adm groups sync command to make
changes to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform group records.
----

# Running a group pruning job

An administrator can also choose to remove groups from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform records
if the records on the LDAP server that created them are no longer present. The
prune job will accept the same sync configuration file and whitelists or blacklists
as used for the sync job.

For example:


```terminal
$ oc adm prune groups --sync-config=/path/to/ldap-sync-config.yaml --confirm
```



```terminal
$ oc adm prune groups --whitelist=/path/to/whitelist.txt --sync-config=/path/to/ldap-sync-config.yaml --confirm
```



```terminal
$ oc adm prune groups --blacklist=/path/to/blacklist.txt --sync-config=/path/to/ldap-sync-config.yaml --confirm
```


# Automatically syncing LDAP groups

You can automatically sync LDAP groups on a periodic basis by configuring a cron job.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You have configured an LDAP identity provider (IDP).

This procedure assumes that you created an LDAP secret named ldap-secret and a config map named ca-config-map.

1. Create a project where the cron job will run:

```terminal
$ oc new-project ldap-sync 1
```

This procedure uses a project called ldap-sync.
2. Locate the secret and config map that you created when configuring the LDAP identity provider and copy them to this new project.

The secret and config map exist in the openshift-config project and must be copied to the new ldap-sync project.
3. Define a service account:
Example ldap-sync-service-account.yaml

```yaml
kind: ServiceAccount
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: ldap-group-syncer
  namespace: ldap-sync
```

4. Create the service account:

```terminal
$ oc create -f ldap-sync-service-account.yaml
```

5. Define a cluster role:
Example ldap-sync-cluster-role.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: ldap-group-syncer
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - user.openshift.io
    resources:
      - groups
    verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - create
      - update
```

6. Create the cluster role:

```terminal
$ oc create -f ldap-sync-cluster-role.yaml
```

7. Define a cluster role binding to bind the cluster role to the service account:
Example ldap-sync-cluster-role-binding.yaml

```yaml
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: ldap-group-syncer
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: ldap-group-syncer              1
    namespace: ldap-sync
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: ldap-group-syncer                2
```

Reference to the service account created earlier in this procedure.
Reference to the cluster role created earlier in this procedure.
8. Create the cluster role binding:

```terminal
$ oc create -f ldap-sync-cluster-role-binding.yaml
```

9. Define a config map that specifies the sync configuration file:
Example ldap-sync-config-map.yaml

```yaml
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: ldap-group-syncer
  namespace: ldap-sync
data:
  sync.yaml: |                                 1
    kind: LDAPSyncConfig
    apiVersion: v1
    url: ldaps://10.0.0.0:636                  2
    insecure: false
    bindDN: cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com         3
    bindPassword:
      file: "/etc/secrets/bindPassword"
    ca: /etc/ldap-ca/ca.crt
    rfc2307:                                   4
      groupsQuery:
        baseDN: "ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com"  5
        scope: sub
        filter: "(objectClass=groupOfMembers)"
        derefAliases: never
        pageSize: 0
      groupUIDAttribute: dn
      groupNameAttributes: [ cn ]
      groupMembershipAttributes: [ member ]
      usersQuery:
        baseDN: "ou=users,dc=example,dc=com"   6
        scope: sub
        derefAliases: never
        pageSize: 0
      userUIDAttribute: dn
      userNameAttributes: [ uid ]
      tolerateMemberNotFoundErrors: false
      tolerateMemberOutOfScopeErrors: false
```

Define the sync configuration file.
Specify the URL.
Specify the bindDN.
This example uses the RFC2307 schema; adjust values as necessary. You can also use a different schema.
Specify the baseDN for groupsQuery.
Specify the baseDN for usersQuery.
10. Create the config map:

```terminal
$ oc create -f ldap-sync-config-map.yaml
```

11. Define a cron job:
Example ldap-sync-cron-job.yaml

```yaml
kind: CronJob
apiVersion: batch/v1
metadata:
  name: ldap-group-syncer
  namespace: ldap-sync
spec:                                                                                1
  schedule: "*/30 * * * *"                                                           2

                  name: "ldap-ca"
          volumes:
            - name: "ldap-sync-volume"
              configMap:
                name: "ldap-group-syncer"
            - name: "ldap-bind-password"
              secret:
                secretName: "ldap-secret"                                            5

# LDAP group sync examples

This section contains examples for the RFC 2307, Active Directory, and
augmented Active Directory schemas.


[NOTE]
----
These examples assume that all users are direct members of their respective
groups. Specifically, no groups have other groups as members. See
the Nested Membership Sync Example for information on
how to sync nested groups.
----

## Syncing groups using the RFC 2307 schema

For the RFC 2307 schema, the following examples synchronize a group named admins that has two
members: Jane and Jim. The examples explain:

* How the group and users are added to the LDAP server.
* What the resulting group record in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform will be after synchronization.


[NOTE]
----
These examples assume that all users are direct members of their respective
groups. Specifically, no groups have other groups as members. See
the Nested Membership Sync Example for information on
how to sync nested groups.
----

In the RFC 2307 schema, both users (Jane and Jim) and groups exist on the LDAP
server as first-class entries, and group membership is stored in attributes on
the group. The following snippet of ldif defines the users and group for this
schema:


```ldif
  dn: ou=users,dc=example,dc=com
  objectClass: organizationalUnit
  ou: users
  dn: cn=Jane,ou=users,dc=example,dc=com
  objectClass: person
  objectClass: organizationalPerson
  objectClass: inetOrgPerson
  cn: Jane
  sn: Smith
  displayName: Jane Smith
  mail: jane.smith@example.com
  dn: cn=Jim,ou=users,dc=example,dc=com
  objectClass: person
  objectClass: organizationalPerson
  objectClass: inetOrgPerson
  cn: Jim
  sn: Adams
  displayName: Jim Adams
  mail: jim.adams@example.com
  dn: ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com
  objectClass: organizationalUnit
  ou: groups
  dn: cn=admins,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com 1
  objectClass: groupOfNames
  cn: admins
  owner: cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com
  description: System Administrators
  member: cn=Jane,ou=users,dc=example,dc=com 2
  member: cn=Jim,ou=users,dc=example,dc=com
```


The group is a first-class entry in the LDAP server.
Members of a group are listed with an identifying reference as attributes on
the group.

* Create the configuration file.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

* Run the sync with the rfc2307_config.yaml file:

```terminal
$ oc adm groups sync --sync-config=rfc2307_config.yaml --confirm
```


Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform creates the following group record as a result of the above sync
operation:
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform group created by using the rfc2307_config.yaml file

```yaml
apiVersion: user.openshift.io/v1
kind: Group
metadata:
  annotations:
    openshift.io/ldap.sync-time: 2015-10-13T10:08:38-0400 1
    openshift.io/ldap.uid: cn=admins,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com 2
    openshift.io/ldap.url: LDAP_SERVER_IP:389 3
  creationTimestamp:
  name: admins 4
users: 5
- jane.smith@example.com
- jim.adams@example.com
```

The last time this Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform group was synchronized with the LDAP server, in ISO 6801
format.
The unique identifier for the group on the LDAP server.
The IP address and host of the LDAP server where this group's record is
stored.
The name of the group as specified by the sync file.
The users that are members of the group, named as specified by the sync file.

## Syncing groups using the RFC2307 schema with user-defined name mappings

When syncing groups with user-defined name mappings, the configuration file
changes to contain these mappings as shown below.


```yaml
kind: LDAPSyncConfig
apiVersion: v1
groupUIDNameMapping:
  "cn=admins,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com": Administrators 1
rfc2307:
    groupsQuery:
        baseDN: "ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com"
        scope: sub
        derefAliases: never
        pageSize: 0
    groupUIDAttribute: dn 2
    groupNameAttributes: [ cn ] 3
    groupMembershipAttributes: [ member ]
    usersQuery:
        baseDN: "ou=users,dc=example,dc=com"
        scope: sub
        derefAliases: never
        pageSize: 0
    userUIDAttribute: dn 4
    userNameAttributes: [ mail ]
    tolerateMemberNotFoundErrors: false
    tolerateMemberOutOfScopeErrors: false
```


The user-defined name mapping.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform creates the following group record as a result of the above sync
operation:

The name of the group as specified by the user-defined name mapping.

## Syncing groups using RFC 2307 with user-defined error tolerances

By default, if the groups being synced contain members whose entries are outside
of the scope defined in the member query, the group sync fails with an error:


```
Error determining LDAP group membership for "<group>": membership lookup for user "<user>" in group "<group>" failed because of "search for entry with dn="<user-dn>" would search outside of the base dn specified (dn="<base-dn>")".
```


This often indicates a misconfigured baseDN in the usersQuery field.
However, in cases where the baseDN intentionally does not contain some of the
members of the group, setting tolerateMemberOutOfScopeErrors: true allows
the group sync to continue. Out of scope members will be ignored.

Similarly, when the group sync process fails to locate a member for a group, it
fails outright with errors:


```
Error determining LDAP group membership for "<group>": membership lookup for user "<user>" in group "<group>" failed because of "search for entry with base dn="<user-dn>" refers to a non-existent entry".
Error determining LDAP group membership for "<group>": membership lookup for user "<user>" in group "<group>" failed because of "search for entry with base dn="<user-dn>" and filter "<filter>" did not return any results".
```


This often indicates a misconfigured usersQuery field. However, in cases
where the group contains member entries that are known to be missing, setting
tolerateMemberNotFoundErrors: true allows the group sync to continue.
Problematic members will be ignored.


[WARNING]
----
Enabling error tolerances for the LDAP group sync causes the sync process to
ignore problematic member entries. If the LDAP group sync is not configured
correctly, this could result in synced Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform groups missing members.

A member that does not exist on the LDAP server.
A member that may exist, but is not under the baseDN in the

To tolerate the errors in the above example, the following additions to
your sync configuration file must be made:


```yaml
kind: LDAPSyncConfig
apiVersion: v1
url: ldap://LDAP_SERVICE_IP:389
rfc2307:
    groupsQuery:
        baseDN: "ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com"
        scope: sub
        derefAliases: never
    groupUIDAttribute: dn
    groupNameAttributes: [ cn ]
    groupMembershipAttributes: [ member ]
    usersQuery:
        baseDN: "ou=users,dc=example,dc=com"
        scope: sub
        derefAliases: never
    userUIDAttribute: dn 1
    userNameAttributes: [ mail ]
    tolerateMemberNotFoundErrors: true 2
    tolerateMemberOutOfScopeErrors: true 3
```


The attribute that uniquely identifies a user on the LDAP server. You
cannot specify usersQuery filters when using DN for userUIDAttribute. For
fine-grained  filtering, use the whitelist / blacklist method.
When true, the sync job tolerates groups for which some members were not
found, and members whose LDAP entries are not found are ignored. The
default behavior for the sync job is to fail if a member of a group is not
found.
When true, the sync job tolerates groups for which some members are outside
the user scope given in the usersQuery base DN, and members outside the member
query scope are ignored. The default behavior for the sync job is to fail if a
member of a group is out of scope.

* Create the configuration file.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

* Run the sync with the rfc2307_config_tolerating.yaml file:

```terminal
$ oc adm groups sync --sync-config=rfc2307_config_tolerating.yaml --confirm
```


Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform creates the following group record as a result of the above sync

## Syncing groups using the Active Directory schema

In the Active Directory schema, both users (Jane and Jim) exist in the LDAP
server as first-class entries, and group membership is stored in attributes on
the user. The following snippet of ldif defines the users and group for this
schema:


```ldif
dn: ou=users,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: organizationalUnit
ou: users

dn: cn=Jane,ou=users,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: person
objectClass: organizationalPerson
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
objectClass: testPerson
cn: Jane
sn: Smith
displayName: Jane Smith
mail: jane.smith@example.com
memberOf: admins 1

dn: cn=Jim,ou=users,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: person
objectClass: organizationalPerson
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
objectClass: testPerson
cn: Jim
sn: Adams
displayName: Jim Adams
mail: jim.adams@example.com
memberOf: admins
```


The user's group memberships are listed as attributes on the user, and the
group does not exist as an entry on the server. The memberOf attribute does
not have to be a literal attribute on the user; in some LDAP servers, it is created
during search and returned to the client, but not committed to the database.

* Create the configuration file.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

* Run the sync with the active_directory_config.yaml file:

```terminal
$ oc adm groups sync --sync-config=active_directory_config.yaml --confirm
```


Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform creates the following group record as a result of the above sync
operation:

## Syncing groups using the augmented Active Directory schema

In the augmented Active Directory schema, both users (Jane and Jim) and groups
exist in the LDAP server as first-class entries, and group membership is stored
in attributes on the user. The following snippet of ldif defines the users and
group for this schema:


```ldif

### LDAP nested membership sync example

Groups in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform do not nest. The LDAP server must flatten group
membership before the data can be consumed. Microsoft&#8217;s Active Directory Server supports this feature via the LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN rule, which has the OID 1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941. Furthermore, only explicitly
whitelisted groups can be synced when using this matching rule.

This section has an example for the augmented Active Directory schema, which
synchronizes a group named admins that has one user Jane and one group
otheradmins as members. The otheradmins group has one user member: Jim.
This example explains:

* How the group and users are added to the LDAP server.
* What the LDAP sync configuration file looks like.
* What the resulting group record in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform will be after synchronization.

In the augmented Active Directory schema, both users (Jane and Jim) and
groups exist in the LDAP server as first-class entries, and group membership is
stored in attributes on the user or the group. The following snippet of ldif
defines the users and groups for this schema:


```ldif
dn: ou=users,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: organizationalUnit
ou: users

dn: cn=Jane,ou=users,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: person
objectClass: organizationalPerson
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
objectClass: testPerson
cn: Jane
sn: Smith
displayName: Jane Smith
mail: jane.smith@example.com
memberOf: cn=admins,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com 1

dn: cn=Jim,ou=users,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: person
objectClass: organizationalPerson
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
objectClass: testPerson
cn: Jim
sn: Adams
displayName: Jim Adams
mail: jim.adams@example.com
memberOf: cn=otheradmins,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com 1

dn: ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: organizationalUnit
ou: groups

dn: cn=admins,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com 2
objectClass: group
cn: admins
owner: cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com
description: System Administrators
member: cn=Jane,ou=users,dc=example,dc=com
member: cn=otheradmins,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com

dn: cn=otheradmins,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com 2
objectClass: group
cn: otheradmins
owner: cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com
description: Other System Administrators
memberOf: cn=admins,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com 1 3
member: cn=Jim,ou=users,dc=example,dc=com
```


The user's and group's memberships are listed as attributes on the object.
The groups are first-class entries on the LDAP server.
The otheradmins group is a member of the admins group.

When syncing nested groups with Active Directory, you must provide an LDAP query
definition for both user entries and group entries, as well as the attributes
with which to represent them in the internal Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform group records.
Furthermore, certain changes are required in this configuration:

* The oc adm groups sync command must explicitly whitelist groups.
* The user's groupMembershipAttributes must include "memberOf:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:" to comply with the LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN rule.
* The groupUIDAttribute must be set to dn.
* The groupsQuery:
* Must not set filter.
* Must set a valid derefAliases.
* Should not set baseDN as that value is ignored.
* Should not set scope as that value is ignored.

For clarity, the group you create in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform should use attributes other
than the distinguished name whenever possible for user- or administrator-facing
fields. For example, identify the users of an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform group by their e-mail, and use the
name of the group as the common name. The following configuration file creates
these relationships:


```yaml
kind: LDAPSyncConfig
apiVersion: v1
url: ldap://LDAP_SERVICE_IP:389
augmentedActiveDirectory:
    groupsQuery: 1
        derefAliases: never
        pageSize: 0
    groupUIDAttribute: dn 2
    groupNameAttributes: [ cn ] 3
    usersQuery:
        baseDN: "ou=users,dc=example,dc=com"
        scope: sub
        derefAliases: never
        filter: (objectclass=person)
        pageSize: 0
    userNameAttributes: [ mail ] 4
    groupMembershipAttributes: [ "memberOf:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:" ] 5
```


groupsQuery filters cannot be specified. The groupsQuery base DN and scope
values are ignored. groupsQuery must set a valid derefAliases.
The attribute that uniquely identifies a group on the LDAP server. It must be set to dn.
The attribute to use as the name of the group.
The attribute to use as the name of the user in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform group
record. mail or sAMAccountName are preferred choices in most installations.
The attribute on the user that stores the membership information. Note the use of LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN.

* Create the configuration file.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

* Run the sync with the augmented_active_directory_config_nested.yaml file:

```terminal
$ oc adm groups sync \
    'cn=admins,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com' \
    --sync-config=augmented_active_directory_config_nested.yaml \
    --confirm
```


[NOTE]
----
You must explicitly whitelist the cn=admins,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com group.

# LDAP sync configuration specification

The object specification for the configuration file is below.  Note that the different schema
objects have different fields.  For example, v1.ActiveDirectoryConfig has no groupsQuery
field whereas v1.RFC2307Config and v1.AugmentedActiveDirectoryConfig both do.


[IMPORTANT]
----
There is no support for binary attributes. All attribute data coming from the
LDAP server must be in the format of a UTF-8 encoded string. For example, never
use a binary attribute, such as objectGUID, as an ID attribute. You must use
string attributes, such as sAMAccountName or userPrincipalName, instead.

variable or file. When it contains only a string value, it marshals to a simple
JSON string.



## v1.LDAPQuery

LDAPQuery holds the options necessary to build an LDAP query.



## v1.RFC2307Config

RFC2307Config holds the necessary configuration options to define how an LDAP
group sync interacts with an LDAP server using the RFC2307 schema.



## v1.ActiveDirectoryConfig

ActiveDirectoryConfig holds the necessary configuration options to define how
an LDAP group sync interacts with an LDAP server using the Active Directory
schema.
