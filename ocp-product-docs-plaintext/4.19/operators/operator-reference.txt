# Cluster Operators reference


This reference guide indexes the cluster Operators shipped by Red Hat that serve as the architectural foundation for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. Cluster Operators are installed by default, unless otherwise noted, and are managed by the Cluster Version Operator (CVO). For more details on the control plane architecture, see Operators in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
Cluster administrators can view cluster Operators in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console from the Administration -> Cluster Settings page.

[NOTE]
----
Cluster Operators are not managed by Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) and OperatorHub. OLM and OperatorHub are part of the Operator Framework used in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform for installing and running optional add-on Operators.
----
Some of the following cluster Operators can be disabled prior to installation. For more information see cluster capabilities.

# Cluster Baremetal Operator


[NOTE]
----
The Cluster Baremetal Operator is an optional cluster capability that can be disabled by cluster administrators during installation. For more information about optional cluster capabilities, see "Cluster capabilities" in Installing.
----

## Purpose

The Cluster Baremetal Operator (CBO) deploys all the components necessary to take a bare-metal server to a fully functioning worker node ready to run Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform compute nodes. The CBO ensures that the metal3 deployment, which consists of the Bare Metal Operator (BMO) and Ironic containers, runs on one of the control plane nodes within the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. The CBO also listens for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform updates to resources that it watches and takes appropriate action.

# Cloud Credential Operator

## Purpose

The Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) manages cloud provider credentials as Kubernetes custom resource definitions (CRDs). The CCO syncs on CredentialsRequest custom resources (CRs) to allow Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform components to request cloud provider credentials with the specific permissions that are required for the cluster to run.

By setting different values for the credentialsMode parameter in the install-config.yaml file, the CCO can be configured to operate in several different modes. If no mode is specified, or the credentialsMode parameter is set to an empty string (""), the CCO operates in its default mode.

# Cluster Image Registry Operator

## Purpose

The Cluster Image Registry Operator manages a singleton instance of the OpenShift image registry. It manages all configuration of the registry, including creating storage.

On initial start up, the Operator creates a default image-registry resource instance based on the configuration detected in the cluster. This indicates what cloud storage type to use based on the cloud provider.

If insufficient information is available to define a complete image-registry resource, then an incomplete resource is defined and the Operator updates the resource status with information about what is missing.

The Cluster Image Registry Operator runs in the openshift-image-registry namespace and it also manages the registry instance in that location. All configuration and workload resources for the registry reside in that namespace.

## Project

cluster-image-registry-operator

# Cluster Machine Approver Operator

## Purpose

The Cluster Machine Approver Operator automatically approves the CSRs requested for a new worker node after cluster installation.


[NOTE]

# Cluster Network Operator

## Purpose

The Cluster Network Operator installs and upgrades the networking components on an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

# Cluster Samples Operator


[NOTE]
----
The Cluster Samples Operator is an optional cluster capability that can be disabled by cluster administrators during installation. For more information about optional cluster capabilities, see "Cluster capabilities" in Installing.
----

## Purpose

The Cluster Samples Operator manages the sample image streams and templates stored in the openshift namespace.

On initial start up, the Operator creates the default samples configuration resource to initiate the creation of the image streams and templates. The configuration object is a cluster scoped object with the key cluster and type configs.samples.

The image streams are the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS)-based Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform image streams pointing to images on registry.redhat.io. Similarly, the templates are those categorized as Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform templates.

The Cluster Samples Operator deployment is contained within the openshift-cluster-samples-operator namespace. On start up, the install pull secret is used by the image stream import logic in the OpenShift image registry and API server to authenticate with registry.redhat.io. An administrator can create any additional secrets in the openshift namespace if they change the registry used for the sample image streams. If created, those secrets contain the content of a config.json for docker needed to facilitate image import.

The image for the Cluster Samples Operator contains image stream and template definitions for the associated Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release. After the Cluster Samples Operator creates a sample, it adds an annotation that denotes the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version that it is compatible with. The Operator uses this annotation to ensure that each sample matches the compatible release version. Samples outside of its inventory are ignored, as are skipped samples.

Modifications to any samples that are managed by the Operator are allowed as long as the version annotation is not modified or deleted. However, on an upgrade, as the version annotation will change, those modifications can get replaced as the sample will be updated with the newer version. The Jenkins images are part of the image payload from the installation and are tagged into the image streams directly.

The samples resource includes a finalizer, which cleans up the following upon its deletion:

* Operator-managed image streams
* Operator-managed templates
* Operator-generated configuration resources
* Cluster status resources

Upon deletion of the samples resource, the Cluster Samples Operator recreates the resource using the default configuration.

## Project

* OpenShift samples capability

# Cluster Storage Operator


[NOTE]
----
The Cluster Storage Operator is an optional cluster capability that can be disabled by cluster administrators during installation. For more information about optional cluster capabilities, see "Cluster capabilities" in Installing.
----

## Purpose

The Cluster Storage Operator sets Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster-wide storage defaults. It ensures a default storageclass exists for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters. It also installs Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers which enable your cluster to use various storage backends.

## Project

cluster-storage-operator

## Configuration

No configuration is required.

## Notes

* The storage class that the Operator creates can be made non-default by editing its annotation, but this storage class cannot be deleted as long as the Operator runs.

* Storage capability

# Cluster Version Operator

## Purpose

Cluster Operators manage specific areas of cluster functionality. The Cluster Version Operator (CVO) manages the lifecycle of cluster Operators, many of which are installed in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform by default.

The CVO also checks with the OpenShift Update Service to see the valid updates and update paths based on current component versions and information in the graph by collecting the status of both the cluster version and its cluster Operators. This status includes the condition type, which informs you of the health and current state of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

For more information regarding cluster version condition types, see "Understanding cluster version condition types".

# Ingress Operator

## Purpose

The Ingress Operator configures and manages the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform router.

## Project

openshift-ingress-operator

## CRDs

* clusteringresses.ingress.openshift.io
* Scope: Namespaced
* CR: clusteringresses
* Validation: No

## Configuration objects

* Cluster config
* Type Name: clusteringresses.ingress.openshift.io
* Instance Name: default
* View Command:

```terminal
$ oc get clusteringresses.ingress.openshift.io -n openshift-ingress-operator default -o yaml
```


## Notes

The Ingress Operator sets up the router in the openshift-ingress project and creates the deployment for the router:


```terminal
$ oc get deployment -n openshift-ingress
```


The Ingress Operator uses the clusterNetwork[].cidr from the network/cluster status to determine what mode (IPv4, IPv6, or dual stack) the managed Ingress Controller (router) should operate in. For example, if clusterNetwork contains only a v6 cidr, then the Ingress Controller operates in IPv6-only mode.

In the following example, Ingress Controllers managed by the Ingress Operator will run in IPv4-only mode because only one cluster network exists and the network is an IPv4 cidr:


```terminal
$ oc get network/cluster -o jsonpath='{.status.clusterNetwork[*]}'
```



```terminal
map[cidr:10.128.0.0/14 hostPrefix:23]
```

# Machine API Operator

## Purpose

The Machine API Operator manages the lifecycle of specific purpose custom resource definitions (CRD), controllers, and RBAC objects that extend the Kubernetes API. This declares the desired state of machines in a cluster.

## Project

machine-api-operator

## CRDs

* MachineSet
* Machine
* MachineHealthCheck

# Machine Config Operator

## Purpose

The Machine Config Operator manages and applies configuration and updates of the base operating system and container runtime, including everything between the kernel and kubelet.

There are four components:

* machine-config-server: Provides Ignition configuration to new machines joining the cluster.
* machine-config-controller: Coordinates the upgrade of machines to the desired configurations defined by a MachineConfig object. Options are provided to control the upgrade for sets of machines individually.
* machine-config-daemon: Applies new machine configuration during update. Validates and verifies the state of the machine to the requested machine configuration.
* machine-config: Provides a complete source of machine configuration at installation, first start up, and updates for a machine.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Currently, there is no supported way to block or restrict the machine config server endpoint. The machine config server must be exposed to the network so that newly-provisioned machines, which have no existing configuration or state, are able to fetch their configuration. In this model, the root of trust is the certificate signing requests (CSR) endpoint, which is where the kubelet sends its certificate signing request for approval to join the cluster. Because of this, machine configs should not be used to distribute sensitive information, such as secrets and certificates.
To ensure that the machine config server endpoints, ports 22623 and 22624, are secured in bare metal scenarios, customers must configure proper network policies.

# Marketplace Operator


[NOTE]
----
The Marketplace Operator is an optional cluster capability that can be disabled by cluster administrators if it is not needed. For more information about optional cluster capabilities, see "Cluster capabilities" in Installing.
----

## Purpose

The Marketplace Operator simplifies the process for bringing off-cluster Operators to your cluster by using a set of default Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) catalogs on the cluster. When the Marketplace Operator is installed, it creates the openshift-marketplace namespace. OLM ensures catalog sources installed in the openshift-marketplace namespace are available for all namespaces on the cluster.

# Node Tuning Operator

## Purpose

The Node Tuning Operator helps you manage node-level tuning by orchestrating the TuneD daemon and achieves low latency performance by using the Performance Profile controller. The majority of high-performance applications require some level of kernel tuning. The Node Tuning Operator provides a unified management interface to users of node-level sysctls and more flexibility to add custom tuning specified by user needs.

The Operator manages the containerized TuneD daemon for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform as a Kubernetes daemon set. It ensures the custom tuning specification is passed to all containerized TuneD daemons running in the cluster in the format that the daemons understand. The daemons run on all nodes in the cluster, one per node.

Node-level settings applied by the containerized TuneD daemon are rolled back on an event that triggers a profile change or when the containerized TuneD daemon is terminated gracefully by receiving and handling a termination signal.

The Node Tuning Operator uses the Performance Profile controller to implement automatic tuning to achieve low latency performance for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform applications.

The cluster administrator configures a performance profile to define node-level settings such as the following:

* Updating the kernel to kernel-rt.
* Choosing CPUs for housekeeping.
* Choosing CPUs for running workloads.

The Node Tuning Operator is part of a standard Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation in version 4.1 and later.


[NOTE]
----
In earlier versions of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, the Performance Addon Operator was used to implement automatic tuning to achieve low latency performance for OpenShift applications. In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.11 and later, this functionality is part of the Node Tuning Operator.

# Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) Classic Operators


[NOTE]
----
The following sections pertain to Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) Classic that has been included with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 since its initial release. For OLM v1, see Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) v1 Operators.
----

## Purpose

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) Classic helps users install, update, and manage the lifecycle of Kubernetes native applications (Operators) and their associated services running across their Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters. It is part of the Operator Framework, an open source toolkit designed to manage Operators in an effective, automated, and scalable way.

![olm workflow]

OLM runs by default in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19, which aids
cluster administrators
in installing, upgrading, and granting access to Operators running on their cluster. The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console provides management screens for
cluster administrators
to install Operators, as well as grant specific projects access to use the catalog of Operators available on the cluster.

For developers, a self-service experience allows provisioning and configuring instances of databases, monitoring, and big data services without having to be subject matter experts, because the Operator has that knowledge baked into it.

## OLM Operator

The OLM Operator is responsible for deploying applications defined by CSV resources after the required resources specified in the CSV are present in the cluster.

The OLM Operator is not concerned with the creation of the required resources; you can choose to manually create these resources using the CLI or using the Catalog Operator. This separation of concern allows users incremental buy-in in terms of how much of the OLM framework they choose to leverage for their application.

The OLM Operator uses the following workflow:

1. Watch for cluster service versions (CSVs) in a namespace and check that requirements are met.
2. If requirements are met, run the install strategy for the CSV.

[NOTE]
----
A CSV must be an active member of an Operator group for the install strategy to run.
----

## Catalog Operator

The Catalog Operator is responsible for resolving and installing cluster service versions (CSVs) and the required resources they specify. It is also responsible for watching catalog sources for updates to packages in channels and upgrading them, automatically if desired, to the latest available versions.

To track a package in a channel, you can create a Subscription object configuring the desired package, channel, and the CatalogSource object you want to use for pulling updates. When updates are found, an appropriate InstallPlan object is written into the namespace on behalf of the user.

The Catalog Operator uses the following workflow:

1. Connect to each catalog source in the cluster.
2. Watch for unresolved install plans created by a user, and if found:
1. Find the CSV matching the name requested and add the CSV as a resolved resource.
2. For each managed or required CRD, add the CRD as a resolved resource.
3. For each required CRD, find the CSV that manages it.
3. Watch for resolved install plans and create all of the discovered resources for it, if approved by a user or automatically.
4. Watch for catalog sources and subscriptions and create install plans based on them.

## Catalog Registry

The Catalog Registry stores CSVs and CRDs for creation in a cluster and stores metadata about packages and channels.

A package manifest is an entry in the Catalog Registry that associates a package identity with sets of CSVs. Within a package, channels point to a particular CSV. Because CSVs explicitly reference the CSV that they replace, a package manifest provides the Catalog Operator with all of the information that is required to update a CSV to the latest version in a channel, stepping through each intermediate version.

## CRDs

The OLM and Catalog Operators are responsible for managing the custom resource definitions (CRDs) that are the basis for the OLM framework:



Each of these Operators is also responsible for creating the following resources:



## Cluster Operators

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, OLM functionality is provided across a set of cluster Operators:

operator-lifecycle-manager:: Provides the OLM Operator. Also informs cluster administrators if there are any installed Operators blocking cluster upgrade, based on their olm.maxOpenShiftVersion properties. For more information, see "Controlling Operator compatibility with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform versions".
operator-lifecycle-manager-catalog:: Provides the Catalog Operator.
operator-lifecycle-manager-packageserver:: Represents an API extension server responsible for collecting metadata from all catalogs on the cluster and serves the user-facing PackageManifest API.

## Additional resources

* Understanding Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)

# Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) v1 Operator

## Purpose

Starting in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18, OLM v1 is enabled by default alongside OLM (Classic). This next-generation iteration provides an updated framework that evolves many of OLM (Classic) concepts that enable cluster administrators to extend capabilities for their users.

OLM v1 manages the lifecycle of the new ClusterExtension object, which includes Operators via the registry+v1 bundle format, and controls installation, upgrade, and role-based access control (RBAC) of extensions within a cluster.

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, OLM v1 is provided by the olm cluster Operator.


[NOTE]
----
The olm cluster Operator informs cluster administrators if there are any installed extensions blocking cluster upgrade, based on their olm.maxOpenShiftVersion properties. For more information, see "Compatibility with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform versions".
----

## Components

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) v1 comprises the following component projects:

Operator Controller:: The central component of OLM v1 that extends Kubernetes with an API through which users can install and manage the lifecycle of Operators and extensions. It consumes information from catalogd.
Catalogd:: A Kubernetes extension that unpacks file-based catalog (FBC) content packaged and shipped in container images for consumption by on-cluster clients. As a component of the OLM v1 microservices architecture, catalogd hosts metadata for Kubernetes extensions packaged by the authors of the extensions, and as a result helps users discover installable content.
