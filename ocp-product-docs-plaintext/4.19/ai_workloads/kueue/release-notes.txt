## New features and enhancements

Configure a default local queue:: A default local queue serves as the local queue for newly created jobs that do not have the kueue.x-k8s.io/queue-name label. After you create a default local queue, any new jobs created in the namespace without a kueue.x-k8s.io/queue-name label automatically update to have the kueue.x-k8s.io/queue-name: default label.

(RFE-7615)
Multi-architecture and Hosted control planes support:: With this release, Red Hat build of Kueue is supported on multiple different architectures, including ARM64, 64-bit x86, ppc64le (IBM Power(R)), and s390x (IBM Z(R)), as well as on Hosted control planes for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

## Fixed issues

You can create a Kueue custom resource by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console:: Before this update, if you tried to use the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console to create a Kueue custom resource (CR) by using the form view, the web console showed an error and the resource could not be created. With this release, the default namespace was removed from the Kueue CR template. As a result, you can use the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console to create a Kueue CR by using the form view.

(OCPBUGS-58118)

## Known issues

Kueue CR description reads as "Not available" in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console:: After you install Red Hat build of Kueue, in the Operator details view, the description for the Kueue CR reads as "Not available". This issue does not affect or degrade the Red Hat build of Kueue Operator functionality.

(OCPBUGS-62185)
Custom resources are not deleted properly when you uninstall Red Hat build of Kueue:: After you uninstall the Red Hat Build of Kueue Operator using the Delete all operand instances for this operator option in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, some Red Hat build of Kueue custom resources are not fully deleted. These resources can be viewed in the Installed Operators view with the status Resource is being deleted. As a workaround, you can manually delete the resource finalizers to remove them fully.

# Release notes for Red Hat build of Kueue version 1.0.1

Red&#160;Hat build of Kueue version 1.0.1 is a patch release that is supported on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform versions 4.18 and 4.19 on the 64-bit x86 architecture.

Red&#160;Hat build of Kueue version 1.0.1 uses Kueue version 0.11.

## Bug fixes in Red Hat build of Kueue version 1.0.1

* Previously, leader election for Red Hat build of Kueue was not configured to tolerate disruption, which resulted in frequent crashing. With this release, the leader election values for Red Hat build of Kueue have been updated to match the durations recommended for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. (OCPBUGS-58496)
* Previously, the ReadyReplicas count was not set in the reconciler, which meant that the Red Hat build of Kueue Operator status would report that there were no replicas ready. With this release, the ReadyReplicas count is based on the number of ready replicas for the deployment, which ensures that the Operator shows as ready in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform console when the kueue-controller-manager pods are ready. (OCPBUGS-59261)
* Previously, when the Kueue custom resource (CR) was deleted from the openshift-kueue-operator namespace, the kueue-manager-config config map was not deleted automatically and could remain in the namespace. With this release, the kueue-manager-config config map, kueue-webhook-server-cert secret, and metrics-server-cert secret are deleted automatically when the Kueue CR is deleted. (OCPBUGS-57960)

# Release notes for Red Hat build of Kueue version 1.0

Red&#160;Hat build of Kueue version 1.0 is a generally available release that is supported on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform versions 4.18 and 4.19 on the 64-bit x86 architecture. Red&#160;Hat build of Kueue version 1.0 uses Kueue version 0.11.

## New features and enhancements

Role-based access control (RBAC):: Role-based access control (RBAC) enables you to control which types of users can create which types of Red Hat build of Kueue resources.
Configure resource quotas:: Configuring resource quotas by creating cluster queues, resource flavors, and local queues enables you to control the amount of resources used by user-submitted jobs and workloads.
Control job and workload management:: Labeling namespaces and configuring label policies enable you to control which jobs and workloads are managed by Red Hat build of Kueue.
Share borrowable resources between queues:: Configuring cohorts, fair sharing, and gang scheduling settings enable you to share unused, borrowable resources between queues.

## Known issues

Jobs in all namespaces are reconciled if they have the kueue.x-k8s.io/queue-name label:: Red Hat build of Kueue uses the managedJobsNamespaceSelector configuration field, so that administrators can configure which namespaces opt in to be managed by Red Hat build of Kueue. Because namespaces must be manually configured to opt in to being managed by Red Hat build of Kueue, resources in system or third-party namespaces are not impacted or managed by Red Hat build of Kueue.

The behavior in Red&#160;Hat build of Kueue 1.0 allows reconciliation of Job resources that have the kueue.x-k8s.io/queue-name label, even if these resources are in namespaces that are not configured to opt in to being managed by Red&#160;Hat build of Kueue. This is inconsistent with the behavior for other core integrations like pods, deployments, and stateful sets, which are only reconciled if they are in namespaces that have been configured to opt in to being managed by Red&#160;Hat build of Kueue.

(OCPBUGS-58205)
You cannot create a Kueue custom resource by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console:: If you try to use the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console to create a Kueue custom resource (CR) by using the form view, the web console shows an error and the resource cannot be created. As a workaround, use the YAML view to create a Kueue CR instead.
