# Red Hat OpenShift support for Windows Containers release notes


This release of the WMCO provides bug fixes for running Windows compute nodes in an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

# Release notes for Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator 10-19.0

The components of the WMCO 10-19.0 were released in RHSA-2025:14048.

## New features and improvements

### WMCO kubelet configuration changes

With this release, the WMCO now sets the following values in the KubeletConfig custom resource (CR):

* The system-reserved parameter on new Windows nodes is now set to 2GiB of memory for system processes by default, as recommended in the Kubernetes documentation. (WINC-1373)
* The enforceNodeAllocatable on new Windows nodes is now set to none by default. Previously, the value was set to [] to avoid a known issue. Both settings disable the enforcement of node allocatable resource limits. (WINC-926)
* The evictionHard parameters, imagefs.available and nodefs.available, are now set to 15% and 10% respectively by default, as recommended in the Kubernetes documentation. (WINC-1374)

The KubeletConfig object configures the kubelet service, which runs on each node in the cluster to ensure that containers in a pod are running.

### WMCO kubelet configuration changes

For disconnected clusters, the Windows AMI that you are using must have the EC2LaunchV2 agent version 2.0.2107 or later installed. Previously, the minimum required EC2LaunchV2 agent version was 2.0.1643. For more information, see the Install the latest version of EC2Launch v2 in the AWS documentation.

## Bug fixes

* Previously, when using the optional_namespaces parameter in an ImageTagMirrorSet CR, Windows nodes could fail to pull the specified image, resulting in a image not found error. With this fix, the optional_namespace parameter works as expected. (OCPBUGS-47696)
* Previously, Windows Server 2019 nodes did not have a running an SSH server because of network instability. As a result, you were unable to SSH into that node. With this fix, the WMCO installs the SSH server node creation. As a result, you can SSH into the Windows nodes as expected. (OCPBUGS-56131)
* Previously, because an Endpoint_IP variable was not resolving, the Windows Instance Config Daemon (WICD) repeatedly reported an Endpoint_IP error. This fix adds retries to ensure that the Endpoint_IP is created before continuing. As a result, the error message is no longer reported. (OCPBUGS-1721)

## Known issues

* Some Windows 2019 Bring-Your-Own-Host (BYOH) Window instances could enter a non-ready state after upgrading to 4.19. Red Hat has not been able to reproduce the issue outside the testing environment, and advises caution when upgrading. If you experience this situation, restart the non-ready instance. (OCPBUGS-47696)
