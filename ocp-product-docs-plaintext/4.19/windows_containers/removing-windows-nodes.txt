# Removing Windows nodes


You can remove a Windows node by deleting its host Windows machine.

# Deleting a specific machine

You can delete a specific machine.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not delete a control plane machine unless your cluster uses a control plane machine set.
----

* Install an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* Log in to oc as a user with cluster-admin permission.

1. View the machines that are in the cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get machine -n openshift-machine-api
```


The command output contains a list of machines in the <clusterid>-<role>-<cloud_region> format.
2. Identify the machine that you want to delete.
3. Delete the machine by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete machine <machine> -n openshift-machine-api
```


[IMPORTANT]
----
By default, the machine controller tries to drain the node that is backed by the machine until it succeeds. In some situations, such as with a misconfigured pod disruption budget, the drain operation might not be able to succeed. If the drain operation fails, the machine controller cannot proceed removing the machine.
You can skip draining the node by annotating machine.openshift.io/exclude-node-draining in a specific machine.
----

If the machine that you delete belongs to a machine set, a new machine is immediately created to satisfy the specified number of replicas.
