# cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift 1.16.1

Issued: 2025-07-10

The following advisories are available for the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift 1.16.1:

* RHBA-2025:10765
* RHBA-2025:10766
* RHBA-2025:10785

Version 1.16.1 of the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift is based on the upstream cert-manager version v1.16.5. For more information, see the cert-manager project release notes for v1.16.5.

## Bug fixes

Previously, cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift failed to create the cert-manager-tokenrequest role due to insufficient RBAC permissions. This resulted in RoleCreateFailed errors and a degraded static-resource controller. With this release, the issue is resolved by adding the necessary serviceaccounts/token create permission to the  RBAC configuration. As a result, the cert-manager-tokenrequest role and role binding are now successfully created, and RoleCreateFailed errors no longer appear in the operator logs. (OCPBUGS-56758)

## New features and enhancements

Disconnected environment support

With this release, the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift has been verified to be mirrored to and installed in a disconnected environment.

The Operator has also been validated to work with the following issuer types in disconnected environments: ACME, CA, Self-signed, and Vault.
Specifically, private or self-hosted ACME servers have been validated, as Let&#8217;s Encrypt or other public ACME services are not feasible options in disconnected environments.
The oc-mirror plugin v2 is the preferred method to mirror Operator images.
For more information, see Mirroring images for a disconnected installation by using the oc-mirror plugin v2.

Extended operand metrics support

With this release, cert-manager webhook and cainjector operands now expose Prometheus metrics on port 9402 by default via the /metrics service endpoint.
You can configure OpenShift Monitoring to collect metrics from all cert-manager operands by enabling the built-in user workload monitoring stack.
For more information, see Monitoring cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift.

Streaming Lists enablement

With this release, the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift now uses the new upstream WatchListClient feature.
This enables use of the Streaming Lists feature of the Kubernetes API server, which reduces the load on the API server.
The peak memory use of the cert-manager components when they start up is optimized on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14 and later.

Scheduling overrides for cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift

With this release, you can configure scheduling overrides for cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift, including the cert-manager controller, webhook, and CA injector.

Google CAS issuer

The cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift now supports the Google Certificate Authority Service (CAS) issuer. The google-cas-issuer is an external issuer for cert-manager that automates certificate lifecycle management, including issuance and renewal, with CAS-managed private certificate authorities.


[NOTE]
----
The Google CAS issuer is validated only with version 0.9.0 and cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift version 1.15.0. These versions support tasks such as issuing, renewing, and managing certificates for the API server and ingress controller in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters.
----

Default installMode updated to AllNamespaces

Starting from version 1.15.0, the default and recommended Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) installMode is AllNamespaces. Previously, the default was SingleNamespace. This change aligns with best practices for multi-namespace Operator management.
For more information, see OCPBUGS-23406.

Redundant kube-rbac-proxy sidecar removed

The Operator no longer includes the redundant kube-rbac-proxy sidecar container, reducing resource usage and complexity.
For more information, see CM-436.

## New features and enhancements

FIPS compliance support

With this release, FIPS mode is now automatically enabled for cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift. When installed on an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster in FIPS mode, cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift ensures compatibility without affecting the cluster&#8217;s FIPS support status.

Securing routes with cert-manager managed certificates (Technology Preview)

With this release, you can manage certificates referenced in Route resources by using the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift. For more information, see Securing routes with the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift.

NCM issuer

The cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift now supports the Nokia NetGuard Certificate Manager (NCM) issuer. The ncm-issuer is a cert-manager external issuer that integrates with the NCM PKI system using a Kubernetes controller to sign certificate requests. This integration streamlines the process of obtaining non-self-signed certificates for applications, ensuring their validity and keeping them updated.


[NOTE]
----
The NCM issuer is validated only with version 1.1.1 and the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift version 1.14.0. This version handles tasks such as issuance, renewal, and managing certificates for the API server and ingress controller of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters.
