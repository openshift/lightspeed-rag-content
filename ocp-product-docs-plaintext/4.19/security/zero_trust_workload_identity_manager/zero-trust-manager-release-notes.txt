## New features and enhancements

### Support for the managed OIDC Discovery Provider Route

* The Operator exposes the SPIREOIDCDiscoveryProvider spec through OpenShift Routes under the domain *.apps.<cluster_domain> for the selected default installation.
* The managedRoute and  externalSecretRef fields have been added to the spireOidcDiscoveryProvider spec.
* The managedRoute field is boolean and is set to true by default. If set to false, the Operator stops managing the route and the existing route will not be deleted automatically. If set back to true, the Operator resumes managing the route. If a route does not exist, the Operator creates a new one. If a route already exists, the Operator will override the user configuration if a conflict exists.
* The externalSecretRef references an externally managed Secret that has the TLS certificate for the oidc-discovery-provider Route host. When provided, this populates the route's .Spec.TLS.ExternalCertificate field. For more information, see Creating a route with externally managed certificate

### Enabling the custom Certificate Authority Time-To-Live for the SPIRE bundle

* The following Time-To-Live (TTL) fields have been added to the SpireServer custom resource definition (CRD) API for SPIRE Server certificate management:
* CAValidity (default: 24h)
* DefaultX509Validity (default: 1h)
* DefaultJWTValidity (default: 5m)
* The default values can be replaced in the server configuration with user-configurable options that give users the flexibility to customize certificate and SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Document (SVID) lifetimes based on their security requirements.

### Enabling Manual User Configurations

* The Operator controller switches to create-only mode once the ztwim.openshift.io/create-only=true annotation is present on the Operator's APIs. This allows resource creation while skipping the updates. A user can update the resources manually to test their configuration. This annotation supports APIs such as SpireServer, SpireAgents, SpiffeCSIDriver, SpireOIDCDiscoveryProvider, and ZeroTrustWorkloadIdentityManager.
* When the annotation is applied, all derived resources including resources created and managed by the Operator.
* Once the annotation is removed and the pod restarts, the operator tries to come back to the required state. The annotation is applied only once during start or a restart.

## Bug fixes

* Before this update, the JwtIssuer field for both the SpireServer and the SpireOidcDiscoveryProvider did not need to be a URL causing an error in configurations. With this release, the user must manually enter an issuer URL in the JwtIssuer field in both custom resources. (SPIRE-117)
