# Tailoring the Compliance Operator


While the Compliance Operator comes with ready-to-use profiles, they must be modified to fit the organizations’ needs and requirements. The process of modifying a profile is called tailoring.
The Compliance Operator provides the TailoredProfile object to help tailor profiles.

# Creating a new tailored profile

You can write a tailored profile from scratch by using the TailoredProfile object. Set an appropriate title and description and leave the extends field empty. Indicate to the Compliance Operator what type of scan this custom profile will generate:

* Node scan: Scans the Operating System.
* Platform scan: Scans the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform configuration.

* Set the following annotation on the TailoredProfile object:


```yaml
apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: TailoredProfile
metadata:
  name: new-profile
  annotations:
    compliance.openshift.io/product-type: Node 1
spec:
  extends: ocp4-cis-node 2
  description: My custom profile 3
  title: Custom profile 4
  enableRules:
    - name: ocp4-etcd-unique-ca
      rationale: We really need to enable this
  disableRules:
    - name: ocp4-file-groupowner-cni-conf
      rationale: This does not apply to the cluster
```


Set Node or Platform accordingly.
The extends field is optional.
Use the description field to describe the function of the new TailoredProfile object.
Give your TailoredProfile object a title with the title field.

[NOTE]
----
Adding the -node suffix to the name field of the TailoredProfile object is similar to adding the Node product type annotation and generates an Operating System scan.

# Using tailored profiles to extend existing ProfileBundles

While the TailoredProfile CR enables the most common tailoring operations, the XCCDF standard allows even more flexibility in tailoring OpenSCAP profiles. In addition, if your organization has been using OpenScap previously, you may have an existing XCCDF tailoring file and can reuse it.

The ComplianceSuite object contains an optional TailoringConfigMap attribute that you can point to a custom tailoring file. The value of the TailoringConfigMap attribute is a name of a config map, which must contain a key called tailoring.xml and the value of this key is the tailoring contents.

1. Browse the available rules for the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) ProfileBundle:

```terminal
$ oc get rules.compliance -n openshift-compliance -l compliance.openshift.io/profile-bundle=rhcos4
```

2. Browse the available variables in the same ProfileBundle:

```terminal
$ oc get variables.compliance -n openshift-compliance -l compliance.openshift.io/profile-bundle=rhcos4
```

3. Create a tailored profile named nist-moderate-modified:
1. Choose which rules you want to add to the nist-moderate-modified tailored profile. This example extends the rhcos4-moderate profile by disabling two rules and changing one value. Use the rationale value to describe why these changes were made:
Example new-profile-node.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: TailoredProfile
metadata:
  name: nist-moderate-modified
spec:
  extends: rhcos4-moderate
  description: NIST moderate profile
  title: My modified NIST moderate profile
  disableRules:
  - name: rhcos4-file-permissions-var-log-messages
    rationale: The file contains logs of error messages in the system
  - name: rhcos4-account-disable-post-pw-expiration
    rationale: No need to check this as it comes from the IdP
  setValues:
  - name: rhcos4-var-selinux-state
    rationale: Organizational requirements
    value: permissive
```

Attributes for spec variables

2. Add the tailoredProfile.spec.manualRules attribute:
Example tailoredProfile.spec.manualRules.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: TailoredProfile
metadata:
  name: ocp4-manual-scc-check
spec:
  extends: ocp4-cis
  description: This profile extends ocp4-cis by forcing the SCC check to always return MANUAL
  title: OCP4 CIS profile with manual SCC check
  manualRules:
    - name: ocp4-scc-limit-container-allowed-capabilities
      rationale: We use third party software that installs its own SCC with extra privileges
```

3. Create the TailoredProfile object:

```terminal
$ oc create -n openshift-compliance -f new-profile-node.yaml 1
```

The TailoredProfile object is created in the default openshift-compliance namespace.
Example output

```terminal
tailoredprofile.compliance.openshift.io/nist-moderate-modified created
```

4. Define the ScanSettingBinding object to bind the new nist-moderate-modified tailored profile to the default ScanSetting object.
Example new-scansettingbinding.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ScanSettingBinding
metadata:
  name: nist-moderate-modified
profiles:
  - apiGroup: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Profile
    name: ocp4-moderate
  - apiGroup: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
    kind: TailoredProfile
    name: nist-moderate-modified
settingsRef:
  apiGroup: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
  kind: ScanSetting
  name: default
```

5. Create the ScanSettingBinding object:

```terminal
$ oc create -n openshift-compliance -f new-scansettingbinding.yaml
```

Example output

```terminal
scansettingbinding.compliance.openshift.io/nist-moderate-modified created
```
