# Installing the Compliance Operator


Before you can use the Compliance Operator, you must ensure it is deployed in the cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
----
The Compliance Operator might report incorrect results on managed platforms, such as OpenShift Dedicated, Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS Classic, and Microsoft Azure Red Hat OpenShift. For more information, see the Knowledgebase article Compliance Operator reports incorrect results on Managed Services.
----

[IMPORTANT]
----
Before deploying the Compliance Operator, you are required to define persistent storage in your cluster to store the raw results output. For more information, see Persistant storage overview and Managing the default storage class.

# Installing the Compliance Operator through the web console

* You must have admin privileges.
* You must have a StorageClass resource configured.

1. In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, navigate to Operators -> OperatorHub.
2. Search for the Compliance Operator, then click Install.
3. Keep the default selection of Installation mode and namespace to ensure that the Operator will be installed to the openshift-compliance namespace.
4. Click Install.

To confirm that the installation is successful:

1. Navigate to the Operators -> Installed Operators page.
2. Check that the Compliance Operator is installed in the openshift-compliance namespace and its status is Succeeded.

If the Operator is not installed successfully:

1. Navigate to the Operators -> Installed Operators page and inspect the Status column for any errors or failures.
2. Navigate to the Workloads -> Pods page and check the logs in any pods in the openshift-compliance project that are reporting issues.


[IMPORTANT]
----
If the restricted Security Context Constraints (SCC) have been modified to contain the system:authenticated group or has added requiredDropCapabilities, the Compliance Operator may not function properly due to permissions issues.
You can create a custom SCC for the Compliance Operator scanner pod service account. For more information, see Creating a custom SCC for the Compliance Operator.

# Installing the Compliance Operator using the CLI

* You must have admin privileges.
* You must have a StorageClass resource configured.

1. Define a Namespace object:
Example namespace-object.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  labels:
    openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: privileged 1
  name: openshift-compliance
```

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19, the pod security label must be set to privileged at the namespace level.
2. Create the Namespace object:

```terminal
$ oc create -f namespace-object.yaml
```

3. Define an OperatorGroup object:
Example operator-group-object.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: compliance-operator
  namespace: openshift-compliance
spec:
  targetNamespaces:
  - openshift-compliance
```

4. Create the OperatorGroup object:

```terminal
$ oc create -f operator-group-object.yaml
```

5. Define a Subscription object:
Example subscription-object.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: compliance-operator-sub
  namespace: openshift-compliance
spec:
  channel: "stable"
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
  name: compliance-operator
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
```

6. Create the Subscription object:

```terminal
$ oc create -f subscription-object.yaml
```



[NOTE]
----
If you are setting the global scheduler feature and enable defaultNodeSelector, you must create the namespace manually and update the annotations of the openshift-compliance namespace, or the namespace where the Compliance Operator was installed, with openshift.io/node-selector: “”. This removes the default node selector and prevents deployment failures.
----

1. Verify the installation succeeded by inspecting the CSV file:

```terminal
$ oc get csv -n openshift-compliance
```

2. Verify that the Compliance Operator is up and running:

```terminal
$ oc get deploy -n openshift-compliance
```


# Installing the Compliance Operator on ROSA hosted control planes (HCP)

As of the Compliance Operator 1.5.0 release, the Operator is tested against Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS using Hosted control planes.

Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS Hosted control planes clusters have restricted access to the control plane, which is managed by Red&#160;Hat. By default, the Compliance Operator will schedule to nodes within the master node pool, which is not available in Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS Hosted control planes installations. This requires you to configure the Subscription object in a way that allows the Operator to schedule on available node pools. This step is necessary for a successful installation on Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS Hosted control planes clusters.

* You must have admin privileges.
* You must have a StorageClass resource configured.

1. Define a Namespace object:
Example namespace-object.yaml file

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  labels:
    openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: privileged 1
  name: openshift-compliance
```

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19, the pod security label must be set to privileged at the namespace level.
2. Create the Namespace object by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f namespace-object.yaml
```

3. Define an OperatorGroup object:
Example operator-group-object.yaml file

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: compliance-operator
  namespace: openshift-compliance
spec:
  targetNamespaces:
  - openshift-compliance
```

4. Create the OperatorGroup object by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f operator-group-object.yaml
```

5. Define a Subscription object:
Example subscription-object.yaml file

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: compliance-operator-sub
  namespace: openshift-compliance
spec:
  channel: "stable"
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
  name: compliance-operator
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
  config:
    nodeSelector:
      node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: "" 1
```

Update the Operator deployment to deploy on worker nodes.
6. Create the Subscription object by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f subscription-object.yaml
```


1. Verify that the installation succeeded by running the following command to inspect the cluster service version (CSV) file:

```terminal
$ oc get csv -n openshift-compliance
```

2. Verify that the Compliance Operator is up and running by using the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get deploy -n openshift-compliance
```



[IMPORTANT]
----
If the restricted Security Context Constraints (SCC) have been modified to contain the system:authenticated group or has added requiredDropCapabilities, the Compliance Operator may not function properly due to permissions issues.
You can create a custom SCC for the Compliance Operator scanner pod service account. For more information, see Creating a custom SCC for the Compliance Operator.
