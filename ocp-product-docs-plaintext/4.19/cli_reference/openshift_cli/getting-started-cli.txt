```terminal
# subscription-manager register
```

2. Pull the latest subscription data:

```terminal
# subscription-manager refresh
```

3. List the available subscriptions:

```terminal
# subscription-manager list --available --matches '*OpenShift*'
```

4. In the output for the previous command, find the pool ID for
an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
subscription and attach the subscription to the registered system:

```terminal
# subscription-manager attach --pool=<pool_id>
```

```


* Verify your installation by using an oc command:


```terminal
$ oc <command>
```


# Logging in to the OpenShift CLI

You can log in to the OpenShift CLI (oc) to access and manage your cluster.

* You must have access to a Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* The OpenShift CLI (`oc`) is installed.


[NOTE]
----
To access a cluster that is accessible only over an HTTP proxy server, you can set the HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY and NO_PROXY variables.
These environment variables are respected by the oc CLI so that all communication with the cluster goes through the HTTP proxy.
Authentication headers are sent only when using HTTPS transport.
----

1. Enter the oc login command and pass in a user name:

```terminal
$ oc login -u user1
```

2. When prompted, enter the required information:
Example output

```terminal
Server [https://localhost:8443]: https://openshift.example.com:6443 1
The server uses a certificate signed by an unknown authority.
You can bypass the certificate check, but any data you send to the server could be intercepted by others.
Use insecure connections? (y/n): y 2

Authentication required for https://openshift.example.com:6443 (openshift)
Username: user1
Password: 3
Login successful.

You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running

    oc new-project <projectname>

Welcome! See 'oc help' to get started.
```

Enter the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform server URL.
Enter whether to use insecure connections.
Enter the user's password.


[NOTE]
----
If you are logged in to the web console, you can generate an oc login command that includes your token and server information. You can use the command to log in to the
OpenShift CLI (oc) without the interactive prompts. To generate the command, select Copy login command from the username drop-down menu at the top right of the web console.
----

You can now create a project or issue other commands for managing your cluster.

# Logging in to the OpenShift CLI using a web browser

You can log in to the OpenShift CLI (oc) with the help of a web browser to access and manage your cluster. This allows users to avoid inserting their access token into the command line.


[WARNING]
----
Logging in to the CLI through the web browser runs a server on localhost with HTTP, not HTTPS; use with caution on multi-user workstations.
----

* You must have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* You must have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You must have a browser installed.

1. Enter the oc login command with the --web flag:

```terminal
$ oc login <cluster_url> --web 1
```

Optionally, you can specify the server URL and callback port. For example, oc login <cluster_url> --web --callback-port 8280 localhost:8443.
2. The web browser opens automatically. If it does not, click the link in the command output. If you do not specify the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform server oc tries to open the web console of the cluster specified in the current oc configuration file. If no oc configuration exists, oc prompts interactively for the server URL.
Example output

```terminal
Opening login URL in the default browser: https://openshift.example.com
Opening in existing browser session.
```

3. If more than one identity provider is available, select your choice from the options provided.
4. Enter your username and password into the corresponding browser fields. After you are logged in, the browser displays the text access token received successfully; please return to your terminal.
5. Check the CLI for a login confirmation.
Example output

```terminal
Login successful.

You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running

    oc new-project <projectname>
```



[NOTE]
----
The web console defaults to the profile used in the previous session. To switch between Administrator and Developer profiles, log out of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console and clear the cache.
----

You can now create a project or issue other commands for managing your cluster.

# Getting help

You can get help with CLI commands and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
resources in the following ways:

* Use oc help to get a list and description of all available CLI commands:
Example: Get general help for the CLI

```terminal
$ oc help
```

Example output

```terminal
OpenShift Client

This client helps you develop, build, deploy, and run your applications on any OpenShift or Kubernetes compatible
platform. It also includes the administrative commands for managing a cluster under the 'adm' subcommand.

Usage:
  oc [flags]

Basic Commands:
  login           Log in to a server
  new-project     Request a new project
  new-app         Create a new application

...
```

* Use the --help flag to get help about a specific CLI command:
Example: Get help for the oc create command

```terminal
$ oc create --help
```

Example output

```terminal
Create a resource by filename or stdin

JSON and YAML formats are accepted.

Usage:
  oc create -f FILENAME [flags]

...
```

* Use the oc explain command to view the description and fields for a
particular resource:
Example: View documentation for the Pod resource

```terminal
$ oc explain pods
```

Example output

```terminal
KIND:     Pod
VERSION:  v1

DESCRIPTION:
     Pod is a collection of containers that can run on a host. This resource is
     created by clients and scheduled onto hosts.

FIELDS:
   apiVersion	<string>
     APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an
     object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal
     value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#resources

...
```


# Logging out of the OpenShift CLI

You can log out the OpenShift CLI to end your current session.

* Use the oc logout command.

```terminal
$ oc logout
```

Example output

```terminal
