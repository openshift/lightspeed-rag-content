# Enabling dedicated resources for virtual machines


To improve performance, you can dedicate node resources, such as CPU, to a virtual machine.

# About dedicated resources

When you enable dedicated resources for your virtual machine, your virtual
machine&#8217;s workload is scheduled on CPUs that will not be used by other
processes. By using dedicated resources, you can improve the performance of the
virtual machine and the accuracy of latency predictions.

# Enabling dedicated resources for a virtual machine

You enable dedicated resources for a {object} in the Details tab. Virtual machines that were created from a Red Hat template can be configured with dedicated resources.

* The CPU Manager must be configured on the node. Verify that the node has the cpumanager = true label before scheduling virtual machine workloads.
* The virtual machine must be powered off.

1. In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform console, click Virtualization -> {object-gui}s from the side menu.
2. Select a {object} to open the {object-gui} details page.
3. On the {tab} tab, click the edit icon beside Dedicated Resources.
4. Select Schedule this workload with dedicated resources (guaranteed policy).
5. Click Save.
