# Connecting a virtual machine to an OVN-Kubernetes layer 2 secondary network


You can connect a virtual machine (VM) to an OVN-Kubernetes layer2 secondary network by using the CLI.
A layer2 topology connects workloads by a cluster-wide logical switch. The OVN-Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin uses the Geneve (Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation) protocol to create an overlay network between nodes. You can use this overlay network to connect VMs on different nodes, without having to configure any additional physical networking infrastructure.

[NOTE]
----
An OVN-Kubernetes secondary network is compatible with the multi-network policy API which provides the MultiNetworkPolicy custom resource definition (CRD) to control traffic flow to and from VMs. You must use the ipBlock attribute to define network policy ingress and egress rules for specific CIDR blocks. You cannot use pod or namespace selectors for virtualization workloads.
----
To configure an OVN-Kubernetes layer2 secondary network and attach a VM to that network, perform the following steps:
1. Configure an OVN-Kubernetes layer 2 secondary network.
2. Connect the VM to the OVN-Kubernetes layer 2 secondary network.

# Creating an OVN-Kubernetes layer 2 NAD

You can create an OVN-Kubernetes network attachment definition (NAD) for the layer 2 network topology by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console or the CLI.


[NOTE]
----
Configuring IP address management (IPAM) by specifying the spec.config.ipam.subnet attribute in a network attachment definition for virtual machines is not supported.

## Creating a NAD for layer 2 topology by using the CLI

You can create a network attachment definition (NAD) which describes how to attach a pod to the layer 2 overlay network.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

1. Create a NetworkAttachmentDefinition object:

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: l2-network
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  config: |-
    {
            "cniVersion": "0.3.1", 1
            "name": "my-namespace-l2-network", 2
            "type": "ovn-k8s-cni-overlay", 3
            "topology":"layer2", 4
            "mtu": 1400, 5
            "netAttachDefName": "my-namespace/l2-network" 6
    }
```

The Container Network Interface (CNI) specification version. The required value is 0.3.1.
The name of the network. This attribute is not namespaced. For example, you can have a network named l2-network referenced from two different NetworkAttachmentDefinition objects that exist in two different namespaces. This feature is useful to connect VMs in different namespaces.
The name of the CNI plugin. The required value is ovn-k8s-cni-overlay.
The topological configuration for the network. The required value is layer2.
Optional: The maximum transmission unit (MTU) value. If you do not set a value, the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) sets a default MTU value by calculating the difference among the underlay MTU of the primary network interface, the overlay MTU of the pod network, such as the Geneve (Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation), and byte capacity of any enabled features, such as IPsec.
The value of the namespace and name fields in the metadata stanza of the NetworkAttachmentDefinition object.

[NOTE]
----
The previous example configures a cluster-wide overlay without a subnet defined. This means that the logical switch implementing the network only provides layer 2 communication. You must configure an IP address when you create the virtual machine by either setting a static IP address or by deploying a DHCP server on the network for a dynamic IP address.
----
2. Apply the manifest by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
```


## Creating a NAD for layer 2 topology by using the web console

You can create a network attachment definition (NAD) that describes how to attach a pod to the layer 2 overlay network.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

1. Go to Networking -> NetworkAttachmentDefinitions in the web console.
2. Click Create Network Attachment Definition. The network attachment definition must be in the same namespace as the pod or virtual machine using it.
3. Enter a unique Name and optional Description.
4. Select OVN Kubernetes L2 overlay network from the Network Type list.
5. Click Create.

# Attaching a virtual machine to the OVN-Kubernetes layer 2 secondary network

You can attach a virtual machine (VM) to the OVN-Kubernetes layer 2 secondary network interface by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console or the CLI.

## Attaching a virtual machine to an OVN-Kubernetes secondary network using the CLI

You can connect a virtual machine (VM) to the OVN-Kubernetes secondary network by including the network details in the VM configuration.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Edit the VirtualMachine manifest to add the OVN-Kubernetes secondary network interface details, as in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  name: vm-server
spec:
  runStrategy: Always
  template:
    spec:
      domain:
        devices:
          interfaces:
          - name: secondary 1
            bridge: {}
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: 1024Mi
      networks:
      - name: secondary  2
        multus:
          networkName: <nad_name> 3
      nodeSelector:
        node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: '' 4
# ...
```

The name of the OVN-Kubernetes secondary interface.
The name of the network. This must match the value of the spec.template.spec.domain.devices.interfaces.name field.
The name of the NetworkAttachmentDefinition object.
Specifies the nodes on which the VM can be scheduled. The recommended node selector value is node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ''.
2. Apply the VirtualMachine manifest:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
```

3. Optional: If you edited a running virtual machine, you must restart it for the changes to take effect.
