# Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19 release notes


Red Hat Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform provides developers and IT organizations with a hybrid cloud application platform for deploying both new and existing applications on secure, scalable resources with minimal configuration and management. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform supports a wide selection of programming languages and frameworks, such as Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and PHP.
Built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and Kubernetes, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform provides a more secure and scalable multitenant operating system for today's enterprise-class applications, while delivering integrated application runtimes and libraries. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform enables organizations to meet security, privacy, compliance, and governance requirements.

# About this release

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHSA-202X:XXXX) is now available. This release uses Kubernetes 1.32 with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19 are included in this topic.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19 clusters are available at https://console.redhat.com/openshift. From the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console, you can deploy Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters to either on-premises or cloud environments.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19 is supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.8 and a later version of RHEL 8 that is released before End of Life of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19 is also supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) 4.19. To understand RHEL versions used by RHCOS, see RHEL Versions Utilized by Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (Knowledgebase article).

You must use RHCOS machines for the control plane, and you can use either RHCOS or RHEL for compute machines. RHEL machines are deprecated in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 and will be removed in a future release.

Starting from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14, the Extended Update Support (EUS) phase for even-numbered releases increases the total available lifecycle to 24 months on all supported architectures, including x86_64, 64-bit ARM (aarch64), IBM Power&#174; (ppc64le), and IBM Z&#174; (s390x) architectures. Beyond this, Red&#160;Hat also offers a 12-month additional EUS add-on, denoted as Additional EUS Term 2, that extends the total available lifecycle from 24 months to 36 months. The Additional EUS Term 2 is available on all architecture variants of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. For more information about support for all versions, see the Red Hat Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy.

Commencing with the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14 release, Red&#160;Hat is simplifying the administration and management of Red&#160;Hat shipped cluster Operators with the introduction of three new life cycle classifications; Platform Aligned, Platform Agnostic, and Rolling Stream. These life cycle classifications provide additional ease and transparency for cluster administrators to understand the life cycle policies of each Operator and form cluster maintenance and upgrade plans with predictable support boundaries. For more information, see OpenShift Operator Life Cycles.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is designed for FIPS. When running Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) booted in FIPS mode, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform core components use the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures.

For more information about the NIST validation program, see Cryptographic Module Validation Program. For the latest NIST status for the individual versions of RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted for validation, see Compliance Activities and Government Standards.

# Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform layered and dependent component support and compatibility

The scope of support for layered and dependent components of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform changes independently of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version. To determine the current support status and compatibility for an add-on, refer to its release notes. For more information, see the Red Hat Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy.

# New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts:

## Authentication and authorization



## Backup and restore



## Builds



## Cluster Resource Override Admission Operator



## Edge computing



## Extensions (OLM v1)



## Hosted control planes

Because hosted control planes releases asynchronously from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, it has its own release notes. For more information, see Hosted control planes release notes.

## IBM Power

The IBM Power&#174; release on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19 adds improvements and new capabilities to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform components.

This release introduces support for the following features on IBM Power:

## IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE

## IBM Power, IBM Z, and IBM LinuxONE support matrix

Starting in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14, Extended Update Support (EUS) is extended to the IBM Power&#174; and the IBM Z&#174; platform. For more information, see the OpenShift EUS Overview.





1. Persistent shared storage must be provisioned by using either Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation or other supported storage protocols.
2. Persistent non-shared storage must be provisioned by using local storage, such as iSCSI, FC, or by using LSO with DASD, FCP, or EDEV/FBA.

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19, the installation program uses the Cluster API instead of Terraform to provision cluster infrastructure during installations on IBM Cloud.

## Machine Config Operator



## Management console



## Monitoring



## Network Observability Operator



## Networking

### Support for using the Gateway API to configure cluster Ingress traffic

We will have details here when Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19 is released.

### Dual-port NICs for improved redundancy in PTP ordinary clocks (Technology Preview)

With this release, you can use a dual-port network interface controller (NIC) to improve redundancy for Precision Time Protocol (PTP) ordinary clocks.
Available as a Technology Preview, in a dual-port NIC configuration for an ordinary clock, if one port fails, the standby port takes over, maintaining PTP timing synchronization.


[NOTE]
----
You can configure PTP ordinary clocks with added redundancy on x86 architecture nodes with dual-port NICs only.
----

For more information, see Using dual-port NICs to improve redundancy for PTP ordinary clocks.

### Tuning hosted control planes using a performance profile

With this update, you can now tune nodes in hosted control planes for low latency by applying a performance profile. For more information, see Creating a performance profile for hosted control planes.

## Security

### Control plane now supports TLS 1.3 and the Modern TLS security profile

With this release, the control plane supports TLS 1.3. You can now use the Modern TLS security profile for the control plane.

## Notice of future deprecation



# Bug fixes

## API Server and Authentication

## Bare Metal Hardware Provisioning

## Builds

## Cloud Compute

## Cloud Credential Operator

## Cluster Resource Override Admission Operator

## Cluster Version Operator

## Developer Console

## Driver ToolKit (DTK)

## etcd Cluster Operator

## Image Registry

## Installer

* Previously, if you attempted to install an Amazon Web Services (AWS) cluster with minimum privileges and you did not specify an instance type in the install-config.yaml file, installation of the cluster failed. This issue happened because the installation program could not find supported instance types that the cluster uses in availability zones. For example, the m6i.xlarge default instance type was unavailable in ap-southeast-4 and eu-south-2 availability zones. With this release, the openshift-install program now requires the ec2:DescribeInstanceTypeOfferings AWS permission to prevent the installation of the cluster from failing in situations where m6i.xlarge or another supported instance type is unavailable in a supported availability zone.
