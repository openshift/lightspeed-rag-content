# Boot image management


For Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) clusters, by default the Machine Config Operator (MCO) manages and updates the boot image that is used to scale up your nodes. This means that by default, the MCO updates the boot images whenever you upgrade your cluster.
For all other platforms, the MCO does not update the boot image with each cluster update.

# About boot image management

By default, for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) clusters, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) updates the boot image in the machine sets in your cluster whenever you update your cluster.

For GCP and AWS, you can disable the boot image management feature, if needed. When the feature is disabled, the boot image no longer updates with the cluster. For example, with the feature disabled, if your cluster was originally created with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, the boot image that the MCO would use to create nodes is the same 4.16 version, even if your cluster is at a later version.

However, using an older boot image could cause the following issues:

* Extra time to start nodes
* Certificate expiration issues
* Version skew issues

For information on how to disable this feature, see "Disabling boot image management". If you disable this feature, you can re-enable the feature at any time. For information, see "Enabling boot image management".


[NOTE]
----
The ability to configure boot image management is available for only GCP and AWS clusters. It is not supported for clusters managed by the Cluster CAPI Operator.
----

How the cluster behaves after disabling or re-enabling the feature, depends upon when you made the change, including the following scenarios:

* If you disable the feature before updating to a new Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version:
* The boot image version used by the machine sets remains the same Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version as when the feature was disabled.
* When you scale up nodes, the new nodes use that same Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version.
* If you disable the feature after updating to a new Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version:
* The boot image version used by the machine sets is updated to match the updated Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version.
* When you scale up nodes, the new nodes use the updated Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version.
* If you update to a later Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version, the boot image version in the machine sets remains at the current version and is not updated with the cluster.
* If you enable the feature after disabling:
* The boot image version used by the machine sets is updated to the current Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version, if different.
* When you scale up nodes, the new nodes use the current Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version in the cluster.


[NOTE]
----
Because a boot image is used only when a node is scaled up, this feature has no effect on existing nodes.
----

To view the current boot image used in your cluster, examine a machine set.


[NOTE]
----
The location and format of the boot image within the machine set differs, based on the platform. However, the boot image is always listed in the spec.template.spec.providerSpec. parameter.
----


```yaml
apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: MachineSet
metadata:
  name: ci-ln-hmy310k-72292-5f87z-worker-a
  namespace: openshift-machine-api
spec:
# ...
  template:
# ...
    spec:
# ...
      providerSpec:
# ...
        value:
          disks:
          - autoDelete: true
            boot: true
            image: projects/rhcos-cloud/global/images/rhcos-412-85-202203181601-0-gcp-x86-64 1
# ...
```


This boot image is the same as the originally-installed Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version, in this example Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, regardless of the current version of the cluster. The way that the boot image is represented in the machine set depends on the platform, as the structure of the providerSpec field differs from platform to platform.


```yaml
apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: MachineSet
metadata:
  name: ci-ln-hmy310k-72292-5f87z-worker-a
  namespace: openshift-machine-api
spec:
# ...
  template:
# ...
    spec:
# ...
      providerSpec:
         value:
          ami:
            id: ami-0e8fd9094e487d1ff
# ...
```



[IMPORTANT]
----
If any of the machine sets for which you want to enable boot image management use a *-user-data secret that is based on Ignition version 2.2.0, the Machine Config Operator converts the Ignition version to 3.4.0 when you enable the feature. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform versions 4.5 and lower use Ignition version 2.2.0. If this conversion fails, the MCO or your cluster could degrade. An error message that includes err: converting ignition stub failed: failed to parse Ignition config is added to the output of the oc get ClusterOperator machine-config command. You can use the following general steps to correct the problem:
1. Disable the boot image management feature. For information, see "Disabling boot image management".
2. Manually update the *-user-data secret to use Ignition version to 3.2.0.
3. Enable the boot image management feature. For information, see "Enabling boot image management".

# Disabling boot image management

By default, for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) clusters, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) manages and updates the boot image in the machine sets in your cluster whenever you update your cluster.

You can disable the boot image management feature for your cluster by editing the MachineConfiguration object. When disabled, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) no longer manages the boot image in your cluster and no longer updates the boot image with each cluster update.

Disabling this feature does not rollback the nodes or machine sets to the originally-installed boot image. The machine sets retain the boot image version that was present when the feature was disabled and is not updated if the cluster is upgraded to a new Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version in the future. This feature has no effect on existing nodes.

After disabling the feature in a GCP or AWS cluster, you can re-enable the feature at any time. For more information, see "Enabling updated boot images".

1. Edit the MachineConfiguration object to disable the boot image management feature for some or all of your machine sets:

```terminal
$ oc edit MachineConfiguration cluster
```

* Optional: Disable the feature for all machine sets:

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfiguration
metadata:
  name: cluster
  namespace: openshift-machine-config-operator
spec:
# ...
  managedBootImages: 1
    machineManagers:
    - apiGroup: machine.openshift.io 2
      resource: machinesets 3
      selection:
        mode: None 4
```

Configures the boot image management feature.
Specifies an API group. This must be machine.openshift.io.
Specifies the resource within the specified API group to apply the change. This must be machinesets.
Specifies that the feature is disabled for all machine sets in the cluster.

* View the current state of the boot image management feature by viewing the machine configuration object:

```terminal
$ oc get machineconfiguration cluster -o yaml
```

Example machine set with the boot image reference

```yaml
kind: MachineConfiguration
metadata:
  name: cluster
# ...

```

* Get the boot image version by running the following command. The location and format of the boot image within the machine set differs, based on the platform. However, the boot image is always listed in the spec.template.spec.providerSpec. parameter.

```terminal
$ oc get machinesets <machineset_name> -n openshift-machine-api -o yaml
```

Example machine set with the boot image reference

```yaml
apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: MachineSet
metadata:
  labels:
    machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-cluster: ci-ln-77hmkpt-72292-d4pxp
    update-boot-image: "true"
  name: ci-ln-77hmkpt-72292-d4pxp-worker-a
  namespace: openshift-machine-api
spec:
# ...
  template:

        value:
          disks:
          - autoDelete: true
            boot: true
            image: projects/rhcos-cloud/global/images/<boot_image> 1
# ...
```

This boot image is the same as the current Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version.

# Enabling boot image management

By default, for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) clusters, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) updates the boot image in the machine sets in your cluster whenever you update your cluster.

If you disabled the boot image management feature, so that the boot images are not updated, you can re-enable the feature by editing the MachineConfiguration object.

Enabling the feature updates the boot image to the current Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version. If the cluster is again updated to a new Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version in the future, the boot image is updated again. New nodes created after enabling the feature use the updated boot image. This feature has no effect on existing nodes.

1. Edit the MachineConfiguration object, named cluster, to enable the boot image management feature for some or all of your machine sets:

```terminal
$ oc edit MachineConfiguration cluster
```

* Optional: Enable the boot image management feature for all machine sets:

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfiguration
metadata:
  name: cluster
  namespace: openshift-machine-config-operator
spec:
# ...
  managedBootImages: 1
    machineManagers:
    - apiGroup: machine.openshift.io 2
      resource: machinesets 3
      selection:
        mode: All 4
```

Configures the boot image management feature.
Specifies the API group. This must be machine.openshift.io.
Specifies the resource within the specified API group to apply the change. This must be machinesets.
Specifies that the feature is enabled for all machine sets in the cluster.
* Optional: Enable the boot image management feature for specific machine sets:

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfiguration
metadata:
  name: cluster
  namespace: openshift-machine-config-operator
spec:
# ...
  managedBootImages: 1
    machineManagers:
    - apiGroup: machine.openshift.io 2
      resource: machinesets 3
      selection:
        mode: Partial 4
        partial:
          machineResourceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              region: "east"
```

Configures the boot image update feature.
Specifies the API group. This must be machine.openshift.io.
Specifies the resource within the specified API group to apply the change. This must be machinesets.
Specifies that the feature is enabled for machine sets with the specified label.

[TIP]
----
If an appropriate label is not present on the machine set, add a key-value pair by running a command similar to following:

```
$ oc label machineset.machine ci-ln-hmy310k-72292-5f87z-worker-a region: "east" -n openshift-machine-api
```
