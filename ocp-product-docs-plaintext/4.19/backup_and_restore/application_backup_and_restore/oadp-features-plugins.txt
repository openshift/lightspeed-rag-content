# OADP features and plugins


OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) features provide options for backing up and restoring applications.
The default plugins enable Velero to integrate with certain cloud providers and to back up and restore Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform resources.

# OADP features

OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) supports the following features:

Backup:: You can use OADP to back up all applications on the OpenShift Platform, or you can filter the resources by type, namespace, or label.

OADP backs up Kubernetes objects and internal images by saving them as an archive file on object storage. OADP backs up persistent volumes (PVs) by creating snapshots with the native cloud snapshot API or with the Container Storage Interface (CSI). For cloud providers that do not support snapshots, OADP backs up resources and PV data with Restic.

[NOTE]
----
You must exclude Operators from the backup of an application for backup and restore to succeed.
----
Restore:: You can restore resources and PVs from a backup. You can restore all objects in a backup or filter the objects by namespace, PV, or label.

[NOTE]
----
You must exclude Operators from the backup of an application for backup and restore to succeed.
----
Schedule:: You can schedule backups at specified intervals.
Hooks:: You can use hooks to run commands in a container on a pod, for example, fsfreeze to freeze a file system. You can configure a hook to run before or after a backup or restore. Restore hooks can run in an init container or in the application container.

# OADP plugins

The OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) provides default Velero plugins that are integrated with storage providers to support backup and snapshot operations. You can create custom plugins based on the Velero plugins.

OADP also provides plugins for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform resource backups, OpenShift Virtualization resource backups, and Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots.



1. Mandatory.
2. Virtual machine disks are backed up with CSI snapshots or Restic.
3. The csi plugin uses the Kubernetes CSI snapshot API.
* OADP 1.1 or later uses snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1
* OADP 1.0 uses snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
4. OADP 1.2 only.

# About OADP Velero plugins

You can configure two types of plugins when you install Velero:

* Default cloud provider plugins
* Custom plugins

Both types of plugin are optional, but most users configure at least one cloud provider plugin.

## Default Velero cloud provider plugins

You can install any of the following default Velero cloud provider plugins when you configure the oadp_v1alpha1_dpa.yaml file during deployment:

* aws (Amazon Web Services)
* gcp (Google Cloud Platform)
* azure (Microsoft Azure)
* openshift (OpenShift Velero plugin)
* csi (Container Storage Interface)
* kubevirt (KubeVirt)

You specify the desired default plugins in the oadp_v1alpha1_dpa.yaml file during deployment.

The following .yaml file installs the openshift, aws, azure, and gcp plugins:


```yaml
 apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
 kind: DataProtectionApplication
 metadata:
   name: dpa-sample
 spec:
   configuration:
     velero:
       defaultPlugins:
       - openshift
       - aws
       - azure
       - gcp
```


## Custom Velero plugins

You can install a custom Velero plugin by specifying the plugin image and name when you configure the oadp_v1alpha1_dpa.yaml file during deployment.

You specify the desired custom plugins in the oadp_v1alpha1_dpa.yaml file during deployment.

The following .yaml file installs the default openshift, azure, and gcp plugins and a custom plugin that has the name custom-plugin-example and the image quay.io/example-repo/custom-velero-plugin:


```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
metadata:
 name: dpa-sample
spec:
 configuration:
   velero:
     defaultPlugins:
     - openshift
     - azure
     - gcp
     customPlugins:
     - name: custom-plugin-example
       image: quay.io/example-repo/custom-velero-plugin
```


## Velero plugins returning "received EOF, stopping recv loop" message


[NOTE]
----
Velero plugins are started as separate processes. After the Velero operation has completed, either successfully or not, they exit. Receiving a received EOF, stopping recv loop message in the debug logs indicates that a plugin operation has completed. It does not mean that an error has occurred.
----

### Known issue of OADP using IBM Power(R) and IBM Z(R) platforms

* Currently, there are backup method restrictions for Single-node OpenShift clusters deployed on IBM Power(R) and IBM Z(R) platforms. Only NFS storage is currently compatible with Single-node OpenShift clusters on these platforms. In addition, only the File System Backup (FSB) methods such as Kopia and Restic are supported for backup and restore operations. There is currently no workaround for this issue.

# OADP plugins known issues

The following section describes known issues in OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) plugins:

## Velero plugin panics during imagestream backups due to a missing secret

When the backup and the Backup Storage Location (BSL) are managed outside the scope of the Data Protection Application (DPA), the OADP controller, meaning the DPA reconciliation does not create the relevant oadp-<bsl_name>-<bsl_provider>-registry-secret.

When the backup is run, the OpenShift Velero plugin panics on the imagestream backup, with the following panic error:


```terminal
024-02-27T10:46:50.028951744Z time="2024-02-27T10:46:50Z" level=error msg="Error backing up item"
backup=openshift-adp/<backup name> error="error executing custom action (groupResource=imagestreams.image.openshift.io,
namespace=<BSL Name>, name=postgres): rpc error: code = Aborted desc = plugin panicked:
runtime error: index out of range with length 1, stack trace: goroutine 94…
```


### Workaround to avoid the panic error

To avoid the Velero plugin panic error, perform the following steps:

1. Label the custom BSL with the relevant label:

```terminal
$ oc label backupstoragelocations.velero.io <bsl_name> app.kubernetes.io/component=bsl
```

2. After the BSL is labeled, wait until the DPA reconciles.

[NOTE]
----
You can force the reconciliation by making any minor change to the DPA itself.
----
3. When the DPA reconciles, confirm that the relevant oadp-<bsl_name>-<bsl_provider>-registry-secret has been created and that the correct registry data has been populated into it:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-adp get secret/oadp-<bsl_name>-<bsl_provider>-registry-secret -o json | jq -r '.data'
```


## OpenShift ADP Controller segmentation fault

If you configure a DPA with both cloudstorage and restic enabled, the openshift-adp-controller-manager pod crashes and restarts indefinitely until the pod fails with a crash loop segmentation fault.

You can have either velero or cloudstorage defined, because they are mutually exclusive fields.

* If you have both velero and  cloudstorage defined, the openshift-adp-controller-manager fails.
* If you have neither velero nor cloudstorage defined, the openshift-adp-controller-manager fails.

For more information about this issue, see OADP-1054.

### OpenShift ADP Controller segmentation fault workaround

You must define either velero or cloudstorage when you configure a DPA. If you define both APIs in your DPA, the openshift-adp-controller-manager pod fails with a crash loop segmentation fault.

# OADP and FIPS

Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are a set of computer security standards developed by the United States federal government in line with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA).

OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) has been tested and works on FIPS-enabled Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters.
