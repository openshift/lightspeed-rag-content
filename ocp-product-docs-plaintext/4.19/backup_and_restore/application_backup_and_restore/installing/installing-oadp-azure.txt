# Configuring the OpenShift API for Data Protection with Microsoft Azure


You install the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) with Microsoft Azure by installing the OADP Operator. The Operator installs Velero 1.14.

[NOTE]
----
Starting from OADP 1.0.4, all OADP 1.0.z versions can only be used as a dependency of the Migration Toolkit for Containers Operator and are not available as a standalone Operator.
----
You configure Azure for Velero, create a default Secret, and then install the Data Protection Application. For more details, see Installing the OADP Operator.
To install the OADP Operator in a restricted network environment, you must first disable the default OperatorHub sources and mirror the Operator catalog. See Using Operator Lifecycle Manager in disconnected environments for details.

# Configuring Microsoft Azure

You configure Microsoft Azure for OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP).

* You must have the Azure CLI installed.

Tools that use Azure services should always have restricted permissions to make sure that Azure resources are safe. Therefore, instead of having applications sign in as a fully privileged user, Azure offers service principals. An Azure service principal is a name that can be used with applications, hosted services, or automated tools.

This identity is used for access to resources.

* Create a service principal
* Sign in using a service principal and password
* Sign in using a service principal and certificate
* Manage service principal roles
* Create an Azure resource using a service principal
* Reset service principal credentials

For more details, see Create an Azure service principal with Azure CLI.

# About backup and snapshot locations and their secrets

You specify backup and snapshot locations and their secrets in the DataProtectionApplication custom resource (CR).

## Backup locations

You can specify one of the following AWS S3-compatible object storage solutions as a backup location:

* Multicloud Object Gateway (MCG)
* Red Hat Container Storage
* Ceph RADOS Gateway; also known as Ceph Object Gateway
* Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation
* MinIO

Velero backs up Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform resources, Kubernetes objects, and internal images as an archive file on object storage.

## Snapshot locations

If you use your cloud provider&#8217;s native snapshot API to back up persistent volumes, you must specify the cloud provider as the snapshot location.

If you use Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots, you do not need to specify a snapshot location because you will create a VolumeSnapshotClass CR to register the CSI driver.

If you use File System Backup (FSB), you do not need to specify a snapshot location because FSB backs up the file system on object storage.

## Secrets

If the backup and snapshot locations use the same credentials or if you do not require a snapshot location, you create a default Secret.

If the backup and snapshot locations use different credentials, you create two secret objects:

* Custom Secret for the backup location, which you specify in the DataProtectionApplication CR.
* Default Secret for the snapshot location, which is not referenced in the DataProtectionApplication CR.


[IMPORTANT]
----
The Data Protection Application requires a default Secret. Otherwise, the installation will fail.
If you do not want to specify backup or snapshot locations during the installation, you can create a default Secret with an empty credentials-velero file.
----

# About authenticating OADP with Azure

You can authenticate OADP with Azure by using the following methods:

* A Velero-specific service principal with secret-based authentication.
* A Velero-specific storage account access key with secret-based authentication.
* Azure Security Token Service.

# Using a service principal or a storage account access key

You create a default Secret object and reference it in the backup storage location custom resource. The credentials file for the Secret object can contain information about the Azure service principal or a storage account access key.

The default name of the Secret is cloud-credentials-azure.


[NOTE]
----
The DataProtectionApplication custom resource (CR) requires a default Secret.  Otherwise, the installation will fail. If the name of the backup location Secret is not specified, the default name is used.
If you do not want to use the backup location credentials during the installation, you can create a Secret with the default name by using an empty credentials-velero file.
----

* You have access to the OpenShift cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* You have an Azure subscription with appropriate permissions.
* You have installed OADP.
* You have configured an object storage for storing the backups.

1. Create a credentials-velero file for the backup storage location in the appropriate format for your cloud provider.

You can use one of the following two methods to authenticate OADP with Azure.
* Use the service principal with secret-based authentication. See the following example:

```terminal
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<azure_subscription_id>
AZURE_TENANT_ID=<azure_tenant_id>
AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<azure_client_id>
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<azure_client_secret>
AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP=<azure_resource_group>
AZURE_CLOUD_NAME=<azure_cloud_name>
```

* Use a storage account access key. See the following example:

```terminal
AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_ACCESS_KEY=<azure_storage_account_access_key>
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<azure_subscription_id>
AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP=<azure_resource_group>
AZURE_CLOUD_NAME=<azure_cloud_name>
```

2. Create a Secret custom resource (CR) with the default name:

```terminal
$ oc create secret generic cloud-credentials-azure -n openshift-adp --from-file cloud=credentials-velero
```

3. Reference the Secret in the spec.backupLocations.velero.credential block of the DataProtectionApplication CR when you install the Data Protection Application as shown in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
metadata:
  name: <dpa_sample>
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
...
  backupLocations:
    - velero:
        config:
          resourceGroup: <azure_resource_group>
          storageAccount: <azure_storage_account_id>
          subscriptionId: <azure_subscription_id>
        credential:
          key: cloud
          name: <custom_secret> 1
        provider: azure
        default: true
        objectStorage:
          bucket: <bucket_name>
          prefix: <prefix>
  snapshotLocations:
    - velero:
        config:
          resourceGroup: <azure_resource_group>
          subscriptionId: <azure_subscription_id>
          incremental: "true"
        provider: azure
```

Backup location Secret with custom name.

# Using OADP with Azure Security Token Service authentication

You can use Microsoft Entra Workload ID to access Azure storage for OADP backup and restore operations. This approach uses the signed Kubernetes service account tokens of the OpenShift cluster. These token are automatically rotated every hour and exchanged with the Azure Active Directory (AD) access tokens, eliminating the need for long-term client secrets.

To use the Azure Security Token Service (STS) configuration, you need the credentialsMode field set to Manual during cluster installation. This approach uses the Cloud Credential Operator (ccoctl) to set up the workload identity infrastructure, including the OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider, issuer configuration, and user-assigned managed identities.


[NOTE]
----
OADP with Azure STS configuration does not support restic File System Backups (FSB) and restores.
----

* You have an OpenShift cluster installed on Microsoft Azure with Microsoft Entra Workload ID configured. For more details see, Configuring an Azure cluster to use short-term credentials.
* You have the Azure CLI (az) installed and configured.
* You have access to the OpenShift cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* You have an Azure subscription with appropriate permissions.


[NOTE]
----
If your OpenShift cluster was not originally installed with Microsoft Entra Workload ID, you can enable short-term credentials after installation. This post-installation configuration is supported specifically for Azure clusters.
----

1. If your cluster was installed with long-term credentials, you can switch to Microsoft Entra Workload ID authentication after installation. For more details, see Enabling Microsoft Entra Workload ID on an existing cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
----
After enabling Microsoft Entra Workload ID on an existing Azure cluster, you must update all cluster components that use cloud credentials, including OADP, to use the new authentication method.
----
2. Set the environment variables for your Azure STS configuration as shown in the following example:

```terminal
export API_URL=$(oc whoami --show-server) # Get cluster information
export CLUSTER_NAME=$(echo "$API_URL" | sed 's|https://api\.||' | sed 's|\..*||')
export CLUSTER_RESOURCE_GROUP="${CLUSTER_NAME}-rg"

# Get Azure information
export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account show --query id -o tsv)
export AZURE_TENANT_ID=$(az account show --query tenantId -o tsv)

# Set names for resources
export IDENTITY_NAME="velero"
export APP_NAME="velero-${CLUSTER_NAME}"
export STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME=$(echo "velero${CLUSTER_NAME}" | tr -d '-' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | cut -c1-24)
export CONTAINER_NAME="velero"
```

3. Create an Azure Managed Identity for OADP as shown in the following example:

```terminal
az identity create \ # Create managed identity
    --subscription "$AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID" \
    --resource-group "$CLUSTER_RESOURCE_GROUP" \
    --name "$IDENTITY_NAME"

# Get identity details
export IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID=$(az identity show -g "$CLUSTER_RESOURCE_GROUP" -n "$IDENTITY_NAME" --query clientId -o tsv)
export IDENTITY_PRINCIPAL_ID=$(az identity show -g "$CLUSTER_RESOURCE_GROUP" -n "$IDENTITY_NAME" --query principalId -o tsv)
```

4. Grant the required Azure roles to the managed identity as shown in the following example:

```terminal
export SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account show --query id -o tsv) # Get subscription ID for role assignments

# Required roles for OADP operations
REQUIRED_ROLES=(
    "Contributor"
    "Storage Blob Data Contributor"
    "Disk Snapshot Contributor"
)

for role in "${REQUIRED_ROLES[@]}"; do
    echo "Assigning role: $role"
    az role assignment create \
        --assignee "$IDENTITY_PRINCIPAL_ID" \
        --role "$role" \
        --scope "/subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
done
```

5. Create an Azure storage account and a container as shown in the following example:

```terminal
az storage account create \ # Create storage account
    --name "$STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME" \
    --resource-group "$CLUSTER_RESOURCE_GROUP" \
    --location "$(az group show -n $CLUSTER_RESOURCE_GROUP --query location -o tsv)" \
    --sku Standard_LRS \
    --kind StorageV2
```

6. Get the OIDC issuer URL from your OpenShift cluster as shown in the following example:

```terminal
export SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ISSUER=$(oc get authentication.config.openshift.io cluster -o json | jq -r .spec.serviceAccountIssuer)
echo "OIDC Issuer: $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ISSUER"
```

7. Configure Microsoft Entra Workload ID Federation as shown in the following example:

```terminal
az identity federated-credential create \ # Create federated identity credential for Velero service account
    --name "velero-federated-credential" \
    --identity-name "$IDENTITY_NAME" \
    --resource-group "$CLUSTER_RESOURCE_GROUP" \
    --issuer "$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ISSUER" \
    --subject "system:serviceaccount:openshift-adp:velero" \
    --audiences "openshift"

# Create federated identity credential for OADP controller manager
az identity federated-credential create \
    --name "oadp-controller-federated-credential" \
    --identity-name "$IDENTITY_NAME" \
    --resource-group "$CLUSTER_RESOURCE_GROUP" \
    --issuer "$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ISSUER" \
    --subject "system:serviceaccount:openshift-adp:openshift-adp-controller-manager" \
    --audiences "openshift"
```

8. Create the OADP namespace if it does not already exist by running the following command:

```terminal
oc create namespace openshift-adp
```

9. To use the CloudStorage CR to create an Azure cloud storage resource, run the following command:

```terminal
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: CloudStorage
metadata:
  name: azure-backup-storage
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  name: ${CONTAINER_NAME}
  provider: azure
  creationSecret:
    name: cloud-credentials-azure
    key: azurekey
  config:
    storageAccount: ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME}
EOF
```

10. Create the DataProtectionApplication (DPA) custom resource (CR) and configure the Azure STS details as shown in the following example:

```terminal
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
metadata:
  name: dpa-azure-workload-id-cloudstorage
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  backupLocations:
  - bucket:
      cloudStorageRef:
        name: <cloud_storage_cr>
      config:
        storageAccount: <storage_account_name>
        useAAD: "true"
      credential:
        key: azurekey
        name: cloud-credentials-azure
      default: true
      prefix: velero
    name: default
  configuration:
    velero:
      defaultPlugins:
      - azure
      - openshift
      - csi
      disableFsBackup: false
  logFormat: text
  snapshotLocations:
  - name: default
    velero:
      config:
        resourceGroup: <resource_group>
        subscriptionId: <subscription_ID>
      credential:
        key: azurekey
        name: cloud-credentials-azure
      provider: azure
EOF
```


where:
<cloud_storage_cr>:: Specify the CloudStorage CR name.
<storage_account_name>:: Specify the Azure storage account name.
<resource_group>:: Specify the resource group.
<subscription_ID>:: Specify the subscription ID.

1. Verify that the OADP operator pods are running:

```terminal
$ oc get pods -n openshift-adp
```

2. Verify the Azure role assignments:

```terminal
az role assignment list --assignee ${IDENTITY_PRINCIPAL_ID} --all --query "[].roleDefinitionName" -o tsv
```

3. Verify Microsoft Entra Workload ID authentication:

```terminal
$ VELERO_POD=$(oc get pods -n openshift-adp -l app.kubernetes.io/name=velero -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') # Check Velero pod environment variables

# Check AZURE_CLIENT_ID environment variable
$ oc get pod ${VELERO_POD} -n openshift-adp -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[0].env[?(@.name=="AZURE_CLIENT_ID")]}'

# Check AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE environment variable
$ oc get pod ${VELERO_POD} -n openshift-adp -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[0].env[?(@.name=="AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE")]}'
```

4. Create a backup of an application and verify the backup is stored successfully in Azure storage.

# Setting Velero CPU and memory resource allocations

You set the CPU and memory resource allocations for the Velero pod by editing the  DataProtectionApplication custom resource (CR) manifest.

* You must have the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Operator installed.

* Edit the values in the spec.configuration.velero.podConfig.ResourceAllocations block of the DataProtectionApplication CR manifest, as in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
metadata:
  name: <dpa_sample>
spec:
# ...
  configuration:
    velero:
      podConfig:
        nodeSelector: <node_selector> 1
        resourceAllocations: 2
          limits:
            cpu: "1"
            memory: 1024Mi
          requests:
            cpu: 200m
            memory: 256Mi
```

Specify the node selector to be supplied to Velero podSpec.
The resourceAllocations listed are for average usage.

[NOTE]
----
Kopia is an option in OADP 1.3 and later releases. You can use Kopia for file system backups, and Kopia is your only option for Data Mover cases with the built-in Data Mover.
Kopia is more resource intensive than Restic, and you might need to adjust the CPU and memory requirements accordingly.
----

Use the nodeSelector field to select which nodes can run the node agent. The nodeSelector field is the simplest recommended form of node selection constraint. Any label specified must match the labels on each node.

For more details, see Configuring node agents and node labels.

# Enabling self-signed CA certificates

You must enable a self-signed CA certificate for object storage by editing the DataProtectionApplication custom resource (CR) manifest to prevent a certificate signed by unknown authority error.

* You must have the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Operator installed.

* Edit the spec.backupLocations.velero.objectStorage.caCert parameter and spec.backupLocations.velero.config parameters of the DataProtectionApplication CR manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
metadata:
  name: <dpa_sample>
spec:
# ...
  backupLocations:
    - name: default
      velero:
        provider: aws
        default: true
        objectStorage:
          bucket: <bucket>
          prefix: <prefix>
          caCert: <base64_encoded_cert_string> 1
        config:
          insecureSkipTLSVerify: "false" 2
# ...
```

Specify the Base64-encoded CA certificate string.
The insecureSkipTLSVerify configuration can be set to either "true" or "false". If set to "true", SSL/TLS security is disabled. If set to "false", SSL/TLS security is enabled.

## Using CA certificates with the velero command aliased for Velero deployment

You might want to use the Velero CLI without installing it locally on your system by creating an alias for it.

* You must be logged in to the OpenShift Container Platform cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You must have the OpenShift CLI (oc) installed.
.Procedure
1. To use an aliased Velero command, run the following command:

```terminal
$ alias velero='oc -n openshift-adp exec deployment/velero -c velero -it -- ./velero'
```

2. Check that the alias is working by running the following command:

```terminal
$ velero version
```


```terminal
Client:
	Version: v1.12.1-OADP
	Git commit: -
Server:
	Version: v1.12.1-OADP
```

3. To use a CA certificate with this command, you can add a certificate to the Velero deployment by running the following commands:

```terminal
$ CA_CERT=$(oc -n openshift-adp get dataprotectionapplications.oadp.openshift.io <dpa-name> -o jsonpath='{.spec.backupLocations[0].velero.objectStorage.caCert}')
```


```terminal
$ [[ -n $CA_CERT ]] && echo "$CA_CERT" | base64 -d | oc exec -n openshift-adp -i deploy/velero -c velero -- bash -c "cat > /tmp/your-cacert.txt" || echo "DPA BSL has no caCert"
```


```terminal
$ velero describe backup <backup_name> --details --cacert /tmp/<your_cacert>.txt
```

4. To fetch the backup logs, run the following command:

```terminal
$ velero backup logs  <backup_name>  --cacert /tmp/<your_cacert.txt>
```


You can use these logs to view failures and warnings for the resources that you cannot back up.
5. If the Velero pod restarts, the /tmp/your-cacert.txt file disappears, and you must re-create the /tmp/your-cacert.txt file by re-running the commands from the previous step.
6. You can check if the /tmp/your-cacert.txt file still exists, in the file location where you stored it, by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc exec -n openshift-adp -i deploy/velero -c velero -- bash -c "ls /tmp/your-cacert.txt"
/tmp/your-cacert.txt
```


In a future release of OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP), we plan to mount the certificate to the Velero pod so that this step is not required.

# Installing the Data Protection Application

You install the Data Protection Application (DPA) by creating an instance of the DataProtectionApplication API.

* You must install the OADP Operator.
* You must configure object storage as a backup location.
* If you use snapshots to back up PVs, your cloud provider must support either a native snapshot API or Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots.
* If the backup and snapshot locations use the same credentials, you must create a Secret with the default name, cloud-credentials-azure.
* If the backup and snapshot locations use different credentials, you must create two Secrets:
* Secret with a custom name for the backup location. You add this Secret to the DataProtectionApplication CR.
* Secret with another custom name for the snapshot location. You add this Secret to the DataProtectionApplication CR.

[NOTE]
----
If you do not want to specify backup or snapshot locations during the installation, you can create a default Secret with an empty credentials-velero file. If there is no default Secret, the installation will fail.
----

1. Click Operators -> Installed Operators and select the OADP Operator.
2. Under Provided APIs, click Create instance in the DataProtectionApplication box.
3. Click YAML View and update the parameters of the DataProtectionApplication manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication

          storageAccount: <azure_storage_account_id> 9
          subscriptionId: <azure_subscription_id> 10
        credential:
          key: cloud
          name: cloud-credentials-azure  11
        provider: azure
        default: true
        objectStorage:
          bucket: <bucket_name> 12
          prefix: <prefix> 13
  snapshotLocations: 14
    - velero:
        config:
          resourceGroup: <azure_resource_group>
          subscriptionId: <azure_subscription_id>
          incremental: "true"
        name: default
        provider: azure
        credential:
          key: cloud
          name: cloud-credentials-azure 15
```

The default namespace for OADP is openshift-adp. The namespace is a variable and is configurable.
The openshift plugin is mandatory.
Specify how many minutes to wait for several Velero resources before timeout occurs, such as Velero CRD availability, volumeSnapshot deletion, and backup repository availability. The default is 10m.
The administrative agent that routes the administrative requests to servers.
Set this value to true if you want to enable nodeAgent and perform File System Backup.
Enter kopia or restic as your uploader. You cannot change the selection after the installation. For the Built-in DataMover you must use Kopia. The nodeAgent deploys a daemon set, which means that the nodeAgent pods run on each working node. You can configure File System Backup by adding spec.defaultVolumesToFsBackup: true to the Backup CR.
Specify the nodes on which Kopia or Restic are available. By default, Kopia or Restic run on all nodes.
Specify the Azure resource group.
Specify the Azure storage account ID.
Specify the Azure subscription ID.
If you do not specify this value, the default name, cloud-credentials-azure, is used. If you specify a custom name, the custom name is used for the backup location.
Specify a bucket as the backup storage location. If the bucket is not a dedicated bucket for Velero backups, you must specify a prefix.
Specify a prefix for Velero backups, for example, velero, if the bucket is used for multiple purposes.
You do not need to specify a snapshot location if you use CSI snapshots or Restic to back up PVs.
Specify the name of the Secret object that you created. If you do not specify this value, the default name, cloud-credentials-azure, is used. If you specify a custom name, the custom name is used for the backup location.
4. Click Create.

1. Verify the installation by viewing the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) resources by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get all -n openshift-adp
```

2. Verify that the DataProtectionApplication (DPA) is reconciled by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get dpa dpa-sample -n openshift-adp -o jsonpath='{.status}'
```

Example output

```yaml
{"conditions":[{"lastTransitionTime":"2023-10-27T01:23:57Z","message":"Reconcile complete","reason":"Complete","status":"True","type":"Reconciled"}]}
```

3. Verify the type is set to Reconciled.
4. Verify the backup storage location and confirm that the PHASE is Available by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get backupstoragelocations.velero.io -n openshift-adp
```

Example output

```yaml
NAME           PHASE       LAST VALIDATED   AGE     DEFAULT

```


# Configuring the DPA with client burst and QPS settings

The burst setting determines how many requests can be sent to the velero server before the limit is applied. After the burst limit is reached, the queries per second (QPS) setting determines how many additional requests can be sent per second.

You can set the burst and QPS values of the velero server by configuring the Data Protection Application (DPA) with the burst and QPS values. You can use the dpa.configuration.velero.client-burst and dpa.configuration.velero.client-qps fields of the DPA to set the burst and QPS values.

* You have installed the OADP Operator.

* Configure the client-burst and the client-qps fields in the DPA as shown in the following example:
Example Data Protection Application

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
metadata:
  name: test-dpa
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  backupLocations:
    - name: default
      velero:
        config:
          insecureSkipTLSVerify: "true"
          profile: "default"
          region: <bucket_region>
          s3ForcePathStyle: "true"
          s3Url: <bucket_url>
        credential:
          key: cloud
          name: cloud-credentials
        default: true
        objectStorage:
          bucket: <bucket_name>
          prefix: velero
        provider: aws
  configuration:
    nodeAgent:
      enable: true
      uploaderType: restic
    velero:
      client-burst: 500 1
      client-qps: 300 2
      defaultPlugins:
        - openshift
        - aws
        - kubevirt
```

Specify the client-burst value. In this example, the client-burst field is set to 500.
Specify the client-qps value. In this example, the client-qps field is set to 300.

# Configuring node agents and node labels

The Data Protection Application (DPA) uses the nodeSelector field to select which nodes can run the node agent. The nodeSelector field is the recommended form of node selection constraint.

1. Run the node agent on any node that you choose by adding a custom label:

```terminal
$ oc label node/<node_name> node-role.kubernetes.io/nodeAgent=""
```


[NOTE]
----
Any label specified must match the labels on each node.
----
2. Use the same custom label in the DPA.spec.configuration.nodeAgent.podConfig.nodeSelector field, which you used for labeling nodes:

```terminal
configuration:
  nodeAgent:
    enable: true
    podConfig:
      nodeSelector:
        node-role.kubernetes.io/nodeAgent: ""
```


The following example is an anti-pattern of nodeSelector and does not work unless both labels, node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: "" and node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: "", are on the node:

```terminal
    configuration:
      nodeAgent:
        enable: true
        podConfig:
          nodeSelector:
            node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: ""
            node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ""
```


# Configuring node agent load affinity

You can schedule the node agent pods on specific nodes by using the spec.podConfig.nodeSelector object of the DataProtectionApplication (DPA) custom resource (CR).

See the following example in which you can schedule the node agent pods on nodes with the label label.io/role: cpu-1 and other-label.io/other-role: cpu-2.


```yaml
...
spec:
  configuration:
    nodeAgent:
      enable: true
      uploaderType: kopia
      podConfig:
        nodeSelector:
          label.io/role: cpu-1
          other-label.io/other-role: cpu-2
        ...
```


You can add more restrictions on the node agent pods scheduling by using the nodeagent.loadAffinity object in the DPA spec.

* You must be logged in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* You have installed the OADP Operator.
* You have configured the DPA CR.

* Configure the DPA spec nodegent.loadAffinity object as shown in the following example.

In the example, you ensure that the node agent pods are scheduled only on nodes with the label label.io/role: cpu-1 and the label label.io/hostname matching with either node1 or node2.

```yaml
...
spec:
  configuration:
    nodeAgent:
      enable: true
      loadAffinity: 1
        - nodeSelector:
            matchLabels:
              label.io/role: cpu-1
            matchExpressions: 2
              - key: label.io/hostname
                operator: In
                values:
                  - node1
                  - node2
                  ...
```

Configure the loadAffinity object by adding the matchLabels and matchExpressions objects.
Configure the matchExpressions object to add restrictions on the node agent pods scheduling.

# Node agent load affinity guidelines

Use the following guidelines to configure the node agent loadAffinity object in the DataProtectionApplication (DPA) custom resource (CR).

* Use the spec.nodeagent.podConfig.nodeSelector object for simple node matching.
* Use the loadAffinity.nodeSelector object without the podConfig.nodeSelector object for more complex scenarios.
* You can use both podConfig.nodeSelector and loadAffinity.nodeSelector objects, but the loadAffinity object must be equal or more restrictive as compared to the podConfig object. In this scenario, the podConfig.nodeSelector labels must be a subset of the labels used in the loadAffinity.nodeSelector object.
* You cannot use the matchExpressions and matchLabels fields if you have configured both podConfig.nodeSelector and loadAffinity.nodeSelector objects in the DPA.
* See the following example to configure both podConfig.nodeSelector and loadAffinity.nodeSelector objects in the DPA.

```yaml
...
spec:
  configuration:
    nodeAgent:
      enable: true
      uploaderType: kopia
      loadAffinity:
        - nodeSelector:
            matchLabels:
              label.io/location: 'US'
              label.io/gpu: 'no'
      podConfig:
        nodeSelector:
          label.io/gpu: 'no'
```


# Configuring node agent load concurrency

You can control the maximum number of node agent operations that can run simultaneously on each node within your cluster.

You can configure it using one of the following fields of the Data Protection Application (DPA):

* globalConfig: Defines a default concurrency limit for the node agent across all nodes.
* perNodeConfig: Specifies different concurrency limits for specific nodes based on nodeSelector labels. This provides flexibility for environments where certain nodes might have different resource capacities or roles.

* You must be logged in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

1. If you want to use load concurrency for specific nodes, add labels to those nodes:

```terminal
$ oc label node/<node_name> label.io/instance-type='large'
```

2. Configure the load concurrency fields for your DPA instance:

```yaml
  configuration:
    nodeAgent:
      enable: true
      uploaderType: kopia
      loadConcurrency:
        globalConfig: 1 1
        perNodeConfig:
        - nodeSelector:
              matchLabels:
                 label.io/instance-type: large 2
          number: 3 3
```

Global concurrent number. The default value is 1, which means there is no concurrency and only one load is allowed. The globalConfig value does not have a limit.
Label for per-node concurrency.
Per-node concurrent number. You can specify many per-node concurrent numbers, for example, based on the instance type and size. The range of per-node concurrent number is the same as the global concurrent number. If the configuration file contains a per-node concurrent number and a global concurrent number, the per-node concurrent number takes precedence.

# Configuring the node agent as a non-root and non-privileged user

To enhance the node agent security, you can configure the OADP Operator node agent daemonset to run as a non-root and non-privileged user by using the spec.configuration.velero.disableFsBackup setting in the DataProtectionApplication (DPA) custom resource (CR).

By setting the spec.configuration.velero.disableFsBackup setting to true, the node agent security context sets the root file system to read-only and sets the privileged flag to false.


[NOTE]
----
Setting spec.configuration.velero.disableFsBackup to true enhances the node agent security by removing the need for privileged containers and enforcing a read-only root file system.
However, it also disables File System Backup (FSB) with Kopia. If your workloads rely on FSB for backing up volumes that do not support native snapshots, then you should evaluate whether the disableFsBackup configuration fits your use case.
----

* You have installed the OADP Operator.

* Configure the disableFsBackup field in the DPA as shown in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
metadata:
  name: ts-dpa
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  backupLocations:
  - velero:
      credential:
        key: cloud
        name: cloud-credentials
      default: true
      objectStorage:
        bucket: <bucket_name>
        prefix: velero
      provider: gcp
  configuration:
    nodeAgent: 1
      enable: true
      uploaderType: kopia
    velero:
      defaultPlugins:
      - csi
      - gcp
      - openshift
      disableFsBackup: true 2
```

Enable the node agent in the DPA.
Set the disableFsBackup field to true.

1. Verify that the node agent security context is set to run as non-root and the root file system is readOnly by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get daemonset node-agent -o yaml
```


The example output is as following:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  ...
  name: node-agent
  namespace: openshift-adp
  ...
spec:
  ...
  template:
    metadata:
      ...
    spec:
      containers:
      ...
        securityContext:
          allowPrivilegeEscalation: false 1
          capabilities:
            drop:
            - ALL
          privileged: false 2
          readOnlyRootFilesystem: true 3
        ...
      nodeSelector:
        kubernetes.io/os: linux
      os:
        name: linux
      restartPolicy: Always
      schedulerName: default-scheduler
      securityContext:
        runAsNonRoot: true 4
        seccompProfile:
          type: RuntimeDefault
      serviceAccount: velero
      serviceAccountName: velero
      ....
```

The allowPrivilegeEscalation field is false.
The privileged field is false.
The root file system is read-only.
The node agent is run as a non-root user.

# Configuring repository maintenance

OADP repository maintenance is a background job, you can configure it independently of the node agent pods. This means that you can schedule the repository maintenance pod on a node where the node agent is or is not running.

You can use the repository maintenance job affinity configurations in the DataProtectionApplication (DPA) custom resource (CR) only if you use Kopia as the backup repository.

You have the option to configure the load affinity at the global level affecting all repositories. Or you can configure the load affinity for each repository. You can also use a combination of global and per-repository configuration.

* You must be logged in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* You have installed the OADP Operator.
* You have configured the DPA CR.

* Configure the loadAffinity object in the DPA spec by using either one or both of the following methods:
* Global configuration: Configure load affinity for all repositories as shown in the following example:

```yaml
...
spec:
  configuration:
    repositoryMaintenance: 1
      global: 2
        podResources:
          cpuRequest: "100m"
          cpuLimit: "200m"
          memoryRequest: "100Mi"
          memoryLimit: "200Mi"
        loadAffinity:
          - nodeSelector:
              matchLabels:
                label.io/gpu: 'no'
              matchExpressions:
                - key: label.io/location
                  operator: In
                  values:
                    - US
                    - EU
```

Configure the repositoryMaintenance object as shown in the example.
Use the global object to configure load affinity for all repositories.
* Per-repository configuration: Configure load affinity per repository as shown in the following example:

```yaml
...
spec:
  configuration:
    repositoryMaintenance:
      myrepositoryname: 1
        loadAffinity:
          - nodeSelector:
              matchLabels:
                label.io/cpu: 'yes'
```

Configure the repositoryMaintenance object for each repository.

# Configuring Velero load affinity

With each OADP deployment, there is one Velero pod and its main purpose is to schedule Velero workloads. To schedule the Velero pod, you can use the velero.podConfig.nodeSelector and the velero.loadAffinity objects in the DataProtectionApplication (DPA) custom resource (CR) spec.

Use the podConfig.nodeSelector object to assign the Velero pod to specific nodes. You can also configure the velero.loadAffinity object for pod-level affinity and anti-affinity.

The OpenShift scheduler applies the rules and performs the scheduling of the Velero pod deployment.

* You must be logged in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* You have installed the OADP Operator.
* You have configured the DPA CR.

* Configure the velero.podConfig.nodeSelector and the velero.loadAffinity objects in the DPA spec as shown in the following examples:
* velero.podConfig.nodeSelector object configuration:

```yaml
...
spec:
  configuration:
    velero:
      podConfig:
        nodeSelector:
          some-label.io/custom-node-role: backup-core
```

* velero.loadAffinity object configuration:

```yaml
...
spec:
  configuration:
    velero:
      loadAffinity:
        - nodeSelector:
            matchLabels:
              label.io/gpu: 'no'
            matchExpressions:
              - key: label.io/location
                operator: In
                values:
                  - US
                  - EU
```


# Overriding the imagePullPolicy setting in the DPA

In OADP 1.4.0 or earlier, the Operator sets the imagePullPolicy field of the Velero and node agent pods to Always for all images.

In OADP 1.4.1 or later, the Operator first checks if each image has the sha256 or sha512 digest and sets the imagePullPolicy field accordingly:

* If the image has the digest, the Operator sets imagePullPolicy to IfNotPresent.
* If the image does not have the digest, the Operator sets imagePullPolicy to Always.

You can also override the imagePullPolicy field by using the spec.imagePullPolicy field in the Data Protection Application (DPA).

* You have installed the OADP Operator.

* Configure the spec.imagePullPolicy field in the DPA as shown in the following example:
Example Data Protection Application

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
metadata:
  name: test-dpa
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  backupLocations:
    - name: default
      velero:
        config:
          insecureSkipTLSVerify: "true"
          profile: "default"
          region: <bucket_region>
          s3ForcePathStyle: "true"
          s3Url: <bucket_url>
        credential:
          key: cloud
          name: cloud-credentials
        default: true
        objectStorage:
          bucket: <bucket_name>
          prefix: velero
        provider: aws
  configuration:
    nodeAgent:
      enable: true
      uploaderType: kopia
    velero:
      defaultPlugins:
        - openshift
        - aws
        - kubevirt
        - csi
  imagePullPolicy: Never 1
```

Specify the value for imagePullPolicy. In this example, the imagePullPolicy field is set to Never.

## Enabling CSI in the DataProtectionApplication CR

You enable the Container Storage Interface (CSI) in the DataProtectionApplication custom resource (CR) in order to back up persistent volumes with CSI snapshots.

* The cloud provider must support CSI snapshots.

* Edit the DataProtectionApplication CR, as in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
...
spec:
  configuration:
    velero:
      defaultPlugins:
      - openshift
      - csi 1
```

Add the csi default plugin.

## Disabling the node agent in DataProtectionApplication

If you are not using Restic, Kopia, or DataMover for your backups, you can disable the nodeAgent field in the DataProtectionApplication custom resource (CR). Before you disable nodeAgent, ensure the OADP Operator is idle and not running any backups.

1. To disable the nodeAgent, set the enable flag to false. See the following example:
Example DataProtectionApplication CR

```yaml
# ...
configuration:
  nodeAgent:
    enable: false  1
    uploaderType: kopia
# ...
```

Disables the node agent.
2. To enable the nodeAgent, set the enable flag to true. See the following example:
Example DataProtectionApplication CR

```yaml
# ...
configuration:
  nodeAgent:
    enable: true  1
    uploaderType: kopia
# ...
```

Enables the node agent.

You can set up a job to enable and disable the nodeAgent field in the DataProtectionApplication CR. For more information, see "Running tasks in pods using jobs".

* Installing the Data Protection Application with the kubevirt and openshift plugins
* Running tasks in pods using jobs.
* Configuring the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) with multiple backup storage locations
