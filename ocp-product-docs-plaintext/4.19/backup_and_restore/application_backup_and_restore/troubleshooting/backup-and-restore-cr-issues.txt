# Backup and Restore CR issues


You might encounter the following common issues with Backup and Restore custom resources (CRs):
* Backup CR cannot retrieve volume
* Backup CR status remains in progress
* Backup CR status remains in the PartiallyFailed phase/state/etc

# Troubleshooting issue where backup CR cannot retrieve volume

If the persistent volume (PV) and the snapshot locations are in different regions, the Backup custom resource (CR) displays the following error message:


```text
InvalidVolume.NotFound: The volume ‘vol-xxxx’ does not exist.
```


1. Edit the value of the spec.snapshotLocations.velero.config.region key in the DataProtectionApplication manifest so that the snapshot location is in the same region as the PV.
2. Create a new Backup CR.

# Troubleshooting issue where backup CR status remains in progress

If a backup is interrupted, it cannot be resumed, and the status of a Backup customer resource (CR) remains in the InProgress phase and does not complete.

1. Retrieve the details of the Backup CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n {namespace} exec deployment/velero -c velero -- ./velero \
  backup describe <backup>
```

2. Delete the Backup CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete backups.velero.io <backup> -n openshift-adp
```


You do not need to clean up the backup location because an in progress Backup CR has not uploaded files to object storage.
3. Create a new Backup CR.
4. View the Velero backup details by running the following command:

```terminal
$ velero backup describe <backup_name> --details
```


# Troubleshooting issue where backup CR status remains partially failed

The status of a Backup CR without Restic in use remains in the PartiallyFailed phase and is not completed. A snapshot of the affiliated PVC is not created.

If the backup created based on the CSI snapshot class is missing a label, the CSI snapshot plugin fails to create a snapshot. As a result, the Velero pod logs an error similar to the following message:


```text
time="2023-02-17T16:33:13Z" level=error msg="Error backing up item" backup=openshift-adp/user1-backup-check5 error="error executing custom action (groupResource=persistentvolumeclaims, namespace=busy1, name=pvc1-user1): rpc error: code = Unknown desc = failed to get volumesnapshotclass for storageclass ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd: failed to get volumesnapshotclass for provisioner openshift-storage.rbd.csi.ceph.com, ensure that the desired volumesnapshot class has the velero.io/csi-volumesnapshot-class label" logSource="/remote-source/velero/app/pkg/backup/backup.go:417" name=busybox-79799557b5-vprq
```


1. Delete the Backup CR by running the following command::

```terminal
$ oc delete backups.velero.io <backup> -n openshift-adp
```

2. If required, clean up the stored data on the BackupStorageLocation resource  to free up space.
3. Apply the velero.io/csi-volumesnapshot-class=true label to the VolumeSnapshotClass object by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc label volumesnapshotclass/<snapclass_name> velero.io/csi-volumesnapshot-class=true
```

4. Create a new Backup CR.
