# Using the must-gather tool


You can collect logs and information about OADP custom resources by using the must-gather tool. The must-gather data must be attached to all customer cases.
The must-gather tool is a container and does not run all the time. The tool runs for a few minutes only after you invoke the tool by running the must-gather command.

# Using the must-gather tool

You can run the must-gather tool with the following options. To use an option, add a flag corresponding to that option in the must-gather command.

Default configuration:: This configuration collects pod logs, OADP, and Velero custom resource (CR) information for all namespaces where the OADP Operator is installed.
Timeout:: Data collection can take a long time if there are many failed Backup CRs. You can improve performance by setting a timeout value.
Insecure TLS connections:: If a custom CA certificate is used, use the must-gather tool with insecure TLS connections.

The must-gather tool generates a Markdown output file with the collected information. The Markdown file is located in a cluster directory.

For more information about the supported flags, use the help flag with the must-gather tool as shown in the following example:


```terminal
$ oc adm must-gather --image={must-gather-v1-5} -- /usr/bin/gather -h
```


* You have logged in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the must-gather data.
2. Run the oc adm must-gather command for one of the following data collection options:
* To use the default configuration of the must-gather tool, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc adm must-gather --image=registry.redhat.io/oadp/oadp-mustgather-rhel9:v1.5
```

* To use the timeout flag with the must-gather tool, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc adm must-gather --image=registry.redhat.io/oadp/oadp-mustgather-rhel9:v1.5 -- /usr/bin/gather --request-timeout 1m 1
```

In this example, the timeout is 1 minute.
* To use the insecure TLS connection flag with the must-gather tool, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc adm must-gather --image=registry.redhat.io/oadp/oadp-mustgather-rhel9:v1.5 -- /usr/bin/gather --skip-tls
```

* To use a combination of the insecure TLS connection and the timeout flags with the must-gather tool, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc adm must-gather --image=registry.redhat.io/oadp/oadp-mustgather-rhel9:v1.5 -- /usr/bin/gather --request-timeout 15s --skip-tls 1
```

In this example, the timeout is 15 seconds. By default, the --skip-tls flag value is false. Set the value to true to allow insecure TLS connections.

1. Verify that the Markdown output file is generated at the following location: must-gather.local.89&#8230;&#8203;054550/registry.redhat.io/oadp/oadp-mustgather-rhel9:v1.5-sha256-0&#8230;&#8203;84/clusters/a4&#8230;&#8203;86/oadp-must-gather-summary.md
2. Review the must-gather data in the Markdown file by opening the file in a Markdown previewer. For an example output, refer to the following image. You can upload this output file to a support case on the Red Hat Customer Portal.
