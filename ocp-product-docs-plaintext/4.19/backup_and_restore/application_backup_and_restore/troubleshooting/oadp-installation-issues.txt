# OADP installation issues


You might encounter issues caused by using invalid directories or incorrect credentials when you install the Data Protection Application (DPA).

# Resolving invalid directories in backup storage

The object storage contains top-level directories that are not Velero directories. The Velero pod log displays the following error message:


```text
Backup storage contains invalid top-level directories.
```


* If the object storage is not dedicated to Velero, you must specify a prefix for the bucket by setting the spec.backupLocations.velero.objectStorage.prefix parameter in the DataProtectionApplication manifest.

# Resolving incorrect AWS credentials

If the credentials-velero file that is used to create the Secret object is incorrectly formatted, multiple errors might occur, including the following examples:

* The oadp-aws-registry pod log displays the following error message:

```text
`InvalidAccessKeyId: The AWS Access Key Id you provided does not exist in our records.`
```

* The Velero pod log displays the following error message:

```text
NoCredentialProviders: no valid providers in chain.
```


* Ensure that the credentials-velero file is correctly formatted, as shown in the following example:
Example credentials-velero file

```
[default] 1
aws_access_key_id=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE 2
aws_secret_access_key=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
```
