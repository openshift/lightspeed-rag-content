# Pods crash or restart due to lack of memory or CPU

If a Velero or Restic pod crashes due to a lack of memory or CPU, you can set specific resource requests for either of those resources. The values for the resource request fields must follow the same format as Kubernetes resource requirements.
If you do not specify configuration.velero.podConfig.resourceAllocations or configuration.restic.podConfig.resourceAllocations, see the following default resources specification configuration for a Velero or Restic pod:

```yaml
requests:
  cpu: 500m
  memory: 128Mi
```

* Velero CPU and memory requirements based on collected data

# Setting resource requests for a Velero pod

You can use the configuration.velero.podConfig.resourceAllocations specification field in the oadp_v1alpha1_dpa.yaml file to set specific resource requests for a Velero pod.

* Set the cpu and memory resource requests in the YAML file:
Example Velero file

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
...
configuration:
  velero:
    podConfig:
      resourceAllocations: 1
        requests:
          cpu: 200m
          memory: 256Mi
```

The resourceAllocations listed are for average usage.

# Setting resource requests for a Restic pod

You can use the configuration.restic.podConfig.resourceAllocations specification field to set specific resource requests for a Restic pod.


[NOTE]
----
With OADP 1.5.0, the configuration.restic.podConfig.resourceAllocations specification field is removed from Data Protection Application (DPA). Use the nodeAgent section with the uploaderType field set to Kopia instead of Restic .
----

* Set the cpu and memory resource requests in the YAML file:
Example Restic file

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
...
configuration:
  restic:
    podConfig:
      resourceAllocations: 1
        requests:
          cpu: 1000m
          memory: 16Gi
```

The resourceAllocations listed are for average usage.

# Setting resource requests for a nodeAgent pod

You can use the configuration.nodeAgent.podConfig.resourceAllocations specification field to set specific resource requests for a nodeAgent pod.


[NOTE]
----
With OADP 1.5.0, the configuration.restic.podConfig.resourceAllocations specification field is removed from Data Protection Application (DPA). Use the nodeAgent section with the uploaderType field set to Kopia instead of Restic .
----

1. Set the cpu and memory resource requests in the YAML file:
Example nodeAgent.yaml file

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
metadata:
  name: ts-dpa
spec:
  backupLocations:
  - velero:
      default: true
      objectStorage:
        bucket: oadp.....njph
        prefix: velero
      credential:
        key: cloud
        name: cloud-credentials-gcp
      provider: gcp
  configuration:
    velero:
      defaultPlugins:
      - gcp
      - openshift
      - csi
    nodeAgent:
      enable: true
      uploaderType: kopia
      podConfig:
        resourceAllocations: 1
          requests:
            cpu: 1000m
            memory: 16Gi 2
```

The resource allocation examples shown are for average usage.
You can modify this parameter depending on your infrastructure and usage.
2. Create the DPA CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f nodeAgent.yaml
```


1. Verify that the nodeAgent pods are running by using the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get pods
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                                                        READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
node-agent-hbj9l                                            1/1     Running     0          97s
node-agent-wmwgz                                            1/1     Running     0          95s
node-agent-zvc7k                                            1/1     Running     0          98s
openshift-adp-controller-manager-7f9db86d96-4lhgq           1/1     Running     0          137m
velero-7b6c7fb8d7-ppc8m                                     1/1     Running     0          4m2s
```

2. Check the resource requests by describing one of the nodeAgent pod:

```terminal
$ oc describe pod node-agent-hbj9l | grep -C 5 Requests
```

Example output

```terminal
      --log-format=text
    State:          Running
      Started:      Mon, 09 Jun 2025 16:22:15 +0530
    Ready:          True
    Restart Count:  0
    Requests:
      cpu:     1
      memory:  1Gi
    Environment:
      NODE_NAME:            (v1:spec.nodeName)
      VELERO_NAMESPACE:    openshift-adp (v1:metadata.namespace)
```
