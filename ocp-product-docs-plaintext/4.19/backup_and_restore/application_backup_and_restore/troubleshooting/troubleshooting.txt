# Troubleshooting

You can troubleshoot OADP issues by using the following methods:

* Debug Velero custom resources (CRs) by using the OpenShift CLI tool or the Velero CLI tool. The Velero CLI tool provides more detailed logs and information.
* Debug Velero or Restic pod crashes, which are caused due to a lack of memory or CPU by using Pods crash or restart due to lack of memory or CPU.
* Debug issues with Velero and admission webhooks by using Restoring workarounds for Velero backups that use admission webhooks.
* Check OADP installation issues, OADP Operator issues, backup and restore CR issues, and Restic issues.
* Use the available OADP timeouts to reduce errors, retries, or failures.
* Collect logs and CR information by using the must-gather tool.
* Monitor and analyze the workload performance with the help of OADP monitoring.
