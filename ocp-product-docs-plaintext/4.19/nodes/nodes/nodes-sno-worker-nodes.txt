# Adding worker nodes to single-node OpenShift clusters


Single-node OpenShift clusters reduce the host prerequisites for deployment to a single host. This is useful for deployments in constrained environments or at the network edge. However, sometimes you need to add additional capacity to your cluster, for example, in telecommunications and network edge scenarios. In these scenarios, you can add worker nodes to the single-node cluster.

[NOTE]
----
Unlike multi-node clusters, by default all ingress traffic is routed to the single control-plane node, even after adding additional worker nodes.
----
There are several ways that you can add worker nodes to a single-node cluster. You can add worker nodes to a cluster manually, using Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager, or by using the Assisted Installer REST API directly.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Adding worker nodes does not expand the cluster control plane, and it does not provide high availability to your cluster. For single-node OpenShift clusters, high availability is handled by failing over to another site. When adding worker nodes to single-node OpenShift clusters, a tested maximum of two worker nodes is recommended. Exceeding the recommended number of worker nodes might result in lower overall performance, including cluster failure.
----

[NOTE]
----
To add worker nodes, you must have access to the OpenShift Cluster Manager. This method is not supported when using the Agent-based installer to install a cluster in a disconnected environment.
----

# Requirements for installing single-node OpenShift worker nodes

To install a single-node OpenShift worker node, you must address the following requirements:

* Administration host: You must have a computer to prepare the ISO and to monitor the installation.
* Production-grade server: Installing single-node OpenShift worker nodes requires a server with sufficient resources to run Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform services and a production workload.
Minimum resource requirements


[NOTE]
----
One vCPU is equivalent to one physical core when simultaneous multithreading (SMT), or hyperthreading, is not enabled. When enabled, use the following formula to calculate the corresponding ratio:
(threads per core × cores) × sockets = vCPUs
----

The server must have a Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) when booting with virtual media.
* Networking: The worker node server must have access to the internet or access to a local registry if it is not connected to a routable network. The worker node server must have a DHCP reservation or a static IP address and be able to access the single-node OpenShift cluster Kubernetes API, ingress route, and cluster node domain names. You must configure the DNS to resolve the IP address to each of the following fully qualified domain names (FQDN) for the single-node OpenShift cluster:
Required DNS records


Without persistent IP addresses, communications between the apiserver and etcd might fail.

* Minimum resource requirements for cluster installation
* Recommended practices for scaling the cluster
* User-provisioned DNS requirements
* Creating a bootable ISO image on a USB drive
* Booting from an ISO image served over HTTP using the Redfish API
* Deleting nodes from a cluster

# Adding worker nodes using the Assisted Installer and OpenShift Cluster Manager

You can add worker nodes to single-node OpenShift clusters that were created on Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager using the Assisted Installer.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Adding worker nodes to single-node OpenShift clusters is only supported for clusters running Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.11 and up.
----

* Have access to a single-node OpenShift cluster installed using Assisted Installer.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* Ensure that all the required DNS records exist for the cluster that you are adding the worker node to.

1. Log in to OpenShift Cluster Manager and click the single-node cluster that you want to add a worker node to.
2. Click Add hosts, and download the discovery ISO for the new worker node, adding SSH public key and configuring cluster-wide proxy settings as required.
3. Boot the target host using the discovery ISO, and wait for the host to be discovered in the console. After the host is discovered, start the installation.
4. As the installation proceeds, the installation generates pending certificate signing requests (CSRs) for the worker node. When prompted, approve the pending CSRs to complete the installation.

When the worker node is sucessfully installed, it is listed as a worker node in the cluster web console.


[IMPORTANT]
----
New worker nodes will be encrypted using the same method as the original cluster.

# Adding worker nodes using the Assisted Installer API

You can add worker nodes to single-node OpenShift clusters using the Assisted Installer REST API. Before you add worker nodes, you must log in to OpenShift Cluster Manager and authenticate against the API.

## Authenticating against the Assisted Installer REST API

Before you can use the Assisted Installer REST API, you must authenticate against the API using a JSON web token (JWT) that you generate.

* Log in to OpenShift Cluster Manager as a user with cluster creation privileges.
* Install jq.

1. Log in to OpenShift Cluster Manager and copy your API token.
2. Set the $OFFLINE_TOKEN variable using the copied API token by running the following command:

```terminal
$ export OFFLINE_TOKEN=<copied_api_token>
```

3. Set the $JWT_TOKEN variable using the previously set $OFFLINE_TOKEN variable:

```terminal
$ export JWT_TOKEN=$(
  curl \
  --silent \
  --header "Accept: application/json" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  --data-urlencode "grant_type=refresh_token" \
  --data-urlencode "client_id=cloud-services" \
  --data-urlencode "refresh_token=${OFFLINE_TOKEN}" \
  "https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token" \
  | jq --raw-output ".access_token"
)
```


[NOTE]
----
The JWT token is valid for 15 minutes only.
----

* Optional: Check that you can access the API by running the following command:

```terminal
$ curl -s https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/component-versions -H "Authorization: Bearer ${JWT_TOKEN}" | jq
```

Example output

```yaml
{
    "release_tag": "v2.5.1",
    "versions":
    {
        "assisted-installer": "registry.redhat.io/rhai-tech-preview/assisted-installer-rhel8:v1.0.0-175",
        "assisted-installer-controller": "registry.redhat.io/rhai-tech-preview/assisted-installer-reporter-rhel8:v1.0.0-223",
        "assisted-installer-service": "quay.io/app-sre/assisted-service:ac87f93",
        "discovery-agent": "registry.redhat.io/rhai-tech-preview/assisted-installer-agent-rhel8:v1.0.0-156"
    }
}
```


## Adding worker nodes using the Assisted Installer REST API

You can add worker nodes to clusters using the Assisted Installer REST API.

* Install the OpenShift Cluster Manager CLI (ocm).
* Log in to OpenShift Cluster Manager as a user with cluster creation privileges.
* Install jq.
* Ensure that all the required DNS records exist for the cluster that you are adding the worker node to.

1. Authenticate against the Assisted Installer REST API and generate a JSON web token (JWT) for your session. The generated JWT token is valid for 15 minutes only.
2. Set the $API_URL variable by running the following command:

```terminal
$ export API_URL=<api_url> 1
```

Replace <api_url> with the Assisted Installer API URL, for example, https://api.openshift.com
3. Import the single-node OpenShift cluster by running the following commands:
1. Set the $OPENSHIFT_CLUSTER_ID variable. Log in to the cluster and run the following command:

```terminal
$ export OPENSHIFT_CLUSTER_ID=$(oc get clusterversion -o jsonpath='{.items[].spec.clusterID}')
```

2. Set the $CLUSTER_REQUEST variable that is used to import the cluster:

```terminal
$ export CLUSTER_REQUEST=$(jq --null-input --arg openshift_cluster_id "$OPENSHIFT_CLUSTER_ID" '{
  "api_vip_dnsname": "<api_vip>", 1
  "openshift_cluster_id": $openshift_cluster_id,
  "name": "<openshift_cluster_name>" 2
}')
```

Replace <api_vip> with the hostname for the cluster's API server. This can be the DNS domain for the API server or the IP address of the single node which the worker node can reach. For example, api.compute-1.example.com.
Replace <openshift_cluster_name> with the plain text name for the cluster. The cluster name should match the cluster name that was set during the Day 1 cluster installation.
3. Import the cluster and set the $CLUSTER_ID variable. Run the following command:

```terminal
$ CLUSTER_ID=$(curl "$API_URL/api/assisted-install/v2/clusters/import" -H "Authorization: Bearer ${JWT_TOKEN}" -H 'accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "$CLUSTER_REQUEST" | tee /dev/stderr | jq -r '.id')
```

4. Generate the InfraEnv resource for the cluster and set the $INFRA_ENV_ID variable by running the following commands:
1. Download the pull secret file from Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager at console.redhat.com.
2. Set the $INFRA_ENV_REQUEST variable:

```terminal
export INFRA_ENV_REQUEST=$(jq --null-input \
    --slurpfile pull_secret <path_to_pull_secret_file> \1
    --arg ssh_pub_key "$(cat <path_to_ssh_pub_key>)" \2
    --arg cluster_id "$CLUSTER_ID" '{
  "name": "<infraenv_name>", 3
  "pull_secret": $pull_secret[0] | tojson,
  "cluster_id": $cluster_id,
  "ssh_authorized_key": $ssh_pub_key,
  "image_type": "<iso_image_type>" 4
}')
```

Replace <path_to_pull_secret_file> with the path to the local file containing the downloaded pull secret from Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager at console.redhat.com.
Replace <path_to_ssh_pub_key> with the path to the public SSH key required to access the host. If you do not set this value, you cannot access the host while in discovery mode.
Replace <infraenv_name> with the plain text name for the InfraEnv resource.
Replace <iso_image_type> with the ISO image type, either full-iso or minimal-iso.
3. Post the $INFRA_ENV_REQUEST to the /v2/infra-envs API and set the $INFRA_ENV_ID variable:

```terminal
$ INFRA_ENV_ID=$(curl "$API_URL/api/assisted-install/v2/infra-envs" -H "Authorization: Bearer ${JWT_TOKEN}" -H 'accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d "$INFRA_ENV_REQUEST" | tee /dev/stderr | jq -r '.id')
```

5. Get the URL of the discovery ISO for the cluster worker node by running the following command:

```terminal
$ curl -s "$API_URL/api/assisted-install/v2/infra-envs/$INFRA_ENV_ID" -H "Authorization: Bearer ${JWT_TOKEN}" | jq -r '.download_url'
```

Example output

```terminal
https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-images/images/41b91e72-c33e-42ee-b80f-b5c5bbf6431a?arch=x86_64&image_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjE2NTYwMjYzNzEsInN1YiI6IjQxYjkxZTcyLWMzM2UtNDJlZS1iODBmLWI1YzViYmY2NDMxYSJ9.1EX_VGaMNejMhrAvVRBS7PDPIQtbOOc8LtG8OukE1a4&type=minimal-iso&version=$VERSION
```

6. Download the ISO:

```terminal
$ curl -L -s '<iso_url>' --output rhcos-live-minimal.iso 1
```

Replace <iso_url> with the URL for the ISO from the previous step.
7. Boot the new worker host from the downloaded rhcos-live-minimal.iso.
8. Get the list of hosts in the cluster that are not installed. Keep running the following command until the new host shows up:

```terminal
$ curl -s "$API_URL/api/assisted-install/v2/clusters/$CLUSTER_ID" -H "Authorization: Bearer ${JWT_TOKEN}" | jq -r '.hosts[] | select(.status != "installed").id'
```

Example output

```terminal
2294ba03-c264-4f11-ac08-2f1bb2f8c296
```

9. Set the $HOST_ID variable for the new worker node, for example:

```terminal
$ HOST_ID=<host_id> 1
```

Replace <host_id> with the host ID from the previous step.
10. Check that the host is ready to install by running the following command:

[NOTE]
----
Ensure that you copy the entire command including the complete jq expression.
----

```terminal
$ curl -s $API_URL/api/assisted-install/v2/clusters/$CLUSTER_ID -H "Authorization: Bearer ${JWT_TOKEN}" | jq '
def host_name($host):
    if (.suggested_hostname // "") == "" then
        if (.inventory // "") == "" then
            "Unknown hostname, please wait"
        else
            .inventory | fromjson | .hostname
        end
    else
        .suggested_hostname
    end;

def is_notable($validation):
    ["failure", "pending", "error"] | any(. == $validation.status);

def notable_validations($validations_info):
    [
        $validations_info // "{}"
        | fromjson
        | to_entries[].value[]
        | select(is_notable(.))
    ];

{
    "Hosts validations": {
        "Hosts": [
            .hosts[]
            | select(.status != "installed")
            | {
                "id": .id,
                "name": host_name(.),
                "status": .status,
                "notable_validations": notable_validations(.validations_info)
            }
        ]
    },
    "Cluster validations info": {
        "notable_validations": notable_validations(.validations_info)
    }
}
' -r
```

Example output

```terminal
{
  "Hosts validations": {
    "Hosts": [
      {
        "id": "97ec378c-3568-460c-bc22-df54534ff08f",
        "name": "localhost.localdomain",
        "status": "insufficient",
        "notable_validations": [
          {
            "id": "ntp-synced",
            "status": "failure",
            "message": "Host couldn't synchronize with any NTP server"
          },
          {
            "id": "api-domain-name-resolved-correctly",
            "status": "error",
            "message": "Parse error for domain name resolutions result"
          },
          {
            "id": "api-int-domain-name-resolved-correctly",
            "status": "error",
            "message": "Parse error for domain name resolutions result"
          },
          {
            "id": "apps-domain-name-resolved-correctly",
            "status": "error",
            "message": "Parse error for domain name resolutions result"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "Cluster validations info": {
    "notable_validations": []
  }
}
```

11. When the previous command shows that the host is ready, start the installation using the /v2/infra-envs/{infra_env_id}/hosts/{host_id}/actions/install API by running the following command:

```terminal
$ curl -X POST -s "$API_URL/api/assisted-install/v2/infra-envs/$INFRA_ENV_ID/hosts/$HOST_ID/actions/install"  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${JWT_TOKEN}"
```

12. As the installation proceeds, the installation generates pending certificate signing requests (CSRs) for the worker node.

[IMPORTANT]
----
You must approve the CSRs to complete the installation.
----

Keep running the following API call to monitor the cluster installation:

```terminal
$ curl -s "$API_URL/api/assisted-install/v2/clusters/$CLUSTER_ID" -H "Authorization: Bearer ${JWT_TOKEN}" | jq '{
    "Cluster day-2 hosts":
        [
            .hosts[]
            | select(.status != "installed")
            | {id, requested_hostname, status, status_info, progress, status_updated_at, updated_at, infra_env_id, cluster_id, created_at}
        ]
}'
```

Example output

```terminal
{
  "Cluster day-2 hosts": [
    {
      "id": "a1c52dde-3432-4f59-b2ae-0a530c851480",
      "requested_hostname": "control-plane-1",
      "status": "added-to-existing-cluster",
      "status_info": "Host has rebooted and no further updates will be posted. Please check console for progress and to possibly approve pending CSRs",
      "progress": {

      "created_at": "2022-07-06T22:54:57.161614Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

13. Optional: Run the following command to see all the events for the cluster:

```terminal
$ curl -s "$API_URL/api/assisted-install/v2/events?cluster_id=$CLUSTER_ID" -H "Authorization: Bearer ${JWT_TOKEN}" | jq -c '.[] | {severity, message, event_time, host_id}'
```

Example output

```terminal
{"severity":"info","message":"Host compute-0: updated status from insufficient to known (Host is ready to be installed)","event_time":"2022-07-08T11:21:46.346Z","host_id":"9d7b3b44-1125-4ad0-9b14-76550087b445"}

14. Log in to the cluster and approve the pending CSRs to complete the installation.

* Check that the new worker node was successfully added to the cluster with a status of Ready:

```terminal
$ oc get nodes
```

Example output

```terminal

# Adding worker nodes to single-node OpenShift clusters manually

You can add a worker node to a single-node OpenShift cluster manually by booting the worker node from Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) ISO and by using the cluster worker.ign file to join the new worker node to the cluster.

* Install a single-node OpenShift cluster on bare metal.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* Ensure that all the required DNS records exist for the cluster that you are adding the worker node to.

1. Set the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version:

```terminal
$ OCP_VERSION=<ocp_version> 1
```

Replace <ocp_version> with the current version, for example, latest-4.19
2. Set the host architecture:

```terminal
$ ARCH=<architecture> 1
```

Replace <architecture> with the target host architecture, for example, aarch64 or x86_64.
3. Get the worker.ign data from the running single-node cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc extract -n openshift-machine-api secret/worker-user-data-managed --keys=userData --to=- > worker.ign
```

4. Host the worker.ign file on a web server accessible from your network.
5. Download the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installer and make it available for use by running the following commands:

```terminal
$ curl -k https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/$OCP_VERSION/openshift-install-linux.tar.gz > openshift-install-linux.tar.gz
```


```terminal
$ tar zxvf openshift-install-linux.tar.gz
```


```terminal
$ chmod +x openshift-install
```

6. Retrieve the RHCOS ISO URL:

```terminal
$ ISO_URL=$(./openshift-install coreos print-stream-json | grep location | grep $ARCH | grep iso | cut -d\" -f4)
```

7. Download the RHCOS ISO:

```terminal
$ curl -L $ISO_URL -o rhcos-live.iso
```

8. Use the RHCOS ISO and the hosted worker.ign file to install the worker node:
1. Boot the target host with the RHCOS ISO and your preferred method of installation.
2. When the target host has booted from the RHCOS ISO, open a console on the target host.
3. If your local network does not have DHCP enabled, you need to create an ignition file with the new hostname and configure the worker node static IP address before running the RHCOS installation. Perform the following steps:
1. Configure the worker host network connection with a static IP. Run the following command on the target host console:

```terminal
$ nmcli con mod <network_interface> ipv4.method manual /
ipv4.addresses <static_ip> ipv4.gateway <network_gateway> ipv4.dns <dns_server> /
802-3-ethernet.mtu 9000
```


where:
<static_ip>:: Is the host static IP address and CIDR, for example, 10.1.101.50/24
<network_gateway>:: Is the network gateway, for example, 10.1.101.1
2. Activate the modified network interface:

```terminal
$ nmcli con up <network_interface>
```

3. Create a new ignition file new-worker.ign that includes a reference to the original worker.ign and an additional instruction that the coreos-installer program uses to populate the /etc/hostname file on the new worker host. For example:

```json
{
  "ignition":{
    "version":"3.2.0",
    "config":{
      "merge":[
        {
          "source":"<hosted_worker_ign_file>" 1
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "storage":{
    "files":[
      {
        "path":"/etc/hostname",
        "contents":{
          "source":"data:,<new_fqdn>" 2
        },
        "mode":420,
        "overwrite":true,
        "path":"/etc/hostname"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

<hosted_worker_ign_file> is the locally accessible URL for the original worker.ign file. For example, http://webserver.example.com/worker.ign
<new_fqdn> is the new FQDN that you set for the worker node. For example, new-worker.example.com.
4. Host the new-worker.ign file on a web server accessible from your network.
5. Run the following coreos-installer command, passing in the ignition-url and hard disk details:

```terminal
$ sudo coreos-installer install --copy-network /
--ignition-url=<new_worker_ign_file> <hard_disk> --insecure-ignition
```


where:
<new_worker_ign_file>:: is the locally accessible URL for the hosted new-worker.ign file, for example, http://webserver.example.com/new-worker.ign
<hard_disk>:: Is the hard disk where you install RHCOS, for example, /dev/sda
4. For networks that have DHCP enabled, you do not need to set a static IP. Run the following coreos-installer command from the target host console to install the system:

```terminal
$ coreos-installer install --ignition-url=<hosted_worker_ign_file> <hard_disk>
```

5. To manually enable DHCP, apply the following NMStateConfig CR to the single-node OpenShift cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: agent-install.openshift.io/v1
kind: NMStateConfig
metadata:
  name: nmstateconfig-dhcp
  namespace: example-sno
  labels:
    nmstate_config_cluster_name: <nmstate_config_cluster_label>
spec:
  config:
    interfaces:
      - name: eth0
        type: ethernet
        state: up
        ipv4:
          enabled: true
          dhcp: true
        ipv6:
          enabled: false
  interfaces:
    - name: "eth0"
      macAddress: "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:11"
```

The NMStateConfig CR is required for successful deployments of worker nodes with static IP addresses and for adding a worker node with a dynamic IP address if the single-node OpenShift was deployed with a static IP address. The cluster network DHCP does not automatically set these network settings for the new worker node.
----
9. As the installation proceeds, the installation generates pending certificate signing requests (CSRs) for the worker node. When prompted, approve the pending CSRs to complete the installation.
10. When the install is complete, reboot the host. The host joins the cluster as a new worker node.

* Check that the new worker node was successfully added to the cluster with a status of Ready:

```terminal
$ oc get nodes
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                           STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
control-plane-1.example.com    Ready    master,worker   56m   v1.32.3
compute-1.example.com          Ready    worker          11m   v1.32.3
```

# Approving the certificate signing requests for your machines

When you add machines to a cluster, two pending certificate signing requests (CSRs) are generated for each machine that you added. You must confirm that these CSRs are approved or, if necessary, approve them yourself. The client requests must be approved first, followed by the server requests.

* You added machines to your cluster.

1. Confirm that the cluster recognizes the machines:

```terminal
$ oc get nodes
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME      STATUS    ROLES   AGE  VERSION
master-0  Ready     master  63m  v1.32.3
master-1  Ready     master  63m  v1.32.3
master-2  Ready     master  64m  v1.32.3
```


The output lists all of the machines that you created.

[NOTE]
----
The preceding output might not include the compute nodes, also known as worker nodes, until some CSRs are approved.
----
2. Review the pending CSRs and ensure that you see the client requests with the Pending or Approved status for each machine that you added to the cluster:

```terminal
$ oc get csr
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME        AGE     REQUESTOR                                                                   CONDITION
csr-8b2br   15m     system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Pending
csr-8vnps   15m     system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Pending
...
```


In this example, two machines are joining the cluster. You might see more approved CSRs in the list.
3. If the CSRs were not approved, after all of the pending CSRs for the machines you added are in Pending status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines:

[NOTE]
----
Because the CSRs rotate automatically, approve your CSRs within an hour of adding the machines to the cluster. If you do not approve them within an hour, the certificates will rotate, and more than two certificates will be present for each node. You must approve all of these certificates. After the client CSR is approved, the Kubelet creates a secondary CSR for the serving certificate, which requires manual approval. Then, subsequent serving certificate renewal requests are automatically approved by the machine-approver if the Kubelet requests a new certificate with identical parameters.
----

[NOTE]
----
For clusters running on platforms that are not machine API enabled, such as bare metal and other user-provisioned infrastructure, you must implement a method of automatically approving the kubelet serving certificate requests (CSRs). If a request is not approved, then the oc exec, oc rsh, and oc logs commands cannot succeed, because a serving certificate is required when the API server connects to the kubelet. Any operation that contacts the Kubelet endpoint requires this certificate approval to be in place. The method must watch for new CSRs, confirm that the CSR was submitted by the node-bootstrapper service account in the system:node or system:admin groups, and confirm the identity of the node.
----
* To approve them individually, run the following command for each valid CSR:

```terminal
$ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name> 1
```

<csr_name> is the name of a CSR from the list of current CSRs.
* To approve all pending CSRs, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs --no-run-if-empty oc adm certificate approve
```


[NOTE]
----
Some Operators might not become available until some CSRs are approved.
----
4. Now that your client requests are approved, you must review the server requests for each machine that you added to the cluster:

```terminal
$ oc get csr
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME        AGE     REQUESTOR                                                                   CONDITION
csr-bfd72   5m26s   system:node:ip-10-0-50-126.us-east-2.compute.internal                       Pending
csr-c57lv   5m26s   system:node:ip-10-0-95-157.us-east-2.compute.internal                       Pending
...
```

5. If the remaining CSRs are not approved, and are in the Pending status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines:
* To approve them individually, run the following command for each valid CSR:

```terminal
$ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name> 1
```

<csr_name> is the name of a CSR from the list of current CSRs.
* To approve all pending CSRs, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs oc adm certificate approve
```

6. After all client and server CSRs have been approved, the machines have the Ready status. Verify this by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get nodes
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME      STATUS    ROLES   AGE  VERSION
master-0  Ready     master  73m  v1.32.3
master-1  Ready     master  73m  v1.32.3
master-2  Ready     master  74m  v1.32.3
worker-0  Ready     worker  11m  v1.32.3
worker-1  Ready     worker  11m  v1.32.3
```


[NOTE]
----
It can take a few minutes after approval of the server CSRs for the machines to transition to the Ready status.
