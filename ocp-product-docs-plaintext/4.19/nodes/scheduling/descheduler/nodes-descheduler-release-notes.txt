# Release notes for Kube Descheduler Operator 5.1.2

Issued: 1 May 2025

The following advisory is available for the Kube Descheduler Operator 5.1.2:

* RHBA-2025:4334

## New features and enhancements

* This release of the Kube Descheduler Operator adds a new Technology Preview descheduler profile called DevKubeVirtRelieveAndMigrate. This profile is only available for use with OpenShift Virtualization.

## Bug fixes

* Previously, when the LifecycleAndUtilization profile was enabled, pods from protected namespaces (openshift-*, kube-system, hypershift) could be evicted. Pods in these namespaces should never be evicted. With this release, these protected namespaces are now properly excluded from eviction when the LifecycleAndUtilization profile is enabled. (OCPBUGS-54414)
