# Automatically scaling pods with the horizontal pod autoscaler


As a developer, you can use a horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) to
specify how Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform should automatically increase or decrease the scale of
a replication controller or deployment configuration, based on metrics collected
from the pods that belong to that replication controller or deployment
configuration. You can create an HPA for any deployment, deployment config, replica set, replication controller, or stateful set.
For information on scaling pods based on custom metrics, see Automatically scaling pods based on custom metrics.

[NOTE]
----
It is recommended to use a Deployment object or ReplicaSet object unless you need a specific feature or behavior provided by other objects. For more information on
these objects, see Understanding deployments.

# Understanding horizontal pod autoscalers

You can create a horizontal pod autoscaler to specify the minimum and maximum number of pods you want to run, and the CPU usage or memory usage your pods should target.

After you create a horizontal pod autoscaler, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform begins to query the CPU, memory, or both resource metrics on the pods. When these metrics are available, the horizontal pod autoscaler computes the ratio of the current metric use with the intended metric use, and scales up or down as needed. The query and scaling occurs at a regular interval, but can take one to two minutes before metrics become available.

For replication controllers, this scaling corresponds directly to the replicas of the replication controller. For deployment, scaling corresponds directly to the replica count of the deployment. Note that autoscaling applies only to the latest deployment in the Complete phase.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform automatically accounts for resources and prevents unnecessary autoscaling during resource spikes, such as during start up. Pods in the unready state have 0 CPU usage when scaling up and the autoscaler ignores the pods when scaling down. Pods without known metrics have 0% CPU usage when scaling up and 100% CPU when scaling down. This allows for more stability during the HPA decision. To use this feature, you must configure readiness checks to determine if a new pod is ready for use.

## Supported metrics

The following metrics are supported by horizontal pod autoscalers:




[IMPORTANT]
----
For memory-based autoscaling, memory usage must increase and decrease proportionally to the replica count. On average:
* An increase in replica count must lead to an overall decrease in memory
(working set) usage per-pod.
* A decrease in replica count must lead to an overall increase in per-pod memory usage.
Use the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console to check the memory behavior of your application and ensure that your application meets these requirements before using memory-based autoscaling.
----

The following example shows autoscaling for the hello-node Deployment object. The initial deployment requires 3 pods. The HPA object increases the minimum to 5. If CPU usage on the pods reaches 75%, the pods increase to 7:


```terminal
$ oc autoscale deployment/hello-node --min=5 --max=7 --cpu-percent=75
```



```terminal
horizontalpodautoscaler.autoscaling/hello-node autoscaled
```



```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v1
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: hello-node
  namespace: default
spec:
  maxReplicas: 7
  minReplicas: 3
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: hello-node
  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 75
status:
  currentReplicas: 5
  desiredReplicas: 0
```


After you create the HPA, you can view the new state of the deployment by running the following command:


```terminal
$ oc get deployment hello-node
```


There are now 5 pods in the deployment:


```terminal
NAME         REVISION   DESIRED   CURRENT   TRIGGERED BY
hello-node   1          5         5         config
```


# How does the HPA work?

The horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) extends the concept of pod auto-scaling. The HPA lets you create and manage a group of load-balanced nodes. The HPA automatically increases or decreases the number of pods when a given CPU or memory threshold is crossed.

![workflow]

The HPA is an API resource in the Kubernetes autoscaling API group. The autoscaler works as a control loop with a default of 15 seconds for the sync period. During this period, the controller manager queries the CPU, memory utilization, or both, against what is defined in the YAML file for the HPA.
The controller manager obtains the utilization metrics from the resource metrics API for per-pod resource metrics like CPU or memory, for each pod that is targeted by the HPA.

If a utilization value target is set, the controller calculates the utilization value as a percentage of the equivalent resource request on the containers in each pod. The controller then takes the average of utilization across all targeted pods and produces a ratio that is used to scale the number of desired replicas.
The HPA is configured to fetch metrics from metrics.k8s.io, which is provided by the metrics server. Because of the dynamic nature of metrics evaluation, the number of replicas can fluctuate during scaling for a group of replicas.


[NOTE]
----
To implement the HPA, all targeted pods must have a resource request set on their containers.
----

# About requests and limits

The scheduler uses the resource request that you specify for containers in a pod, to decide which node to place the pod on. The kubelet enforces the resource limit that you specify for a container to ensure that the container is not allowed to use more than the specified limit.
The kubelet also reserves the request amount of that system resource specifically for that container to use.

In the pod specifications, you must specify the resource requests, such as CPU and memory. The HPA uses this specification to determine the resource utilization and then scales the target up or down.

For example, the HPA object uses the following metric source:


```yaml
type: Resource
resource:
  name: cpu
  target:
    type: Utilization
    averageUtilization: 60
```


In this example, the HPA keeps the average utilization of the pods in the scaling target at 60%. Utilization is the ratio between the current resource usage to the requested resource of the pod.

# Best practices

For optimal performance, configure resource requests for all pods. To prevent frequent replica fluctuations, configure the cooldown period.

All pods must have resource requests configured:: The HPA makes a scaling decision based on the observed CPU or memory usage values of pods in an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. Utilization values are calculated as a percentage of the resource requests of each pod. Missing resource request values can affect the optimal performance of the HPA.
Configure the cool down period:: During horizontal pod autoscaling, there might be a rapid scaling of events without a time gap. Configure the cool down period to prevent frequent replica fluctuations. You can specify a cool down period by configuring the stabilizationWindowSeconds field. The stabilization window is used to restrict the fluctuation of replicas count when the metrics used for scaling keep fluctuating. The autoscaling algorithm uses this window to infer a previous required state and avoid unwanted changes to workload scale.

For example, a stabilization window is specified for the scaleDown field:


```yaml
behavior:
  scaleDown:
    stabilizationWindowSeconds: 300
```


In the previous example, all intended states for the past 5 minutes are considered. This approximates a rolling maximum, and avoids having the scaling algorithm often remove pods only to trigger recreating an equal pod just moments later.

## Scaling policies

Use the autoscaling/v2 API to add scaling policies to a horizontal pod autoscaler. A scaling policy controls how the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) scales pods. Use scaling policies to restrict the rate that HPAs scale pods up or down by setting a specific number or specific percentage to scale in a specified period of time. You can also define a stabilization window, which uses previously computed required states to control scaling if the metrics are fluctuating. You can create multiple policies for the same scaling direction, and determine the policy to use, based on the amount of change. You can also restrict the scaling by timed iterations. The HPA scales pods during an iteration, then performs scaling, as needed, in further iterations.


```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: hpa-resource-metrics-memory
  namespace: default
spec:
  behavior:
    scaleDown: 1
      policies: 2
      - type: Pods 3
        value: 4 4
        periodSeconds: 60 5
      - type: Percent
        value: 10 6
        periodSeconds: 60
      selectPolicy: Min 7
      stabilizationWindowSeconds: 300 8
    scaleUp: 9
      policies:
      - type: Pods
        value: 5 10
        periodSeconds: 70
      - type: Percent
        value: 12 11
        periodSeconds: 80
      selectPolicy: Max
      stabilizationWindowSeconds: 0
...
```


Specifies the direction for the scaling policy, either scaleDown or scaleUp. This example creates a policy for scaling down.
Defines the scaling policy.
Determines if the policy scales by a specific number of pods or a percentage of pods during each iteration. The default value is pods.
Limits the amount of scaling, either the number of pods or percentage of pods, during each iteration. There is no default value for scaling down by number of pods.
Determines the length of a scaling iteration. The default value is 15 seconds.
The default value for scaling down by percentage is 100%.
Determines the policy to use first, if multiple policies are defined. Specify Max to use the policy that allows the highest amount of change, Min to use the policy that allows the lowest amount of change, or Disabled to prevent the HPA from scaling in that policy direction. The default value is Max.
Determines the time period the HPA reviews the required states. The default value is 0.
This example creates a policy for scaling up.
Limits the amount of scaling up by the number of pods. The default value for scaling up the number of pods is 4%.
Limits the amount of scaling up by the percentage of pods. The default value for scaling up by percentage is 100%.


```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: hpa-resource-metrics-memory
  namespace: default
spec:
...
  minReplicas: 20
...
  behavior:
    scaleDown:
      stabilizationWindowSeconds: 300
      policies:
      - type: Pods
        value: 4
        periodSeconds: 30
      - type: Percent
        value: 10
        periodSeconds: 60
      selectPolicy: Max
    scaleUp:
      selectPolicy: Disabled
```


In this example, when the number of pods is greater than 40, the percent-based policy is used for scaling down, as that policy results in a larger change, as required by the selectPolicy.

If there are 80 pod replicas, in the first iteration the HPA reduces the pods by 8, which is 10% of the 80 pods (based on the type: Percent and value: 10 parameters), over one minute (periodSeconds: 60). For the next iteration, the number of pods is 72. The HPA calculates that 10% of the remaining pods is 7.2, which it rounds up to 8 and scales down 8 pods. On each subsequent iteration, the number of pods to be scaled is re-calculated based on the number of remaining pods. When the number of pods falls to less than 40, the pods-based policy is applied, because the pod-based number is greater than the percent-based number. The HPA reduces 4 pods at a time (type: Pods and value: 4), over 30 seconds (periodSeconds: 30), until there are 20 replicas remaining (minReplicas).

The selectPolicy: Disabled parameter prevents the HPA from scaling up the pods. You can manually scale up by adjusting the number of replicas in the replica set or deployment set, if needed.

If set, you can view the scaling policy by using the oc edit command:


```terminal
$ oc edit hpa hpa-resource-metrics-memory
```



```terminal
apiVersion: autoscaling/v1
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  annotations:
    autoscaling.alpha.kubernetes.io/behavior:\
'{"ScaleUp":{"StabilizationWindowSeconds":0,"SelectPolicy":"Max","Policies":[{"Type":"Pods","Value":4,"PeriodSeconds":15},{"Type":"Percent","Value":100,"PeriodSeconds":15}]},\
"ScaleDown":{"StabilizationWindowSeconds":300,"SelectPolicy":"Min","Policies":[{"Type":"Pods","Value":4,"PeriodSeconds":60},{"Type":"Percent","Value":10,"PeriodSeconds":60}]}}'
...
```

# Creating a horizontal pod autoscaler for CPU utilization by using the CLI

Using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI, you can create a horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) to automatically scale an existing Deployment, DeploymentConfig, ReplicaSet, ReplicationController, or StatefulSet object. The HPA scales the pods associated with that object to maintain the CPU usage you specify.


[NOTE]
----
It is recommended to use a Deployment object or ReplicaSet object unless you need a specific feature or behavior provided by other objects.
----

The HPA increases and decreases the number of replicas between the minimum and maximum numbers to maintain the specified CPU utilization across all pods.

When autoscaling for CPU utilization, you can use the oc autoscale command and specify the minimum and maximum number of pods you want to run at any given time and the average CPU utilization your pods should target. If you do not specify a minimum, the pods are given default values from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform server.

To autoscale for a specific CPU value, create a HorizontalPodAutoscaler object with the target CPU and pod limits.

To use horizontal pod autoscalers, your cluster administrator must have properly configured cluster metrics.
You can use the oc describe PodMetrics <pod-name> command to determine if metrics are configured. If metrics are
configured, the output appears similar to the following, with Cpu and Memory displayed under Usage.


```terminal
$ oc describe PodMetrics openshift-kube-scheduler-ip-10-0-135-131.ec2.internal

To create a horizontal pod autoscaler for CPU utilization:

1. Perform one of the following:
* To scale based on the percent of CPU utilization, create a HorizontalPodAutoscaler object for an existing object:

```terminal
$ oc autoscale <object_type>/<name> \1
  --min <number> \2
  --max <number> \3
  --cpu-percent=<percent> 4
```

Specify the type and name of the object to autoscale. The object must exist and be a Deployment, DeploymentConfig/dc, ReplicaSet/rs, ReplicationController/rc, or StatefulSet.
Optionally, specify the minimum number of replicas when scaling down.
Specify the maximum number of replicas when scaling up.
Specify the target average CPU utilization over all the pods, represented as a percent of requested CPU. If not specified or negative, a default autoscaling policy is used.

For example, the following command shows autoscaling for the hello-node deployment object. The initial deployment requires 3 pods. The HPA object increases the minimum to 5. If CPU usage on the pods reaches 75%, the pods will increase to 7:

```terminal
$ oc autoscale deployment/hello-node --min=5 --max=7 --cpu-percent=75
```

* To scale for a specific CPU value, create a YAML file similar to the following for an existing object:

# Creating a horizontal pod autoscaler object for memory utilization by using the CLI

Using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI, you can create a horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) to automatically scale an existing
Deployment, DeploymentConfig, ReplicaSet, ReplicationController, or StatefulSet object. The HPA
scales the pods associated with that object to maintain the average memory utilization you specify, either a direct value or a percentage
of requested memory.


[NOTE]
----
It is recommended to use a Deployment object or ReplicaSet object unless you need a specific feature or behavior provided by other objects.

The HPA increases and decreases the number of replicas between the minimum and maximum numbers to maintain
the specified memory utilization across all pods.

For memory utilization, you can specify the minimum and maximum number of pods and the average memory utilization
your pods should target. If you do not specify a minimum, the pods are given default values from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform server.

To use horizontal pod autoscalers, your cluster administrator must have properly configured cluster metrics.

# Understanding horizontal pod autoscaler status conditions by using the CLI

You can use the status conditions set to determine
whether or not the horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) is able to scale and whether or not it is currently restricted
in any way.

The HPA status conditions are available with the v2 version of the
autoscaling API.

The HPA responds with the following status conditions:

* The AbleToScale condition indicates whether HPA is able to fetch and update metrics, as well as whether any backoff-related conditions could prevent scaling.
* A True condition indicates scaling is allowed.
* A False condition indicates scaling is not allowed for the reason specified.
* The ScalingActive condition indicates whether the HPA is enabled (for example, the replica count of the target is not zero) and is able to calculate desired metrics.
* A True condition indicates metrics is working properly.
* A False condition generally indicates a problem with fetching metrics.
* The ScalingLimited condition indicates that the desired scale was capped by the maximum or minimum of the horizontal pod autoscaler.
* A True condition indicates that you need to raise or lower the minimum or maximum replica count in order to scale.
* A False condition indicates that the requested scaling is allowed.

```terminal
$ oc describe hpa cm-test
```

The horizontal pod autoscaler status messages.

The following is an example of a pod that is unable to scale:


```text
Conditions:
  Type         Status  Reason          Message
  ----         ------  ------          -------
  AbleToScale  False   FailedGetScale  the HPA controller was unable to get the target's current scale: no matches for kind "ReplicationController" in group "apps"
Events:

  Warning  FailedGetScale  6s (x3 over 36s)  horizontal-pod-autoscaler  no matches for kind "ReplicationController" in group "apps"
```


The following is an example of a pod that could not obtain the needed metrics for scaling:


```text

  Type                  Status    Reason                    Message

  ScalingActive         False    FailedGetResourceMetric    the HPA was unable to compute the replica count: failed to get cpu utilization: unable to get metrics for resource cpu: no metrics returned from resource metrics API
```


The following is an example of a pod where the requested autoscaling was less than the required minimums:


```text
Conditions:
  Type              Status    Reason              Message
  ----              ------    ------              -------

  ScalingActive     True      ValidMetricFound    the HPA was able to successfully calculate a replica count from pods metric http_request
  ScalingLimited    False     DesiredWithinRange  the desired replica count is within the acceptable range
```


## Viewing horizontal pod autoscaler status conditions by using the CLI

You can view the status conditions set on a pod by the horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA).


[NOTE]
----
The horizontal pod autoscaler status conditions are available with the v2 version of the autoscaling API.
----

To use horizontal pod autoscalers, your cluster administrator must have properly configured cluster metrics.
You can use the oc describe PodMetrics <pod-name> command to determine if metrics are configured.  If metrics are
configured, the output appears similar to the following, with Cpu and Memory displayed under Usage.


```terminal
$ oc describe PodMetrics openshift-kube-scheduler-ip-10-0-135-131.ec2.internal
```



```terminal

```


To view the status conditions on a pod, use the following command with the name of the pod:


```terminal
$ oc describe hpa <pod-name>
```


For example:


```terminal
$ oc describe hpa cm-test
```


The conditions appear in the Conditions field in the output.
