# Viewing pods


As an administrator, you can view cluster pods, check their health, and evaluate the overall health of the cluster. You can also view a list of pods associated with a specific project or view usage statistics about pods. Regularly viewing pods can help you detect problems early, track resource usage, and ensure cluster stability.

# Viewing pods in a project

You can display pod usage statistics, such as CPU, memory, and storage consumption, to monitor container runtime environments and ensure efficient resource use.

1. Change to the project by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc project <project_name>
```

2. Obtain a list of pods by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get pods
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
console-698d866b78-bnshf   1/1     Running   2          165m
console-698d866b78-m87pm   1/1     Running   2          165m
```

3. Optional: Add the -o wide flags to view the pod IP address and the node where the pod is located. For example:

```terminal
$ oc get pods -o wide
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE    IP            NODE                           NOMINATED NODE
console-698d866b78-bnshf   1/1     Running   2          166m   10.128.0.24   ip-10-0-152-71.ec2.internal    <none>
console-698d866b78-m87pm   1/1     Running   2          166m   10.129.0.23   ip-10-0-173-237.ec2.internal   <none>
```


# Viewing pod usage statistics

You can display usage statistics about pods, which provide the runtime
environments for containers. These usage statistics include CPU, memory, and
storage consumption.

* You must have cluster-reader permission to view the usage statistics.
* Metrics must be installed to view the usage statistics.

1. View the usage statistics by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc adm top pods -n <namespace>
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                         CPU(cores)   MEMORY(bytes)
console-7f58c69899-q8c8k     0m           22Mi
console-7f58c69899-xhbgg     0m           25Mi
downloads-594fcccf94-bcxk8   3m           18Mi
downloads-594fcccf94-kv4p6   2m           15Mi
```

2. Optional: Add the --selector='' label to view usage statistics for pods with labels. Note that you must choose the label query to filter on, such as =, ==, or !=. For example:

```terminal
$ oc adm top pod --selector='<pod_name>'
```


# Viewing resource logs

You can view logs for resources in the OpenShift CLI (oc) or web console. Logs display from the end (or tail) by default. Viewing logs for resources can help you troubleshoot issues and monitor resource behavior.

## Viewing resource logs by using the web console

Use the following procedure to view resource logs by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

1. In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform console, navigate to Workloads -> Pods or navigate to the pod through the resource you want to investigate.

[NOTE]
----
Some resources, such as builds, do not have pods to query directly. In such instances, you can locate the Logs link on the Details page for the resource.
----
2. Select a project from the drop-down menu.
3. Click the name of the pod you want to investigate.
4. Click Logs.

## Viewing resource logs by using the CLI

Use the following procedure to view resource logs by using the command-line interface (CLI).

* Access to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* View the log for a specific pod by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc logs -f <pod_name> -c <container_name>
```

where:
-f:: Optional: Specifies that the output follows what is being written into the logs.
<pod_name>:: Specifies the name of the pod.
<container_name>:: Optional: Specifies the name of a container. When a pod has more than one container, you must specify the container name.

For example:

```terminal
$ oc logs -f ruby-57f7f4855b-znl92 -c ruby
```

* View the log for a specific resource by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc logs <object_type>/<resource_name>
```


For example:

```terminal
$ oc logs deployment/ruby
```
