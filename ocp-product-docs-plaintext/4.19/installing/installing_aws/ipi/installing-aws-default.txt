# Installing a cluster on AWS


In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.19, you can install a cluster on
Amazon Web Services (AWS) that uses the default configuration options.

# Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation and update processes.
* You read the documentation on selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users.
* You configured an AWS account to host the cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
----
If you have an AWS profile stored on your computer, it must not use a temporary session token that you generated while using a multi-factor authentication device. The cluster continues to use your current AWS credentials to create AWS resources for the entire life of the cluster, so you must use key-based, long-term credentials. To generate appropriate keys, see Managing Access Keys for IAM Users in the AWS documentation. You can supply the keys when you run the installation program.
----
* If you use a firewall, you configured it to allow the sites that your cluster requires access to.

# Deploying the cluster

You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on a compatible cloud platform.


[IMPORTANT]
----
You can run the create cluster command of the installation program only once, during initial installation.
----

* You have configured an account with the cloud platform that hosts your cluster.
* You have the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.
* You have verified that the cloud provider account on your host has the correct permissions to deploy the cluster. An account with incorrect permissions causes the installation process to fail with an error message that displays the missing permissions.

1. In the directory that contains the installation program, initialize the cluster deployment by running the following command:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install create cluster --dir <installation_directory> \ 1
    --log-level=info 2
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the
directory name to store the files that the installation program creates.
To view different installation details, specify warn, debug, or
error instead of info.

When specifying the directory:
* Verify that the directory has the execute permission. This permission is required to run Terraform binaries under the installation directory.
* Use an empty directory. Some installation assets, such as bootstrap X.509 certificates, have short expiration intervals, therefore you must not reuse an installation directory. If you want to reuse individual files from another cluster installation, you can copy them into your directory. However, the file names for the installation assets might change between releases. Use caution when copying installation files from an earlier Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version.
2. Provide values at the prompts:
1. Optional: Select an SSH key to use to access your cluster machines.

[NOTE]
----
For production Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your ssh-agent process uses.
----
2. Select aws as the platform to target.
3. If you do not have an Amazon Web Services (AWS) profile stored on your computer, enter the AWS access key ID and secret access key for the user that you configured to run the
installation program.

[NOTE]
----
The AWS access key ID and secret access key are stored in ~/.aws/credentials in the home directory of the current user on the installation host. You are prompted for the credentials by the installation program if the credentials for the exported profile are not present in the file. Any credentials that you provide to the installation program are stored in the file.
----
4. Select the AWS region to deploy the cluster to.
5. Select the base domain for the Route 53 service that you configured for your cluster.
6. Enter a descriptive name for your cluster.
7. Paste the pull secret from Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager.
3. Optional: Remove or disable the AdministratorAccess policy from the IAM
account that you used to install the cluster.

[NOTE]
----
The elevated permissions provided by the AdministratorAccess policy are required only during installation.
----

When the cluster deployment completes successfully:

* The terminal displays directions for accessing your cluster, including a link to the web console and credentials for the kubeadmin user.
* Credential information also outputs to <installation_directory>/.openshift_install.log.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not delete the installation program or the files that the installation program creates. Both are required to delete the cluster.
----


```terminal
...
INFO Install complete!
INFO To access the cluster as the system:admin user when using 'oc', run 'export KUBECONFIG=/home/myuser/install_dir/auth/kubeconfig'
INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.mycluster.example.com
INFO Login to the console with user: "kubeadmin", and password: "password"
INFO Time elapsed: 36m22s
```



[IMPORTANT]
----
* The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending node-bootstrapper certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for Recovering from expired control plane certificates for more information.
* It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.

# Logging in to the cluster by using the CLI

You can log in to your cluster as a default system user by exporting the cluster kubeconfig file.
The kubeconfig file contains information about the cluster that is used by the CLI to connect a client to the correct cluster and API server.
The file is specific to a cluster and is created during Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation.

* You deployed an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

1. Export the kubeadmin credentials by running the following command:

```terminal
$ export KUBECONFIG=<installation_directory>/auth/kubeconfig 1
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the path to the directory that you stored
the installation files in.
2. Verify you can run oc commands successfully using the exported configuration by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc whoami
```

Example output

```terminal
system:admin
```


# Logging in to the cluster by using the web console

The kubeadmin user exists by default after an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation. You can log in to your cluster as the kubeadmin user by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

* You have access to the installation host.
* You completed a cluster installation and all cluster Operators are available.

1. Obtain the password for the kubeadmin user from the kubeadmin-password file on the installation host:

```terminal
$ cat <installation_directory>/auth/kubeadmin-password
```


[NOTE]
----
Alternatively, you can obtain the kubeadmin password from the <installation_directory>/.openshift_install.log log file on the installation host.
----
2. List the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console route:

```terminal
$ oc get routes -n openshift-console | grep 'console-openshift'
```


[NOTE]
----
Alternatively, you can obtain the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform route from the <installation_directory>/.openshift_install.log log file on the installation host.
----
Example output

```terminal
console     console-openshift-console.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>            console     https   reencrypt/Redirect   None
```

3. Navigate to the route detailed in the output of the preceding command in a web browser and log in as the kubeadmin user.

* Accessing the web console

# Next steps

* Validating an installation.
* Customize your cluster.
* If necessary, you can Remote health reporting.
* If necessary, you can remove cloud provider credentials.
