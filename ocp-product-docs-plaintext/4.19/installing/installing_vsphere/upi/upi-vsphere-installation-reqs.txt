# vSphere installation requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure


Before you begin an installation on infrastructure that you provision, be sure that your vSphere environment meets the following installation requirements.

# VMware vSphere infrastructure requirements

You must install an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on one of the following versions of a VMware vSphere instance that meets the requirements for the components that you use:

* Version 8.0 Update 1 or later, or VMware Cloud Foundation 5.0 or later
* VMware vSphere Foundation 9 or later, or VMware Cloud Foundation 9 or later

Both of these releases support Container Storage Interface (CSI) migration, which is enabled by default on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19.

You can host the VMware vSphere infrastructure on-premise or on a VMware Cloud Verified provider that meets the requirements outlined in the following tables:




[IMPORTANT]
----
You must ensure that the time on your ESXi hosts is synchronized before you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. See Edit Time Configuration for a Host in the VMware documentation.
----




[IMPORTANT]
----
To ensure the best performance conditions for your cluster workloads that operate on Oracle(R) Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and on the Oracle(R) Cloud VMware Solution (OCVS) service, ensure volume performance units (VPUs) for your block volume are sized for your workloads.
The following list provides some guidance in selecting the VPUs needed for specific performance needs:
* Test or proof of concept environment: 100 GB, and 20 to 30 VPUs.
* Base-production environment: 500 GB, and 60 VPUs.
* Heavy-use production environment: More than 500 GB, and 100 or more VPUs.
Consider allocating additional VPUs to give enough capacity for updates and scaling activities. See Block Volume Performance Levels (Oracle documentation).
----


[NOTE]
----
The following additional VMware vSphere Foundation and VMware Cloud Foundation components are outside the scope of Red Hat support:
* Management: VCF Operations, VCF Automation, VCF Fleet Management, and VCF Identity Broker.
* Networking: VMware NSX Container Plugin (NCP).
* Migration: VMware HCX.
----

# VMware vSphere CSI Driver Operator requirements

To install the vSphere Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver Operator, the following requirements must be met:

* VMware vSphere version 8.0 Update 1 or later; or VMware vSphere Foundation (VVF) 9; or VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) 5 or later
* vCenter version 8.0 Update 1 or later; or VVF 9; or VCF 5 or later
* Virtual machines of hardware version 15 or later
* No third-party vSphere CSI driver already installed in the cluster

If a third-party vSphere CSI driver is present in the cluster, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform does not overwrite it. The presence of a third-party vSphere CSI driver prevents Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform from updating to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.13 or later.


[NOTE]
----
The VMware vSphere CSI Driver Operator is supported only on clusters deployed with platform: vsphere in the installation manifest.
----

You can create a custom role for the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver, the vSphere CSI Driver Operator, and the vSphere Problem Detector Operator. The custom role can include privilege sets that assign a minimum set of permissions to each vSphere object. This means that the CSI driver, the vSphere CSI Driver Operator, and the vSphere Problem Detector Operator can establish a basic interaction with these objects.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Installing an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster in a vCenter is tested against a full list of privileges as described in the "Required vCenter account privileges" section. By adhering to the full list of privileges, you can reduce the possibility of unexpected and unsupported behaviors that might occur when creating a custom role with a set of restricted privileges.
----

* To remove a third-party vSphere CSI driver, see Removing a third-party vSphere CSI Driver.
* To update the hardware version for your vSphere nodes, see Updating hardware on nodes running in vSphere.
* Minimum permissions for the storage components

# Requirements for a cluster with user-provisioned infrastructure

For a cluster that contains user-provisioned infrastructure, you must deploy all of the required machines.

This section describes the requirements for deploying Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on user-provisioned infrastructure.

## vCenter requirements

Before you install an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on your vCenter that uses infrastructure that you provided, you must prepare your environment.

### Required vCenter account privileges

To install an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster in a vCenter, your vSphere account must include privileges for reading and creating the required resources. Using an account that has global administrative privileges is the simplest way to access all of the necessary permissions.





Additionally, the user requires some ReadOnly permissions, and some of the roles require permission to propagate the permissions to child objects. These settings vary depending on whether or not you install the cluster into an existing folder.



For more information about creating an account with only the required privileges, see vSphere Permissions and User Management Tasks in the vSphere documentation.

### Minimum required vCenter account privileges

After you create a custom role and assign privileges to the role, you can create permissions by selecting specific vSphere objects. You can then assign the custom role to a user or group for each object.

Before you create permissions or request for the creation of permissions for a vSphere object, decide what minimum permissions apply to the vSphere object. By doing this task, you can ensure a basic interaction exists between a vSphere object and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform architecture.


[IMPORTANT]
----
If you create a custom role and you do not assign privileges to it, the vSphere Server by default assigns a Read Only role to the custom role. Note that for the cloud provider API, the custom role only needs to inherit the privileges of the Read Only role.
----

Consider creating a custom role when an account with global administrative privileges does not meet your needs.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Red Hat does not support configuring an account without including the required privileges. Installing an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster in a vCenter is tested against a full list of privileges as described in the "Required vCenter account privileges" section. By adhering to the full list of privileges, you can reduce the possibility of unexpected behaviors that might occur when creating a custom role with a restricted set of privileges.
----

The following tables specify how the required vCenter account privileges provided earlier in this document are relevant to different aspects of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform architecture.







### Using Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform with vMotion

If you intend on using vMotion in your vSphere environment, consider the following before installing an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

* Using Storage vMotion can cause issues and is not supported.
* Using VMware compute vMotion to migrate the workloads for both Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform compute machines and control plane machines is generally supported, where generally implies that you meet all VMware best practices for vMotion.
To help ensure the uptime of your compute and control plane nodes, ensure that you follow the VMware best practices for vMotion, and use VMware anti-affinity rules to improve the availability of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform during maintenance or hardware issues.
For more information about vMotion and anti-affinity rules, see the VMware vSphere documentation for  vMotion networking requirements and VM anti-affinity rules.
* If you are using VMware vSphere volumes in your pods, migrating a VM across datastores, either manually or through Storage vMotion, causes invalid references within Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform persistent volume (PV) objects that can result in data loss.
* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform does not support selective migration of virtual machine disks (VMDKs) across datastores, using datastore clusters for VM provisioning or for dynamic or static provisioning of PVs, or using a datastore that is part of a datastore cluster for dynamic or static provisioning of PVs.

[IMPORTANT]
----
You can specify the path of any datastore that exists in a datastore cluster. By default, Storage Distributed Resource Scheduler (SDRS), which uses Storage vMotion, is automatically enabled for a datastore cluster. Red Hat does not support Storage vMotion, so you must disable SDRS to avoid data loss issues for your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
If you must specify VMs across many datastores, use a datastore object to specify a failure domain in your cluster's install-config.yaml configuration file. For more information, see "VMware vSphere region and zone enablement".
----

### Cluster resources

When you deploy an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster that uses infrastructure that you provided, you must create the following resources in your vCenter instance:

* 1 Folder
* 1 Tag category
* 1 Tag
* Virtual machines:
* 1 template
* 1 temporary bootstrap node
* 3 control plane nodes
* 3 compute machines

Although these resources use 856 GB of storage, the bootstrap node gets deleted during the cluster installation process. At a minimum, a standard cluster requires 800 GB of storage.

If you deploy more compute machines, the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster will use more storage.

### Cluster limits

Available resources vary between clusters. A limit exists for the number of possible clusters within vCenter, primarily by available storage space and any limitations on the number of required resources. Be sure to consider both limitations to the vCenter resources that the cluster creates and the resources that you require to deploy a cluster, such as IP addresses and networks.

### Networking requirements

You can use Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) for the network and configure the DHCP server to set persistent IP addresses to machines in your cluster. In the DHCP lease, you must configure the DHCP to use the default gateway.


[NOTE]
----
You do not need to use the DHCP for the network if you want to provision nodes with static IP addresses.
----

If you specify nodes or groups of nodes on different VLANs for a cluster that you want to install on user-provisioned infrastructure, you must ensure that machines in your cluster meet the requirements outlined in the "Network connectivity requirements" section of the Networking requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure document.

If you are installing to a restricted environment, the VM in your restricted network must have access to vCenter so that it can provision and manage nodes, persistent volume claims (PVCs), and other resources.


[NOTE]
----
Ensure that each Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform node in the cluster has access to a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server that is discoverable by DHCP. Installation is possible without an NTP server. However, asynchronous server clocks can cause errors, which the NTP server prevents.
----

Additionally, you must create the following networking resources before you install the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster:

#### DNS records

You must create DNS records for two static IP addresses in the appropriate DNS server for the vCenter instance that hosts your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. In each record, <cluster_name> is the cluster name and <base_domain> is the cluster base domain that you specify when you install the cluster. A complete DNS record takes the form: <component>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>..



* Creating a compute machine set on vSphere

## Required machines for cluster installation

You must specify the minimum required machines or hosts for your cluster so that your cluster remains stable if a node fails.

The smallest Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters require the following hosts:


[IMPORTANT]
----
For a cluster that contains user-provisioned infrastructure, you must deploy all of the required machines.
----




[IMPORTANT]
----
To maintain high availability of your cluster, use separate physical hosts for
these cluster machines.
----

The bootstrap and control plane machines must use Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) as the operating system. However, the compute machines can choose between Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS), Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.6 and later.

Note that RHCOS is based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9.2 and inherits all of its hardware certifications and requirements.
See Red Hat Enterprise Linux technology capabilities and limits.

## Minimum resource requirements for cluster installation

Each created cluster must meet minimum requirements so that the cluster runs as expected.



1. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and Kubernetes are sensitive to disk performance, and faster storage is recommended, particularly for etcd on the control plane nodes which require a 10 ms p99 fsync duration. Note that on many cloud platforms, storage size and IOPS scale together, so you might need to over-allocate storage volume to obtain sufficient performance.
2. As with all user-provisioned installations, if you choose to use RHEL compute machines in your cluster, you take responsibility for all operating system life cycle management and maintenance, including performing system updates, applying patches, and completing all other required tasks. Use of RHEL 7 compute machines is deprecated and has been removed in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 and later.


[NOTE]
----
For Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.19, RHCOS is based on RHEL version 9.6, which updates the micro-architecture requirements. The following list contains the minimum instruction set architectures (ISA) that each architecture requires:
* x86-64 architecture requires x86-64-v2 ISA
* ARM64 architecture requires ARMv8.0-A ISA
* IBM Power architecture requires Power 9 ISA
* s390x architecture requires z14 ISA
For more information, see Architectures (RHEL documentation).
----

If an instance type for your platform meets the minimum requirements for cluster machines, it is supported to use in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not use memory ballooning in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters. Memory ballooning can cause cluster-wide instabilities, service degradation, or other undefined behaviors.
* Control plane machines should have committed memory equal to or greater than the published minimum resource requirements for a cluster installation.
* Compute machines should have a minimum reservation equal to or greater than the published minimum resource requirements for a cluster installation.
These minimum CPU and memory requirements do not account for resources required by user workloads.
For more information, see the Red Hat Knowledgebase article Memory Ballooning and OpenShift.
----

* Optimizing storage

## Requirements for encrypting virtual machines

You can encrypt your virtual machines prior to installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19 by meeting the following requirements.

* You have configured a Standard key provider in vSphere. For more information, see Adding a KMS to vCenter Server.

[IMPORTANT]
----
The Native key provider in vCenter is not supported. For more information, see vSphere Native Key Provider Overview.
----
* You have enabled host encryption mode on all of the ESXi hosts that are hosting the cluster. For more information, see Enabling host encryption mode.
* You have a vSphere account which has all cryptographic privileges enabled. For more information, see Cryptographic Operations Privileges.

When you deploy the OVF template in the section titled "Installing RHCOS and starting the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform bootstrap process", select the option to "Encrypt this virtual machine" when you are selecting storage for the OVF template. After completing cluster installation, create a storage class that uses the encryption storage policy you used to encrypt the virtual machines.

* Creating an encrypted storage class

## Certificate signing requests management

On user-provisioned infrastructure, you must provide a mechanism for approving cluster certificate signing requests (CSRs) after installation when your cluster has limited access to automatic machine management.

The kube-controller-manager only approves the kubelet client CSRs. The machine-approver cannot guarantee the validity of a serving certificate that is requested by using kubelet credentials because it cannot confirm that the correct machine issued the request. You must determine and implement a method of verifying the validity of the kubelet serving certificate requests and approving them.

## Networking requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure

You must configure networking for all the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines in initramfs during boot, so that they can fetch their Ignition config files.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Ensure you enable the disk.EnableUUID parameter on all virtual machines in your cluster.
----

During the initial boot, the machines require an IP address configuration that is set either through a DHCP server or statically by providing the required boot options. After a network connection is established, the machines download their Ignition config files from an HTTP or HTTPS server. The Ignition config files are then used to set the exact state of each machine. The Machine Config Operator completes more changes to the machines, such as the application of new certificates or keys, after installation.


[NOTE]
----
* Consider using a DHCP server for long-term management of the cluster machines. Ensure that the DHCP server is configured to provide persistent IP addresses, DNS server information, and hostnames to the cluster machines.
* If a DHCP service is not available for your user-provisioned infrastructure, you can instead provide the IP networking configuration and the address of the DNS server to the nodes at RHCOS install time. These can be passed as boot arguments if you are installing from an ISO image. See the Installing RHCOS and starting the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform bootstrap process section for more information about static IP provisioning and advanced networking options.
----

The Kubernetes API server must be able to resolve the node names of the cluster machines. If the API servers and worker nodes are in different zones, you can configure a default DNS search zone to allow the API server to resolve the node names. Another supported approach is to always refer to hosts by their fully-qualified domain names in both the node objects and all DNS requests.

### Setting the cluster node hostnames through DHCP

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines, the hostname is set through NetworkManager. By default, the machines obtain their hostname through DHCP. If the hostname is not provided by DHCP, set statically through kernel arguments, or another method, it is obtained through a reverse DNS lookup. Reverse DNS lookup occurs after the network has been initialized on a node and can take time to resolve. Other system services can start prior to this and detect the hostname as localhost or similar. You can avoid this by using DHCP to provide the hostname for each cluster node.

Additionally, setting the hostnames through DHCP can bypass any manual DNS record name configuration errors in environments that have a DNS split-horizon implementation.

### Network connectivity requirements

You must configure the network connectivity between machines to allow Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster components to communicate. Each machine must be able to resolve the hostnames of all other machines in the cluster.

This section provides details about the ports that are required.


[IMPORTANT]
----
In connected Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform environments, all nodes are required to have internet access to pull images
for platform containers and provide telemetry data to Red Hat.
----







### NTP configuration for user-provisioned infrastructure

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters are configured to use a public Network Time Protocol (NTP) server by default. If you want to use a local enterprise NTP server, or if your cluster is being deployed in a disconnected network, you can configure the cluster to use a specific time server. For more information, see the documentation for Configuring chrony time service.

If a DHCP server provides NTP server information, the chrony time service on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines read the information and can sync the clock with the NTP servers.

* Configuring chrony time service

## User-provisioned DNS requirements

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform deployments, you must ensure that cluster components meet certain DNS name resolution criteria for internal communication, certificate validation, and automated node discovery purposes.

The following is a list of required cluster components:

* The Kubernetes API
* The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform application wildcard
* The bootstrap, control plane, and compute machines

Reverse DNS resolution is also required for the Kubernetes API, the bootstrap machine, the control plane machines, and the compute machines.

DNS A/AAAA or CNAME records are used for name resolution and PTR records are used for reverse name resolution. The reverse records are important because Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) uses the reverse records to set the hostnames for all the nodes, unless the hostnames are provided by DHCP. Additionally, the reverse records are used to generate the certificate signing requests (CSR) that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform needs to operate.


[NOTE]
----
It is recommended to use a DHCP server to provide the hostnames to each cluster node. See the DHCP recommendations for user-provisioned infrastructure section for more information.
----

The following DNS records are required for a user-provisioned Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster and they must be in place before installation. In each record, <cluster_name> is the cluster name and <base_domain> is the base domain that you specify in the install-config.yaml file. A complete DNS record takes the form: <component>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>..




[NOTE]
----
In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.4 and later, you do not need to specify etcd host and SRV records in your DNS configuration.
----


[TIP]
----
You can use the dig command to verify name and reverse name resolution. See the section on Validating DNS resolution for user-provisioned infrastructure for detailed validation steps.
----

### Example DNS configuration for user-provisioned clusters

Reference the example DNS configurations to understand how A and PTR record configuration samples meet the DNS requirements for deploying Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on user-provisioned infrastructure.

The DNS configuration examples provided here are for reference only and are not meant to provide advice for choosing one DNS solution over another.

In the examples, the cluster name is ocp4 and the base domain is example.com.

The following example is a BIND zone file that shows sample DNS A records for name resolution in a user-provisioned cluster.


[NOTE]
----
In the example, the same load balancer is used for the Kubernetes API and application ingress traffic. In production scenarios, you can deploy the API and application ingress load balancers separately so that you can scale the load balancer infrastructure for each in isolation.

## Load balancing requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure

Before you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, you must provision the API and application Ingress load balancing infrastructure. In production scenarios, you can deploy the API and application Ingress load balancers separately so that you can scale the load balancer infrastructure for each in isolation.


[NOTE]
----
If you want to deploy the API and application Ingress load balancers with a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) instance, you must purchase the RHEL subscription separately.
----

The load balancing infrastructure must meet the following requirements:

* API load balancer: Provides a common endpoint for users, both human and machine, to interact with and configure the platform. Configure the following conditions:
* Layer 4 load balancing only. This can be referred to as Raw TCP or SSL Passthrough mode.
* A stateless load balancing algorithm. The options vary based on the load balancer implementation.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not configure session persistence for an API load balancer. Configuring session persistence for a Kubernetes API server might cause performance issues from excess application traffic for your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster and the Kubernetes API that runs inside the cluster.
----

Configure the following ports on both the front and back of the API load balancers:




[NOTE]
----
The load balancer must be configured to take a maximum of 30 seconds from the
time the API server turns off the /readyz endpoint to the removal of the API
server instance from the pool. Within the time frame after /readyz returns an
error or becomes healthy, the endpoint must have been removed or added. Probing
every 5 or 10 seconds, with two successful requests to become healthy and three
to become unhealthy, are well-tested values.
----

* Application Ingress load balancer: Provides an ingress point for application traffic flowing in from outside the cluster. A working configuration for the Ingress router is required for an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. Configure the following conditions:
* Layer 4 load balancing only. This can be referred to as Raw TCP or SSL Passthrough mode.
* A connection-based or session-based persistence is recommended, based on the options available and types of applications that will be hosted on the platform.


[TIP]
----
If the true IP address of the client can be seen by the application Ingress load balancer, enabling source IP-based session persistence can improve performance for applications that use end-to-end TLS encryption.
----

Configure the following ports on both the front and back of the load balancers:




[NOTE]
----
If you are deploying a three-node cluster with zero compute nodes, the Ingress Controller pods run on the control plane nodes. In three-node cluster deployments, you must configure your application Ingress load balancer to route HTTP and HTTPS traffic to the control plane nodes.
----

### Example load balancer configuration for user-provisioned clusters

Reference the example API and application Ingress load balancer configuration so that you can understand how to meet the load balancing requirements for user-provisioned clusters.

The sample is an /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg configuration for an HAProxy load balancer. The example is not meant to provide advice for choosing one load balancing solution over another.


[TIP]
----
If you are using HAProxy as a load balancer, you can check that the haproxy process is listening on ports 6443, 22623, 443, and 80 by running netstat -nltupe on the HAProxy node.
----

In the example, the same load balancer is used for the Kubernetes API and application ingress traffic. In production scenarios, you can deploy the API and application ingress load balancers separately so that you can scale the load balancer infrastructure for each in isolation.


[NOTE]
----
If you are using HAProxy as a load balancer and SELinux is set to enforcing, you must ensure that the HAProxy service can bind to the configured TCP port by running setsebool -P haproxy_connect_any=1.

where:

listen api-server-6443:: Port 6443 handles the Kubernetes API traffic and points to the control plane machines.
server bootstrap bootstrap.ocp4.example.com:: The bootstrap entries must be in place before the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster installation and they must be removed after the bootstrap process is complete.
listen machine-config-server:: Port 22623 handles the machine config server traffic and points to the control plane machines.
listen ingress-router-443:: Port 443 handles the HTTPS traffic and points to the machines that run the Ingress Controller pods. The Ingress Controller pods run on the compute machines by default.
listen ingress-router-80:: Port 80 handles the HTTP traffic and points to the machines that run the Ingress Controller pods. The Ingress Controller pods run on the compute machines by default.

[NOTE]
----
If you are deploying a three-node cluster with zero compute nodes, the Ingress Controller pods run on the control plane nodes. In three-node cluster deployments, you must configure your application Ingress load balancer to route HTTP and HTTPS traffic to the control plane nodes.
