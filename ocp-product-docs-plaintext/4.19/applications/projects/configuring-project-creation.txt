# Configuring project creation


In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, projects are used to group and isolate related objects.
When a request is made to create a new project using the web console or oc
new-project command, an endpoint in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is used to provision the
project according to a template, which can be customized.
As
a cluster administrator, you can allow and configure how developers and service
accounts can create, or self-provision, their own projects.

# About project creation

The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform API server automatically provisions new projects based on
the project template that is identified by the projectRequestTemplate
parameter in the cluster&#8217;s project configuration resource. If the parameter is
not defined, the API server creates a default template that creates a project
with the requested name, and assigns the requesting user to the admin role for
that project.

When a project request is submitted, the API substitutes the following
parameters into the template:



Access to the API is granted to developers with the self-provisioner role and
the self-provisioners cluster role binding. This role is available to all
authenticated developers by default.

# Modifying the template for new projects

As a cluster administrator, you can modify the default project template so that new projects are created using your custom requirements.

To create your own custom project template:

* You have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster using an account with cluster-admin permissions.

1. Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
2. Generate the default project template:

```terminal
$ oc adm create-bootstrap-project-template -o yaml > template.yaml
```

3. Use a text editor to modify the generated template.yaml file by adding
objects or modifying existing objects.
4. The project template must be created in the openshift-config namespace. Load
your modified template:

```terminal
$ oc create -f template.yaml -n openshift-config
```

5. Edit the project configuration resource using the web console or CLI.
* Using the web console:
1. Navigate to the Administration -> Cluster Settings page.
2. Click Configuration to view all configuration resources.
3. Find the entry for Project and click Edit YAML.
* Using the CLI:
1. Edit the project.config.openshift.io/cluster resource:

```terminal
$ oc edit project.config.openshift.io/cluster
```

6. Update the spec section to include the projectRequestTemplate and name
parameters, and set the name of your uploaded project template. The default name
is project-request.
Project configuration resource with custom project template

```yaml
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Project
metadata:
# ...
spec:
  projectRequestTemplate:
    name: <template_name>
# ...
```

7. After you save your changes, create a new project to verify that your changes
were successfully applied.

# Disabling project self-provisioning

You can prevent an authenticated user group from self-provisioning new projects.

1. Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
2. View the self-provisioners cluster role binding usage by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc describe clusterrolebinding.rbac self-provisioners
```

Example output

```terminal
Name:		self-provisioners
Labels:		<none>
Annotations:	rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate=true
Role:
  Kind:	ClusterRole
  Name:	self-provisioner
Subjects:
  Kind	Name				Namespace
  ----	----				---------
  Group	system:authenticated:oauth
```


Review the subjects in the self-provisioners section.
3. Remove the self-provisioner cluster role from the group system:authenticated:oauth.
* If the self-provisioners cluster role binding binds only the self-provisioner role to the system:authenticated:oauth group, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc patch clusterrolebinding.rbac self-provisioners -p '{"subjects": null}'
```

* If the self-provisioners cluster role binding binds the self-provisioner role to more users, groups, or service accounts than the system:authenticated:oauth group, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc adm policy \
    remove-cluster-role-from-group self-provisioner \
    system:authenticated:oauth
```

4. Edit the self-provisioners cluster role binding to prevent automatic updates to the role. Automatic updates reset the cluster roles to the default state.
* To update the role binding using the CLI:
1. Run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc edit clusterrolebinding.rbac self-provisioners
```

2. In the displayed role binding, set the rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate parameter value to false, as shown in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: authorization.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  annotations:
    rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate: "false"
# ...
```

* To update the role binding by using a single command:

```terminal
$ oc patch clusterrolebinding.rbac self-provisioners -p '{ "metadata": { "annotations": { "rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate": "false" } } }'
```

5. Log in as an authenticated user and verify that it can no longer self-provision a project:

```terminal
$ oc new-project test
```

Example output

```terminal
Error from server (Forbidden): You may not request a new project via this API.
```


Consider customizing this project request message to provide more helpful instructions specific to your organization.

# Customizing the project request message

When a developer or a service account that is unable to self-provision projects
makes a project creation request using the web console or CLI, the following
error message is returned by default:


```terminal
You may not request a new project via this API.
```


Cluster administrators can customize this message. Consider updating it to
provide further instructions on how to request a new project specific to your
organization. For example:

* To request a project, contact your system administrator at
projectname@example.com.
* To request a new project, fill out the project request form located at
https://internal.example.com/openshift-project-request.

To customize the project request message:

1. Edit the project configuration resource using the web console or CLI.
* Using the web console:
1. Navigate to the Administration -> Cluster Settings page.
2. Click Configuration to view all configuration resources.
3. Find the entry for Project and click Edit YAML.
* Using the CLI:
1. Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
2. Edit the project.config.openshift.io/cluster resource:

```terminal
$ oc edit project.config.openshift.io/cluster
```

2. Update the spec section to include the projectRequestMessage parameter and
set the value to your custom message:
Project configuration resource with custom project request message

```yaml
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Project
metadata:
# ...
spec:
  projectRequestMessage: <message_string>
# ...
```


For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Project
metadata:
# ...
spec:
  projectRequestMessage: To request a project, contact your system administrator at projectname@example.com.
# ...
```

3. After you save your changes, attempt to create a new project as a developer or
service account that is unable to self-provision projects to verify that your
changes were successfully applied.
