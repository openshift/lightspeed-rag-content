# Working with projects


A project allows a community of users to organize and manage their content in
isolation from other communities.

[NOTE]
----
Projects starting with openshift- and kube- are
default projects.
These projects host cluster components that run as pods and other infrastructure components. As such, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform does not allow you to create projects starting with openshift- or kube- using the oc new-project command.
Cluster administrators can create these projects using the oc adm new-project command.
----

[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not run workloads in or share access to default projects. Default projects are reserved for running core cluster components.
The following default projects are considered highly privileged: default, kube-public, kube-system, openshift, openshift-infra, openshift-node, and other system-created projects that have the openshift.io/run-level label set to 0 or 1. Functionality that relies on admission plugins, such as pod security admission, security context constraints, cluster resource quotas, and image reference resolution, does not work in highly privileged projects.
----

# Creating a project

You can use the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console or the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) to create a project in your cluster.

## Creating a project by using the web console

You can use the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console to create a project in your cluster.


[NOTE]
----
Projects starting with openshift- and kube- are considered critical by Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. As such, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform does not allow you to create projects starting with openshift- using the web console.

## Creating a project by using the CLI

If allowed by your cluster administrator, you can create a new project.


[NOTE]
----
Projects starting with openshift- and kube- are considered critical by Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. As such, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform does not allow you to create Projects starting with openshift- or kube- using the oc new-project command.
Cluster administrators can create these projects using the oc adm new-project command.

* Run:

```terminal
$ oc new-project <project_name> \
    --description="<description>" --display-name="<display_name>"
```


For example:

```terminal
$ oc new-project hello-openshift \
    --description="This is an example project" \
    --display-name="Hello OpenShift"

# Viewing a project

You can use the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console or the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) to view a project in your cluster.

## Viewing a project by using the web console

You can view the projects that you have access to by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Starting with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19, the perspectives in the web console have unified. The Developer perspective is no longer enabled by default.
All users can interact with all
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
web console features. However, if you are not the cluster owner, you might need to request permission to certain features from the cluster owner.
You can still enable the Developer perspective. On the Getting Started pane in the web console, you can take a tour of the console, find information on setting up your cluster, view a quick start for enabling the Developer perspective, and follow links to explore new features and capabilities.
----

* If you are logged in as an administrator:
1. Navigate to Home -> Projects in the navigation menu.
2. Select a project to view. The Overview tab includes a dashboard for your project.
3. Select the Details tab to view the project details.
4. Select the YAML tab to view and update the YAML configuration for the project resource.
5. Select the Workloads tab to see workloads in the project.
6. Select the RoleBindings tab to view and create role bindings for your project.
* If you are logged in as a developer:
1. Navigate to the Project page in the navigation menu.
2. Select All Projects from the Project drop-down menu at the top of the screen to list all of the projects in your cluster.
3. Select a project to view.
4. Select the Details tab to view the project details.
5. If you have adequate permissions for a project, select the Project access tab view and update the privileges for the project.

## Viewing a project using the CLI

When viewing projects, you are restricted to seeing only the projects you have
access to view based on the authorization policy.

1. To view a list of projects, run:

```terminal
$ oc get projects
```

2. You can change from the current project to a different project for CLI
operations. The specified project is then used in all subsequent operations that
manipulate project-scoped content:

```terminal
$ oc project <project_name>
```


# Providing access permissions to your project using the Developer perspective

You can use the Project view in the Developer perspective to grant or revoke access permissions to your project.

# Customizing the available cluster roles using the web console

In the Developer perspective of the web console, the Project &#8594; Project access page enables a project administrator to grant roles to users in a project. By default, the available cluster roles that can be granted to users in a project are admin, edit, and view.

As a cluster administrator, you can define which cluster roles are available in the Project access page for all projects cluster-wide. You can specify the available roles by customizing the spec.customization.projectAccess.availableClusterRoles object in the Console configuration resource.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

1. In the Administrator perspective, navigate to Administration -> Cluster settings.
2. Click the Configuration tab.
3. From the Configuration resource list, select Console operator.openshift.io.
4. Navigate to the YAML tab to view and edit the YAML code.
5. In the YAML code under spec, customize the list of available cluster roles for project access. The following example specifies the default admin, edit, and view roles:

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Console
metadata:
  name: cluster
# ...
spec:
  customization:
    projectAccess:
      availableClusterRoles:
      - admin
      - edit
      - view
```

6. Click Save to save the changes to the Console configuration resource.

1. In the Developer perspective, navigate to the Project page.
2. Select a project from the Project menu.
3. Select the Project access tab.
4. Click the menu in the Role column and verify that the available roles match the configuration that you applied to the Console resource configuration.
