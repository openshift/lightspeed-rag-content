# Using the Red Hat Marketplace


The Red Hat Marketplace is an open cloud marketplace that makes it easy to discover and access certified software for container-based environments that run on public clouds and on-premise.

# Red Hat Marketplace features

Cluster administrators can use the Red Hat Marketplace to manage software on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, give developers self-service access to deploy application instances, and correlate application usage against a quota.

## Connect Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters to the Marketplace

Cluster administrators can install a common set of applications on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters that connect to the Marketplace. They can also use the Marketplace to track cluster usage against subscriptions or quotas. Users that they add by using the Marketplace have their product usage tracked and billed to their organization.

During the cluster connection process,
a Marketplace Operator is installed that updates the image registry secret, manages the catalog, and reports application usage.

## Install applications

Cluster administrators can install Marketplace applications from within OperatorHub in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, or from the Marketplace web application.

You can access installed applications from the web console by clicking Operators > Installed Operators.

## Deploy applications from different perspectives

Developers can access newly installed capabilities and deploy Marketplace applications from the web console.

For example, after a database Operator is installed, a developer can create an instance from the catalog within their project. Database usage is aggregated and reported to the cluster administrator.

Cluster administrators can access Operator installation and application usage information. They can also launch application instances by browsing custom resource definitions (CRDs) in the Installed Operators list.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Starting with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.19, the perspectives in the web console have unified. The Developer perspective is no longer enabled by default.
All users can interact with all
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
web console features. However, if you are not the cluster owner, you might need to request permission to certain features from the cluster owner.
You can still enable the Developer perspective. On the Getting Started pane in the web console, you can take a tour of the console, find information on setting up your cluster, view a quick start for enabling the Developer perspective, and follow links to explore new features and capabilities.
