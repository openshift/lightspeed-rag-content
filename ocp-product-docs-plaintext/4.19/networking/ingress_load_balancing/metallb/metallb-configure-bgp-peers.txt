# Configuring MetalLB BGP peers


To establish BGP sessions and advertise routes for load balancer services, configure MetalLB Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) peer custom resources (CRs). Defining these peers ensures that your network infrastructure receives accurate routing information to reach cluster application workloads.
You can add, modify, and delete BGP peers. The MetalLB Operator uses the BGP peer custom resources to identify the peers that MetalLB speaker pods contact to start BGP sessions. The peers receive the route advertisements for the load-balancer IP addresses that MetalLB assigns to services.

# About the BGP peer custom resource

To establish network connectivity and advertise routes for load-balancer services, configure the properties of the MetalLB Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) peer custom resource (CR). Establishing these parameters ensures that your cluster authorizes specific routing peers to direct external traffic correctly to your application workloads.

The following table describes the parameters for the BGP peer CR:




[NOTE]
----
The passwordSecret parameter is mutually exclusive with the password parameter, and contains a reference to a secret containing the password to use. Setting both parameters results in a failure of the parsing.

# Configuring a BGP peer

To exchange routing information and advertise IP addresses for load balancer services, configure MetalLB BGP peer CRs. Establishing these peers ensures that your network infrastructure can reach and correctly route traffic to cluster application workloads.

You can add a BGP peer custom resource to exchange routing information with network routers and advertise the IP addresses for services.

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* Configure MetalLB with a BGP advertisement.

1. Create a file, such as bgppeer.yaml, with content like the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta2
kind: BGPPeer
metadata:
  namespace: metallb-system
  name: doc-example-peer
spec:
  peerAddress: 10.0.0.1
  peerASN: 64501
  myASN: 64500
  routerID: 10.10.10.10
# ...
```

2. Apply the BGP peer configuration by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f bgppeer.yaml
```


# Configure a specific set of BGP peers for a given address pool

To assign specific IP address pools to designated BGP peers, configure MetalLB BGP advertisements. Establishing these mappings ensures that your cluster advertises designated network ranges only to authorized routing peers for precise external traffic control.

This procedure demonstrates the following tasks:

* Configure a set of address pools: pool1 and pool2.
* Configure a set of BGP peers: peer1 and peer2.
* Configure BGP advertisement to assign pool1 to peer1 and pool2 to peer2.

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

# Exposing a service through a network VRF

To isolate network traffic and manage multiple routing tables, expose a service through a virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) instance. Associating a VRF with a MetalLB BGP peer ensures that external traffic is segmented and correctly routed to the intended application workloads.


[IMPORTANT]
----
{FeatureName} is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
----

By using a VRF on a network interface to expose a service through a BGP peer, you can segregate traffic to the service, configure independent routing decisions, and enable multi-tenancy support on a network interface.


[NOTE]
----
By establishing a BGP session through an interface belonging to a network VRF, MetalLB can advertise services through that interface and enable external traffic to reach the service through this interface. However, the network VRF routing table is different from the default VRF routing table used by OVN-Kubernetes. Therefore, the traffic cannot reach the OVN-Kubernetes network infrastructure.
To enable the traffic directed to the service to reach the OVN-Kubernetes network infrastructure, you must configure routing rules to define the next hops for network traffic. See the NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy resource in "Managing symmetric routing with MetalLB" in the Additional resources section for more information.
----

The following high-level steps demonstrate how to expose a service through a network VRF with a BGP peer:

1. Define a BGP peer and add a network VRF instance.
2. Specify an IP address pool for MetalLB.
3. Configure a BGP route advertisement for MetalLB to advertise a route by using the specified IP address pool and the BGP peer associated with the VRF instance.
4. Deploy a service to test the configuration.

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You logged in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* You defined a NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy (NNCP) to associate a Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) instance with a network interface. For more information about completing this prerequisite, see the Additional resources section.
* You installed MetalLB on your cluster.

1. Create a BGPPeer custom resource (CR):
1. Create a file, such as frrviavrf.yaml, with content like the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta2
kind: BGPPeer
metadata:
  name: frrviavrf
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  myASN: 100
  peerASN: 200
  peerAddress: 192.168.130.1
  vrf: ens4vrf
# ...
```


spec.vrf: Specifies the network VRF instance to associate with the BGP peer. MetalLB can advertise services and make routing decisions based on the routing information in the VRF.

[NOTE]
----
You must configure this network VRF instance in a NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy CR. See the Additional resources for more information.
----
2. Apply the configuration for the BGP peer by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f frrviavrf.yaml
```

2. Create an IPAddressPool CR:
1. Create a file, such as first-pool.yaml, with content like the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  name: first-pool
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
  - 192.169.10.0/32
# ...
```

2. Apply the configuration for the IP address pool by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f first-pool.yaml
```

3. Create a BGPAdvertisement CR:
1. Create a file, such as first-adv.yaml, with content like the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: BGPAdvertisement
metadata:
  name: first-adv
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  ipAddressPools:
    - first-pool
  peers:
    - frrviavrf
# ...
```


peers.frrviavrf: In this example, MetalLB advertises a range of IP addresses from the first-pool IP address pool to the frrviavrf BGP peer.
2. Apply the configuration for the BGP advertisement by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f first-adv.yaml
```

4. Create a Namespace, Deployment, and Service CR:
1. Create a file, such as deploy-service.yaml, with content like the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: test
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: server
  namespace: test
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: server
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: server
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: server
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - name: http
          containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: server1
  namespace: test
spec:
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: server
  type: LoadBalancer
# ...
```

2. Apply the configuration for the namespace, deployment, and service by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f deploy-service.yaml
```


1. Identify a MetalLB speaker pod by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get -n metallb-system pods -l component=speaker
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
speaker-c6c5f   6/6     Running   0          69m
```

2. Verify that the state of the BGP session is Established in the speaker pod by running the following command, replacing the variables to match your configuration:

```terminal
$ oc exec -n metallb-system <speaker_pod> -c frr -- vtysh -c "show bgp vrf <vrf_name> neigh"
```

Example output

```terminal
BGP neighbor is 192.168.30.1, remote AS 200, local AS 100, external link
  BGP version 4, remote router ID 192.168.30.1, local router ID 192.168.30.71
  BGP state = Established, up for 04:20:09

...
```

3. Verify that the service is advertised correctly by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc exec -n metallb-system <speaker_pod> -c frr -- vtysh -c "show bgp vrf <vrf_name> ipv4"
```

# Example BGP peer configurations

To precisely manage network topology and improve routing resilience, configure MetalLB BGP peer settings that limit node connectivity and incorporate BFD profiles. Defining these parameters ensures that your cluster maintains secure peer relationships and rapidly detects path failures for high service availability.

Example of limiting which nodes connect to a BGP peer:: You can specify the nodeSelectors parameter to control which nodes can connect to a BGP peer.


```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta2
kind: BGPPeer
metadata:
  name: doc-example-nodesel
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  peerAddress: 10.0.20.1
  peerASN: 64501
  myASN: 64500
  nodeSelectors:
  - matchExpressions:
    - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
      operator: In
      values: [compute-1.example.com, compute-2.example.com]
# ...
```


Example of specifying a BFD profile for a BGP peer:: You can specify a BFD profile to associate with BGP peers. BFD complements BGP by providing faster detection of communication failures between peers than BGP alone.


```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta2
kind: BGPPeer
metadata:
  name: doc-example-peer-bfd
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  peerAddress: 10.0.20.1
  peerASN: 64501
  myASN: 64500
  holdTime: "10s"
  bfdProfile: doc-example-bfd-profile-full
# ...
```



[NOTE]
----
Deleting the bidirectional forwarding detection (BFD) profile and removing the bfdProfile added to the border gateway protocol (BGP) peer resource does not disable the BFD. Instead, the BGP peer starts using the default BFD profile. To disable BFD from a BGP peer resource, delete the BGP peer configuration and recreate it without a BFD profile. For more information, see BZ#2050824.
----

Example of specifying BGP peers for dual-stack networking:: To support dual-stack networking, add one BGP peer custom resource for IPv4 and one BGP peer custom resource for IPv6.


```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta2
kind: BGPPeer
metadata:
  name: doc-example-dual-stack-ipv4
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  peerAddress: 10.0.20.1
  peerASN: 64500
  myASN: 64500
---
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta2
kind: BGPPeer
metadata:
  name: doc-example-dual-stack-ipv6
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  peerAddress: 2620:52:0:88::104
  peerASN: 64500
  myASN: 64500
# ...
```

{FeatureName} is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
----

To configure unnumbered BGP peering, specify the interface in the spec.interface field by using the following example configuration:


```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta2
kind: BGPPeer
metadata:
  name: peer-unnumber
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  myASN: 64512
  ASN: 645000
  interface: net0
# ...
```



[NOTE]
----
To use the interface parameter, you must establish a point-to-point layer 2 connection between the two BGP peers.
You can use unnumbered BGP peering with IPv4, IPv6, or dual-stack, but you must enable IPv6 Router Advertisements (RAs).
Each interface is limited to one BGP connection.
If you use this parameter, you cannot specify a value in the spec.bgp.routers.neighbors.address parameter.
