# Configuring ingress cluster traffic for a service external IP


You can use either a MetalLB implementation or an IP failover deployment to attach an ExternalIP resource to a service so that the service is available to traffic outside your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. Hosting an external IP address in this way is only applicable for a cluster installed on bare-metal hardware.
You must ensure that you correctly configure the external network infrastructure to route traffic to the service.

# Prerequisites

* Your cluster is configured with ExternalIPs enabled. For more information, read Configuring ExternalIPs for services.

[NOTE]
----
Do not use the same ExternalIP for the egress IP.

# Attaching an ExternalIP to a service

You can attach an ExternalIP resource to a service. If you configured your cluster to automatically attach the resource to a service, you might not need to manually attach an ExternalIP to the service.

The examples in the procedure use a scenario that manually attaches an ExternalIP resource to a service in a cluster with an IP failover configuration.

1. Confirm compatible IP address ranges for the ExternalIP resource by entering the following command in your CLI:

```terminal
$ oc get networks.config cluster -o jsonpath='{.spec.externalIP}{"\n"}'
```


[NOTE]
----
If autoAssignCIDRs is set and you did not specify a value for spec.externalIPs in the ExternalIP resource, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform automatically assigns ExternalIP to a new Service object.
----
2. Choose one of the following options to attach an ExternalIP resource to the service:
1. If you are creating a new service, specify a value in the spec.externalIPs field and array of one or more valid IP addresses in the allowedCIDRs parameter.
Example of service YAML configuration file that supports an ExternalIP resource

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: svc-with-externalip
spec:
  externalIPs:
    policy:
      allowedCIDRs:
      - 192.168.123.0/28
```

2. If you are attaching an ExternalIP to an existing service, enter the following command. Replace <name> with the service name. Replace <ip_address> with a valid ExternalIP address. You can provide multiple IP addresses separated by commas.

```terminal
$ oc patch svc <name> -p \
  '{
    "spec": {
      "externalIPs": [ "<ip_address>" ]
    }
  }'
```


For example:

```terminal
$ oc patch svc mysql-55-rhel7 -p '{"spec":{"externalIPs":["192.174.120.10"]}}'
```

Example output

```terminal
"mysql-55-rhel7" patched
```

3. To confirm that an ExternalIP address is attached to the service, enter the following command. If you specified an ExternalIP for a new service, you must create the service first.

```terminal
$ oc get svc
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME               CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)    AGE
mysql-55-rhel7     172.30.131.89   192.174.120.10  3306/TCP   13m
```
