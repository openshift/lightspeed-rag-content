# Configuring ingress cluster traffic overview


Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform provides the following methods for communicating from
outside the cluster with services running in the cluster.
The methods are recommended, in order or preference:
* If you have HTTP/HTTPS, use an Ingress Controller.
* If you have a TLS-encrypted protocol other than HTTPS. For example, for TLS
with the SNI header, use an Ingress Controller.
* Otherwise, use a Load Balancer, an External IP, or a NodePort.

# Comparision: Fault tolerant access to external IP addresses

For the communication methods that provide access to an external IP address, fault tolerant access to the IP address is another consideration.
The following features provide fault tolerant access to an external IP address.

IP failover:: IP failover manages a pool of virtual IP address for a set of nodes.
It is implemented with Keepalived and Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP).
IP failover is a layer 2 mechanism only and relies on multicast.
Multicast can have disadvantages for some networks.
MetalLB:: MetalLB has a layer 2 mode, but it does not use multicast.
Layer 2 mode has a disadvantage that it transfers all traffic for an external IP address through one node.
Manually assigning external IP addresses:: You can configure your cluster with an IP address block that is used to assign external IP addresses to services.
By default, this feature is disabled.
This feature is flexible, but places the largest burden on the cluster or network administrator.
The cluster is prepared to receive traffic that is destined for the external IP, but each customer has to decide how they want to route traffic to nodes.
