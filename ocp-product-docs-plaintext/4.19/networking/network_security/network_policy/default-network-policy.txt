# Defining a default network policy for projects


As a cluster administrator, you can modify the new project template to automatically include network policies when you create a new project. If you do not yet have a customized template for new projects, you must first create one.

# Modifying the template for new projects

As a cluster administrator, you can modify the default project template so that new projects are created using your custom requirements.

To create your own custom project template:

* You have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster using an account with cluster-admin permissions.

1. Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
2. Generate the default project template:

```terminal
$ oc adm create-bootstrap-project-template -o yaml > template.yaml
```

3. Use a text editor to modify the generated template.yaml file by adding
objects or modifying existing objects.
4. The project template must be created in the openshift-config namespace. Load
your modified template:

```terminal
$ oc create -f template.yaml -n openshift-config
```

5. Edit the project configuration resource using the web console or CLI.
* Using the web console:
1. Navigate to the Administration -> Cluster Settings page.
2. Click Configuration to view all configuration resources.
3. Find the entry for Project and click Edit YAML.
* Using the CLI:
1. Edit the project.config.openshift.io/cluster resource:

```terminal
$ oc edit project.config.openshift.io/cluster
```

6. Update the spec section to include the projectRequestTemplate and name
parameters, and set the name of your uploaded project template. The default name
is project-request.
Project configuration resource with custom project template

```yaml
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Project
metadata:
# ...
spec:
  projectRequestTemplate:
    name: <template_name>
# ...
```

7. After you save your changes, create a new project to verify that your changes
were successfully applied.

# Adding network policies to the new project template

As a cluster administrator, you can add network policies to the default template for new projects.
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform will automatically create all the NetworkPolicy objects specified in the template in the project.

* Your cluster uses a default container network interface (CNI) network plugin that supports NetworkPolicy objects, such as the OVN-Kubernetes.
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You must log in to the cluster with a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* You must have created a custom default project template for new projects.

1. Edit the default template for a new project by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc edit template <project_template> -n openshift-config
```


Replace <project_template> with the name of the default template that you configured for your cluster. The default template name is project-request.
2. In the template, add each NetworkPolicy object as an element to the objects parameter. The objects parameter accepts a collection of one or more objects.

In the following example, the objects parameter collection includes several NetworkPolicy objects.

```yaml
objects:
- apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: NetworkPolicy
  metadata:
    name: allow-from-same-namespace
  spec:
    podSelector: {}
    ingress:
    - from:
      - podSelector: {}
- apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: NetworkPolicy
  metadata:
    name: allow-from-openshift-ingress
  spec:
    ingress:
    - from:
      - namespaceSelector:
          matchLabels:
            policy-group.network.openshift.io/ingress:
    podSelector: {}
    policyTypes:
    - Ingress
- apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: NetworkPolicy
  metadata:
    name: allow-from-kube-apiserver-operator
  spec:
    ingress:
    - from:
      - namespaceSelector:
          matchLabels:
            kubernetes.io/metadata.name: openshift-kube-apiserver-operator
        podSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app: kube-apiserver-operator
    policyTypes:
    - Ingress
...
```

3. Optional: Create a new project and confirm the successful creation of your network policy objects.
1. Create a new project:

```terminal
$ oc new-project <project> 1
```

Replace <project> with the name for the project you are creating.
2. Confirm that the network policy objects in the new project template exist in the new project:

```terminal
$ oc get networkpolicy
```


Expected output:

```terminal
NAME                           POD-SELECTOR   AGE
allow-from-openshift-ingress   <none>         7s
allow-from-same-namespace      <none>         7s
```
