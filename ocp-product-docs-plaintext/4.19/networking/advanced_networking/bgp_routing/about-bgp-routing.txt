# About BGP routing


This feature provides native Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing capabilities for the cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
----
If you are using the MetalLB Operator and there are existing FRRConfiguration CRs in the metallb-system namespace created by cluster administrators or third-party cluster components other than the MetalLB Operator, you must ensure that they are copied to the openshift-frr-k8s namespace or that those third-party cluster components use the new namespace. For more information, see Migrating FRR-K8s resources.

# About Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform supports BGP routing through FRRouting (FRR), a free, open source internet routing protocol suite for Linux, UNIX, and similar operating systems. FRR-K8s is a Kubernetes-based daemon set that exposes a subset of the FRR API in a Kubernetes-compliant manner. As a cluster administrator, you can use the FRRConfiguration custom resource (CR) to access FRR services.

## Supported platforms

BGP routing is supported on the following infrastructure types:

* Bare metal

BGP routing requires that you have properly configured BGP for your network provider. Outages or misconfigurations of your network provider might cause disruptions to your cluster network.

## Considerations for use with the MetalLB Operator

The MetalLB Operator is installed as an add-on to the cluster. Deployment of the MetalLB Operator automatically enables FRR-K8s as an additional routing capability provider and uses the FRR-K8s daemon installed by this feature.

Before upgrading to 4.18, any existing FRRConfiguration in the metallb-system namespace not managed by the MetalLB operator (added by a cluster administrator or any other component) needs to be copied to the openshift-frr-k8s namespace manually, creating the namespace if necessary.


[IMPORTANT]
----
If you are using the MetalLB Operator and there are existing FRRConfiguration CRs in the metallb-system namespace created by cluster administrators or third-party cluster components other than MetalLB Operator, you must:
* Ensure that these existing FRRConfiguration CRs are copied to the openshift-frr-k8s namespace.
* Ensure that the third-party cluster components use the new namespace for the FRRConfiguration CRs that they create.

## Cluster Network Operator configuration

The Cluster Network Operator API exposes the following API field to configure BGP routing:

* spec.additionalRoutingCapabilities: Enables deployment of the FRR-K8s daemon for the cluster, which can be used independently of route advertisements. When enabled, the FRR-K8s daemon is deployed on all nodes.

## BGP routing custom resources

The following custom resources are used to configure BGP routing:

FRRConfiguration:: This custom resource defines the FRR configuration for the BGP routing. This CR is namespaced.

# Configuring the FRRConfiguration CRD

To customize routing behavior beyond standard MetalLB capabilities, configure the FRRConfiguration custom resource (CR).

The following reference examples demonstrate how to define specific FRRouting (FRR) parameters to enable advanced services, such as receiving routes:

The routers parameter:: You can use the routers parameter to configure multiple routers, one for each Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) resource. For each router, you must define the Autonomous System Number (ASN).

You can also define a list of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) neighbors to connect to, as in the following example:


```yaml
apiVersion: frrk8s.metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: FRRConfiguration
metadata:
  name: test
  namespace: frr-k8s-system
spec:
  bgp:
    routers:
    - asn: 64512
      neighbors:
      - address: 172.30.0.3
        asn: 4200000000
        ebgpMultiHop: true
        port: 180
      - address: 172.18.0.6
        asn: 4200000000
        port: 179
# ...
```


The toAdvertise parameter:: By default, FRR-K8s does not advertise the prefixes configured as part of a router configuration. To advertise the prefixes, you use the toAdvertise parameter.

You can advertise a subset of the prefixes, as in the following example:


```yaml
apiVersion: frrk8s.metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: FRRConfiguration
metadata:
  name: test
  namespace: frr-k8s-system
spec:
  bgp:
    routers:
    - asn: 64512
      neighbors:
      - address: 172.30.0.3
        asn: 4200000000
        ebgpMultiHop: true
        port: 180
        toAdvertise:
          allowed:
            prefixes:
            - 192.168.2.0/24
      prefixes:
        - 192.168.2.0/24
        - 192.169.2.0/24
# ...
```


* allowed.prefixes: Advertises a subset of prefixes.

The following example shows you how to advertise all of the prefixes:


```yaml
apiVersion: frrk8s.metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: FRRConfiguration
metadata:
  name: test
  namespace: frr-k8s-system
spec:
  bgp:
    routers:
    - asn: 64512
      neighbors:
      - address: 172.30.0.3
        asn: 4200000000
        ebgpMultiHop: true
        port: 180
        toAdvertise:
          allowed:
            mode: all
      prefixes:
        - 192.168.2.0/24
        - 192.169.2.0/24
# ...
```


* allowed.mode: Advertises all prefixes.
The toReceive parameter:: By default, FRR-K8s does not process any prefixes advertised by a neighbor. You can use the toReceive parameter to process such addresses.

You can configure for a subset of the prefixes, as in this example:


```yaml
apiVersion: frrk8s.metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: FRRConfiguration
metadata:
  name: test
  namespace: frr-k8s-system
spec:
  bgp:
    routers:
    - asn: 64512
      neighbors:
      - address: 172.18.0.5
          asn: 64512
          port: 179
          toReceive:
            allowed:
              prefixes:
              - prefix: 192.168.1.0/24
              - prefix: 192.169.2.0/24
                ge: 25
                le: 28
# ...
```


* prefixes: The prefix is applied if the prefix length is less than or equal to the le prefix length and greater than or equal to the ge prefix length.

The following example configures FRR to handle all the prefixes announced:


```yaml
apiVersion: frrk8s.metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: FRRConfiguration
metadata:
  name: test
  namespace: frr-k8s-system
spec:
  bgp:
    routers:
    - asn: 64512
      neighbors:
      - address: 172.18.0.5
          asn: 64512
          port: 179
          toReceive:
            allowed:
              mode: all
# ...
```


The bgp parameter:: You can use the bgp parameter to define various BFD profiles and associate them with a neighbor. In the following example, BFD backs up the BGP session and FRR can detect link failures:


```yaml
apiVersion: frrk8s.metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: FRRConfiguration
metadata:
  name: test
  namespace: frr-k8s-system
spec:
  bgp:
    routers:
    - asn: 64512
      neighbors:
      - address: 172.30.0.3
        asn: 64512
        port: 180
        bfdProfile: defaultprofile
    bfdProfiles:
      - name: defaultprofile
# ...
```


The nodeSelector parameter:: By default, FRR-K8s applies the configuration to all nodes where the daemon is running.
You can use the nodeSelector parameter to specify the nodes to which you want to apply the configuration. For example:


```yaml
apiVersion: frrk8s.metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: FRRConfiguration
metadata:
  name: test
  namespace: frr-k8s-system
spec:
  bgp:
    routers:
    - asn: 64512
  nodeSelector:
    labelSelector:
    foo: "bar"
# ...
```


The interface parameter:: :_mod-docs-content-type: SNIPPET

You can use the interface field to configure unnumbered BGP peering by using the following example configuration:


```yaml
apiVersion: frrk8s.metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: FRRConfiguration
metadata:
  name: test
  namespace: frr-k8s-system
spec:
  bgp:
    bfdProfiles:
    - echoMode: false
      name: simple
      passiveMode: false
    routers:
    - asn: 64512
      neighbors:
      - asn: 64512
        bfdProfile: simple
        disableMP: false
        interface: net10
        port: 179
        toAdvertise:
          allowed:
            mode: filtered
            prefixes:
            - 5.5.5.5/32
        toReceive:
          allowed:
            mode: filtered
      prefixes:
      - 5.5.5.5/32
# ...
```


* neighbors.interface: Activates unnumbered BGP peering.


[NOTE]
----
To use the interface parameter, you must establish a point-to-point, layer 2 connection between the two BGP peers. You can use unnumbered BGP peering with IPv4, IPv6, or dual-stack, but you must enable IPv6 RAs (Router Advertisements). Each interface is limited to one BGP connection.
If you use this parameter, you cannot specify a value in the spec.bgp.routers.neighbors.address parameter.
