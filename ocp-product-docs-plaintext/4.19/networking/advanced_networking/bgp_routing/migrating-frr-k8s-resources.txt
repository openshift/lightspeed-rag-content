# Migrating FRR-K8s resources


All user-created FRR-K8s custom resources (CRs) in the metallb-system namespace under Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.17 and earlier releases must be migrated to the openshift-frr-k8s namespace. As a cluster administrator, complete the steps in this procedure to migrate your FRR-K8s custom resources.

# Migrating FRR-K8s resources

You can migrate the FRR-K8s FRRConfiguration custom resources from the metallb-system namespace to the openshift-frr-k8s namespace.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You are logged in to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

When upgrading from an earlier version of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform with the Metal LB Operator deployed, you must manually migrate your custom FRRConfiguration configurations from the metallb-system namespace to the openshift-frr-k8s namespace. To move these CRs, enter the following commands:

1. To create the openshift-frr-k8s namespace, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create namespace openshift-frr-k8s
```

2. To automate the migration, create a shell script named migrate.sh with the following contents:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
OLD_NAMESPACE="metallb-system"
NEW_NAMESPACE="openshift-frr-k8s"
FILTER_OUT="metallb-"
oc get frrconfigurations.frrk8s.metallb.io -n "${OLD_NAMESPACE}" -o json |\
  jq -r '.items[] | select(.metadata.name | test("'"${FILTER_OUT}"'") | not)' |\
  jq -r '.metadata.namespace = "'"${NEW_NAMESPACE}"'"' |\
  oc create -f -
```

3. To execute the migration, run the following command:

```terminal
$ bash migrate.sh
```


* To confirm that the migration succeeded, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get frrconfigurations.frrk8s.metallb.io -n openshift-frr-k8s
```


After the migration is complete, you can remove the FRRConfiguration custom resources from the metallb-system namespace.
