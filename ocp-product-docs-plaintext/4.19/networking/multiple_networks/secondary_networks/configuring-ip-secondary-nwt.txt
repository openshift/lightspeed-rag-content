# Configuring IP address assignment on secondary networks


The following sections give instructions and information for how to configure IP address assignments for secondary networks.

# Configuration of IP address assignment for a network attachment

For secondary networks, IP addresses can be assigned using an IP Address Management (IPAM) CNI plugin, which supports various assignment methods, including Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and static assignment.

The DHCP IPAM CNI plugin responsible for dynamic assignment of IP addresses operates with two distinct components:

* CNI Plugin: Responsible for integrating with the Kubernetes networking stack to request and release IP addresses.
* DHCP IPAM CNI Daemon: A listener for DHCP events that coordinates with existing DHCP servers in the environment to handle IP address assignment requests. This daemon is not a DHCP server itself.

For networks requiring type: dhcp in their IPAM configuration, ensure the following:

* A DHCP server is available and running in the environment. The DHCP server is external to the cluster and is expected to be part of the customer's existing network infrastructure.
* The DHCP server is appropriately configured to serve IP addresses to the nodes.

In cases where a DHCP server is unavailable in the environment, it is recommended to use the Whereabouts IPAM CNI plugin instead. The Whereabouts CNI provides similar IP address management capabilities without the need for an external DHCP server.


[NOTE]
----
Use the Whereabouts CNI plugin when there is no external DHCP server or where static IP address management is preferred. The Whereabouts plugin includes a reconciler daemon to manage stale IP address allocations.
----

A DHCP lease must be periodically renewed throughout the container&#8217;s lifetime, so a separate daemon, the DHCP IPAM CNI Daemon, is required. To deploy the DHCP IPAM CNI daemon, modify the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) configuration to trigger the deployment of this daemon as part of the secondary network setup.

## Static IP address assignment configuration

The following table describes the configuration for static IP address assignment:



The addresses array requires objects with the following fields:








```json
{
  "ipam": {
    "type": "static",
      "addresses": [
        {
          "address": "191.168.1.7/24"
        }
      ]
  }
}
```


## Dynamic IP address (DHCP) assignment configuration

A pod obtains its original DHCP lease when it is created. The lease must be periodically renewed by a minimal DHCP server deployment running on the cluster.


[IMPORTANT]
----
For an Ethernet network attachment, the SR-IOV Network Operator does not create a DHCP server deployment; the Cluster Network Operator is responsible for creating the minimal DHCP server deployment.
----

To trigger the deployment of the DHCP server, you must create a shim network attachment by editing the Cluster Network Operator configuration, as in the following example:


```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  additionalNetworks:
  - name: dhcp-shim
    namespace: default
    type: Raw
    rawCNIConfig: |-
      {
        "name": "dhcp-shim",
        "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
        "type": "bridge",
        "ipam": {
          "type": "dhcp"
        }
      }
  # ...
```


The following table describes the configuration parameters for dynamic IP address address assignment with DHCP.



The following JSON example describes the configuration p for dynamic IP address address assignment with DHCP.


```json
{
  "ipam": {
    "type": "dhcp"
  }
}
```


## Dynamic IP address assignment configuration with Whereabouts

The Whereabouts CNI plugin helps the dynamic assignment of an IP address to a secondary network without the use of a DHCP server.

The Whereabouts CNI plugin also supports overlapping IP address ranges and configuration of the same CIDR range multiple times within separate NetworkAttachmentDefinition CRDs. This provides greater flexibility and management capabilities in multi-tenant environments.

### Dynamic IP address configuration parameters

The following table describes the configuration objects for dynamic IP address assignment with Whereabouts:



### Dynamic IP address assignment configuration with Whereabouts that excludes IP address ranges

The following example shows a dynamic address assignment configuration in a NAD file that uses Whereabouts:


```json
{
  "ipam": {
    "type": "whereabouts",
    "range": "192.0.2.192/27",
    "exclude": [
       "192.0.2.192/30",
       "192.0.2.196/32"
    ]
  }
}
```


### Dynamic IP address assignment that uses Whereabouts with overlapping IP address ranges

The following example shows a dynamic IP address assignment that uses overlapping IP address ranges for multi-tenant networks.


```json
{
  "ipam": {
    "type": "whereabouts",
    "range": "192.0.2.192/29",
    "network_name": "example_net_common", 1
  }
}
```


Optional. If set, must match the network_name of NetworkAttachmentDefinition 2.


```json
{
  "ipam": {
    "type": "whereabouts",
    "range": "192.0.2.192/24",
    "network_name": "example_net_common", 1
  }
}
```


Optional. If set, must match the network_name of NetworkAttachmentDefinition 1.

## Creating a whereabouts-reconciler daemon set

The Whereabouts reconciler is responsible for managing dynamic IP address assignments for the pods within a cluster by using the Whereabouts IP Address Management (IPAM) solution. It ensures that each pod gets a unique IP address from the specified IP address range. It also handles IP address releases when pods are deleted or scaled down.


[NOTE]
----
You can also use a NetworkAttachmentDefinition custom resource definition (CRD) for dynamic IP address assignment.
----

The whereabouts-reconciler daemon set is automatically created when you configure a secondary network through the Cluster Network Operator. It is not automatically created when you configure a secondary network from a YAML manifest.

To trigger the deployment of the whereabouts-reconciler daemon set, you must manually create a whereabouts-shim network attachment by editing the Cluster Network Operator custom resource (CR) file.

Use the following procedure to deploy the whereabouts-reconciler daemon set.

1. Edit the Network.operator.openshift.io custom resource (CR) by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc edit network.operator.openshift.io cluster
```

2. Include the additionalNetworks section shown in this example YAML extract within the spec definition of the custom resource (CR):

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
# ...
spec:
  additionalNetworks:
  - name: whereabouts-shim
    namespace: default
    rawCNIConfig: |-
      {
       "name": "whereabouts-shim",
       "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
       "type": "bridge",
       "ipam": {
         "type": "whereabouts"
       }
      }
    type: Raw
# ...
```

3. Save the file and exit the text editor.
4. Verify that the whereabouts-reconciler daemon set deployed successfully by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get all -n openshift-multus | grep whereabouts-reconciler
```

Example output

```terminal
pod/whereabouts-reconciler-jnp6g 1/1 Running 0 6s
pod/whereabouts-reconciler-k76gg 1/1 Running 0 6s
pod/whereabouts-reconciler-k86t9 1/1 Running 0 6s
pod/whereabouts-reconciler-p4sxw 1/1 Running 0 6s
pod/whereabouts-reconciler-rvfdv 1/1 Running 0 6s
pod/whereabouts-reconciler-svzw9 1/1 Running 0 6s
daemonset.apps/whereabouts-reconciler 6 6 6 6 6 kubernetes.io/os=linux 6s
```


## Configuring the Whereabouts IP reconciler schedule

The Whereabouts IPAM CNI plugin runs the IP reconciler daily. This process cleans up any stranded IP allocations that might result in exhausting IPs and therefore prevent new pods from getting an IP allocated to them.

Use this procedure to change the frequency at which the IP reconciler runs.

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You have deployed the whereabouts-reconciler daemon set, and the whereabouts-reconciler pods are up and running.

1. Run the following command to create a ConfigMap object named whereabouts-config in the openshift-multus namespace with a specific cron expression for the IP reconciler:

```terminal
$ oc create configmap whereabouts-config -n openshift-multus --from-literal=reconciler_cron_expression="*/15 * * * *"
```


This cron expression indicates the IP reconciler runs every 15 minutes. Adjust the expression based on your specific requirements.

[NOTE]
----
The whereabouts-reconciler daemon set can only consume a cron expression pattern that includes five asterisks. The sixth, which is used to denote seconds, is currently not supported.
----
2. Retrieve information about resources related to the whereabouts-reconciler daemon set and pods within the openshift-multus namespace by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get all -n openshift-multus | grep whereabouts-reconciler
```

Example output

```terminal
pod/whereabouts-reconciler-2p7hw                   1/1     Running   0             4m14s
pod/whereabouts-reconciler-76jk7                   1/1     Running   0             4m14s
pod/whereabouts-reconciler-94zw6                   1/1     Running   0             4m14s
pod/whereabouts-reconciler-mfh68                   1/1     Running   0             4m14s
pod/whereabouts-reconciler-pgshz                   1/1     Running   0             4m14s
pod/whereabouts-reconciler-xn5xz                   1/1     Running   0             4m14s
daemonset.apps/whereabouts-reconciler          6         6         6       6            6           kubernetes.io/os=linux   4m16s
```

3. Run the following command to verify that the whereabouts-reconciler pod runs the IP reconciler with the configured interval:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-multus logs whereabouts-reconciler-2p7hw
```

Example output

```terminal
2024-02-02T16:33:54Z [debug] event not relevant: "/cron-schedule/..2024_02_02_16_33_54.1375928161": CREATE

## Fast IPAM configuration for the Whereabouts IPAM CNI plugin

Wherabouts is an IP Address Management (IPAM) Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin that assigns IP addresses at a cluster-wide level. Whereabouts does not require a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server.

A typical Wherabouts workflow is described as follows:

1. Whereabouts takes an address range in classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) notation, such as 192.168.2.0/24, and assigns IP addresses within that range, such as 192.168.2.1 to 192.168.2.254.
2. Whereabouts assigns an IP address, the lowest value address in a CIDR range, to a pod and tracks the IP address in a data store for the lifetime of that pod.
3. When the pod is removed, Whereabouts frees the address from the pod so that the address is available for assignment.

To improve the performance of Whereabouts, especially if nodes in your cluster run a high amount of pods, you can enable the Fast IPAM feature.


[IMPORTANT]
----
{FeatureName} is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
----

The Fast IPAM feature uses nodeslicepools, which are managed by the Whereabouts Controller, to optimize IP allocation for nodes.

* You added the whereabouts-shim configuration to the Network.operator.openshift.io custom resource (CR), so that the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) can deploy the Whereabouts Controller. See "Creating a Whereabouts reconciler daemon set".
* For the Fast IPAM feature to work, ensure that the NetworkAttachmentDefinition (NAD) and the pod exist in the same openshift-multus namesapace.

1. Confirm that the Whereabouts Controller is running by entering the following command.

```terminal
$ oc get pods -n openshift-multus | grep controller
```

Example output

```terminal
multus-admission-controller-d89bc96f-gbf7s   2/2     Running   0              6h3m
...
```


[IMPORTANT]
----
If the Whereabouts Controller is not running, the Fast IPAM does not work.
----
2. Create a NAD file for your cluster and add the Fast IPAM details to the file:
Example NAD file with a Fast IPAM configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: "k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1"
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: wb-ipam
  namespace: openshift-multus 1
spec:
  config: {
	"cniVersion": "0.3.0",
	"name": "wb-ipam-cni-name", 2
	"type": "bridge",
	"bridge": "cni0",
	"ipam": {
  	"type": "whereabouts", 3
  	"range": "10.5.0.0/20", 4
  	"node_slice_size": "/24" 5
    }
  }
# ...
```

The namespace where CNO deploys the NAD.
The name of the Whereabouts IPAM CNI plugin.
The type of IPAM CNI plugin: whereabouts.
The IP address range for the IP pool that the Whereabouts IPAM CNI plugin uses for allocating IP addresses to pods.
Sets the slice size of IP addresses available to each node.
3. Add the Whereabouts IPAM CNI plugin annotation details to the YAML file for the pod:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: <pod_name> 1
  annotations:
  k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: openshift-multus/wb-ipam 2
spec:
  containers:
  - name: samplepod 3
  command: ["/bin/ash", "-c", "trap : TERM INT; sleep infinity & wait"] 4
  image: alpine
# ...
```

The name of the pod.
The annotation details that references the Whereabouts IPAM CNI plugin name that exists in the openshift-multus namespace.
The name of the container for the pod.
Defines the entry point for the container and controls the behavior of the container in the Whereabouts IPAM CNI plugin.
4. Apply the NAD file configuration to pods that exist on nodes that run in your cluster:

```terminal
$ oc create -f <NAD_file_name>.yaml
```


1. Show the IP address details of the pod by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc describe pod <pod_name>
```

Example output

```terminal
...
IP:     192.168.2.0
IPs:
  IP:   192.168.2.0
Containers:
  samplepod:
    Container ID:   docker://<image_name>
    Image:          <app_name>:v1
    Image ID:
...
```

2. Access the pod and confirm its interfaces by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc exec <pod_name> -- ip a
```

Example output

```terminal
...
3: net1@if23: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP,M-DOWN> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue
    link/ether 82:01:98:e5:0c:b7 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.2.0/24 brd 10.10.0.255 scope global net1 1
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::8001:98ff:fee5:cb7/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
...
```

Pod is attached to the 192.168.2.1 IP address on the net1 interface as expected.
3. Check that the node selector pool exists in the openshift-multus namespace by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get nodeslicepool -n openshift-multus
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME            AGE
nodeslicepool   32m
```


## Creating a configuration for assignment of dual-stack IP addresses dynamically

Dual-stack IP address assignment can be configured with the ipRanges parameter for:

* IPv4 addresses
* IPv6 addresses
* multiple IP address assignment

1. Set type to whereabouts.
2. Use ipRanges to allocate IP addresses as shown in the following example:

```yaml
cniVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
=metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  additionalNetworks:
  - name: whereabouts-shim
    namespace: default
    type: Raw
    rawCNIConfig: |-
      {
       "name": "whereabouts-dual-stack",
       "cniVersion": "0.3.1,
       "type": "bridge",
       "ipam": {
         "type": "whereabouts",
         "ipRanges": [
                  {"range": "192.168.10.0/24"},
                  {"range": "2001:db8::/64"}
              ]
       }
      }
```

3. Attach network to a pod. For more information, see "Adding a pod to a secondary network".
4. Verify that all IP addresses are assigned.
5. Run the following command to ensure the IP addresses are assigned as metadata.

```yaml
$ oc exec -it mypod -- ip a
```
