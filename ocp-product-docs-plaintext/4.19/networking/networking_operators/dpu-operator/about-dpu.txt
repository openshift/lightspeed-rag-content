# About DPU and the DPU Operator


As a cluster administrator, you can add the DPU Operator to your cluster to manage DPU devices and network attachments.

[IMPORTANT]
----
The DPU Operator is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

# Orchestrating DPUs with the DPU Operator

A DPU (Data Processing Unit) is a type of programmable processor that is considered one of the three fundamental pillars of computing, alongside CPUs and GPUs. While CPUs handle general computing tasks and GPUs accelerate specific workloads, the primary role of the DPU is to offload and accelerate data-centric workloads, such as networking, storage, and security functions.

DPUs are typically used in data centers and cloud environments to improve performance, reduce latency, and enhance security by offloading these tasks from the CPU. DPUs can also be used to create a more efficient and flexible infrastructure by enabling the deployment of specialized workloads closer to the data source.

The DPU Operator is responsible for managing the DPU devices and network attachments. The DPU Operator deploys the DPU daemon onto Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform compute nodes that interface through an API controlling the DPU daemon running on the DPU. The DPU Operator is responsible for the life-cycle management of the ovn-kube components and the necessary host network initialization on the DPU.
