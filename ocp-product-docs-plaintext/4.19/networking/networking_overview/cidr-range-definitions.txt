# CIDR range definitions


If your cluster uses OVN-Kubernetes, you must specify non-overlapping ranges for Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) subnet ranges.

[IMPORTANT]
----
For Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.17 and later versions, clusters use 169.254.0.0/17 for IPv4 and fd69::/112 for IPv6 as the default masquerade subnet. These ranges should also be avoided by users. For upgraded clusters, there is no change to the default masquerade subnet.
----
The following subnet types and are mandatory for a cluster that uses OVN-Kubernetes:
* Join: Uses a join switch to connect gateway routers to distributed routers. A join switch reduces the number of IP addresses for a distributed router. For a cluster that uses the OVN-Kubernetes plugin, an IP address from a dedicated subnet is assigned to any logical port that attaches to the join switch.
* Masquerade: Prevents collisions for identical source and destination IP addresses that are sent from a node as hairpin traffic to the same node after a load balancer makes a routing decision.
* Transit: A transit switch is a type of distributed switch that spans across all nodes in the cluster. A transit switch routes traffic between different zones. For a cluster that uses the OVN-Kubernetes plugin, an IP address from a dedicated subnet is assigned to any logical port that attaches to the transit switch.

[NOTE]
----
You can change the join, masquerade, and transit CIDR ranges for your cluster as a post-installation task.
----
OVN-Kubernetes, the default network provider in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14 and later versions, internally uses the following IP address subnet ranges:
* V4JoinSubnet: 100.64.0.0/16
* V6JoinSubnet: fd98::/64
* V4TransitSwitchSubnet: 100.88.0.0/16
* V6TransitSwitchSubnet: fd97::/64
* defaultV4MasqueradeSubnet: 169.254.0.0/17
* defaultV6MasqueradeSubnet: fd69::/112

[IMPORTANT]
----
The previous list includes join, transit, and masquerade IPv4 and IPv6 address subnets. If your cluster uses OVN-Kubernetes, do not include any of these IP address subnet ranges in any other CIDR definitions in your cluster or infrastructure.
----
* For more information about configuring join subnets or transit subnets, see Configuring OVN-Kubernetes internal IP address subnets.

# Machine CIDR

In the Machine classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) field, you must specify the IP address range for machines or cluster nodes.


[NOTE]
----
Machine CIDR ranges cannot be changed after creating your cluster.
----

The default is 10.0.0.0/16. This range must not conflict with any connected networks.

* Cluster Network Operator configuration

# Service CIDR

In the Service CIDR field, you must specify the IP address range for services.
The range must be large enough to accommodate your workload. The address block must not overlap with any external service accessed from within the cluster. The default is 172.30.0.0/16.

# Pod CIDR

In the pod CIDR field, you must specify the IP address range for pods.

The range must be large enough to accommodate your workload. The address block must not overlap with any external service accessed from within the cluster. The default is 10.128.0.0/14.

# Host Prefix

In the Host Prefix field, you must specify the subnet prefix length assigned to pods scheduled to individual machines. The host prefix determines the pod IP address pool for each machine.

# CIDR ranges for hosted control planes

For deploying hosted control planes on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, use the following required Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) subnet ranges:

* v4InternalSubnet: 100.65.0.0/16 (OVN-Kubernetes)
* clusterNetwork: 10.132.0.0/14 (pod network)
* serviceNetwork: 172.31.0.0/16
