# Installing the CLI Manager Operator



[NOTE]
----
Krew always works with OpenShift CLI (`oc`) without the CLI Manager Operator installed. You can use the same commands outlined in this documentation to use Krew with oc. For more information, see Krew documentation.
----
You can run the CLI Manager Operator in both connected and disconnected environments. In particular, it eases the installation and management of CLI plugins in disconnected environments. The CLI Manager Operator makes Krew compatible with the oc CLI. Cluster administrators can use the CLI Manager Operator to add CLI plugin custom resources that can then be accessed in both connected and disconnected environments. Cluster administrators install and configure the CLI Manager Operator, and users then add the custom index to Krew and add CLI plugins to the CLI Manager Operator.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Using the CLI Manager Operator to install and manage plugins for the OpenShift CLI is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.

# Adding the CLI Manager Operator custom index to Krew

You can use the terminal to add the CLI manager custom index to Krew. This procedure is required for the CLI Manager Operator to function correctly and needs to be done only once.

The custom index connects Krew to the CLI Manager Operator binaries and enables the CLI Manager Operator to work in disconnected environments.

----
If you use self-signed certificates, mark the certificate as trusted on your local operating system to use Krew.

# Adding a plugin to the CLI Manager Operator

You can add a CLI plugin to the CLI Manager Operator by using the YAML View.

* You are logged in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* The CLI Manager Operator is installed.

1. Log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.
2. Navigate to Operators -> Installed Operators.
3. From the list, select CLI Manager Operator.
4. Select the CLI Plugin tab.
5. Click Create Plugin.
6. In the text box, enter the information for the plugin you are installing. See the following example YAML file.
Example YAML file to add a plugin

```yaml
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: Plugin
metadata:
  name: <plugin_name> 1
spec:
  description: <description_of_plugin>
  homepage: <plugin_homepage>
  platforms:
  - bin: 2
    files:
    - from: <plugin_file_path>
      to: .
    image: <plugin_image>
    imagePullSecret: 3
    platform: <platform> 4
  shortDescription: <short_description_of_plugin>
  version: <version> 5
```

The name of the plugin you plan to use in commands.
Bin specifies the path to the plugin executable.
Optional: If the registry is not public, add a pull secret to access your plugin image.
Add the architecture for your system; for example, linux/amd64, darwin/arm64, windows/amd64, or another architecture.
Version must be in v0.0.0 format.
7. Click Save.

* Enter the following command to see if the plugin is listed and has been added successfully:


```terminal
$ oc get plugin/<plugin_name> -o yaml
```



```terminal
<plugin_name> ready to be served.
```
