# Configuring the OpenShift CLI



# Enabling tab completion

You can enable tab completion for the Bash or Zsh shells.

## Enabling tab completion for Bash

After you install the OpenShift CLI (oc), you can enable tab completion to automatically complete oc commands or suggest options when you press Tab. The following procedure enables tab completion for the Bash shell.

* You must have the OpenShift CLI (oc) installed.
* You must have the package bash-completion installed.

1. Save the Bash completion code to a file:

```terminal
$ oc completion bash > oc_bash_completion
```

2. Copy the file to /etc/bash_completion.d/:

```terminal
$ sudo cp oc_bash_completion /etc/bash_completion.d/
```


You can also save the file to a local directory and source it from your .bashrc file instead. Tab completion is enabled when you open a new terminal.

## Enabling tab completion for Zsh

After you install the OpenShift CLI (oc), you can enable tab completion to automatically complete oc commands or suggest options when you press Tab. The following procedure enables tab completion for the Zsh shell.

* You must have the OpenShift CLI (oc) installed.

* To add tab completion for oc to your .zshrc file, run the following command:

```terminal
$ cat >>~/.zshrc<<EOF
autoload -Uz compinit
compinit
if [ $commands[oc] ]; then
  source <(oc completion zsh)
  compdef _oc oc
fi
EOF
```


Tab completion is enabled when you open a new terminal.
