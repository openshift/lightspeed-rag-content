# Backing up applications on ROSA clusters using OADP


You can use OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) with Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) clusters to back up and restore application data.
ROSA is a fully-managed, turnkey application platform that allows you to deliver value to your customers by building and deploying applications.
ROSA provides seamless integration with a wide range of Amazon Web Services (AWS) compute, database, analytics, machine learning, networking, mobile, and other services to speed up the building and delivery of differentiating experiences to your customers.
You can subscribe to the service directly from your AWS account.
After you create your clusters, you can operate your clusters with the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console or through Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager. You can also use ROSA with OpenShift APIs and command-line interface (CLI) tools.
For additional information about ROSA installation, see Installing Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) interactive walkthrough.
Before installing OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP), you must set up role and policy credentials for OADP so that it can use the Amazon Web Services API.
This process is performed in the following two stages:
1. Prepare AWS credentials
2. Install the OADP Operator and give it an IAM role

# Preparing AWS credentials for OADP

An Amazon Web Services account must be prepared and configured to accept an OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) installation.

1. Create the following environment variables by running the following commands:

[IMPORTANT]
----
Change the cluster name to match your ROSA cluster, and ensure you are logged into the cluster as an administrator. Ensure that all fields are outputted correctly before continuing.
----

```terminal
$ export CLUSTER_NAME=my-cluster 1
  export ROSA_CLUSTER_ID=$(rosa describe cluster -c ${CLUSTER_NAME} --output json | jq -r .id)
  export REGION=$(rosa describe cluster -c ${CLUSTER_NAME} --output json | jq -r .region.id)
  export OIDC_ENDPOINT=$(oc get authentication.config.openshift.io cluster -o jsonpath='{.spec.serviceAccountIssuer}' | sed 's|^https://||')
  export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)
  export CLUSTER_VERSION=$(rosa describe cluster -c ${CLUSTER_NAME} -o json | jq -r .version.raw_id | cut -f -2 -d '.')
  export ROLE_NAME="${CLUSTER_NAME}-openshift-oadp-aws-cloud-credentials"
  export SCRATCH="/tmp/${CLUSTER_NAME}/oadp"
  mkdir -p ${SCRATCH}
  echo "Cluster ID: ${ROSA_CLUSTER_ID}, Region: ${REGION}, OIDC Endpoint:
  ${OIDC_ENDPOINT}, AWS Account ID: ${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}"
```

Replace my-cluster with your ROSA cluster name.
2. On the AWS account, create an IAM policy to allow access to AWS S3:
1. Check to see if the policy exists by running the following command:

```terminal
$ POLICY_ARN=$(aws iam list-policies --query "Policies[?PolicyName=='RosaOadpVer1'].{ARN:Arn}" --output text) 1
```

Replace RosaOadp with your policy name.
2. Enter the following command to create the policy JSON file and then create the policy in ROSA:

[NOTE]
----
If the policy ARN is not found, the command creates the policy. If the policy ARN already exists, the if statement intentionally skips the policy creation.
----

```terminal
$ if [[ -z "${POLICY_ARN}" ]]; then
  cat << EOF > ${SCRATCH}/policy.json 1
  {
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:CreateBucket",
        "s3:DeleteBucket",
        "s3:PutBucketTagging",
        "s3:GetBucketTagging",
        "s3:PutEncryptionConfiguration",
        "s3:GetEncryptionConfiguration",
        "s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration",
        "s3:GetLifecycleConfiguration",
        "s3:GetBucketLocation",
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject",
        "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads",
        "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
        "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts",
        "ec2:DescribeSnapshots",
        "ec2:DescribeVolumes",
        "ec2:DescribeVolumeAttribute",
        "ec2:DescribeVolumesModifications",
        "ec2:DescribeVolumeStatus",
        "ec2:CreateTags",
        "ec2:CreateVolume",
        "ec2:CreateSnapshot",
        "ec2:DeleteSnapshot"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]}
EOF

  POLICY_ARN=$(aws iam create-policy --policy-name "RosaOadpVer1" \
  --policy-document file:///${SCRATCH}/policy.json --query Policy.Arn \
  --tags Key=rosa_openshift_version,Value=${CLUSTER_VERSION} Key=rosa_role_prefix,Value=ManagedOpenShift Key=operator_namespace,Value=openshift-oadp Key=operator_name,Value=openshift-oadp \
  --output text)
  fi
```

SCRATCH is a name for a temporary directory created for the environment variables.
3. View the policy ARN by running the following command:

```terminal
$ echo ${POLICY_ARN}
```

3. Create an IAM role trust policy for the cluster:
1. Create the trust policy file by running the following command:

```terminal
$ cat <<EOF > ${SCRATCH}/trust-policy.json
  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [{
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
          "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}:oidc-provider/${OIDC_ENDPOINT}"
        },
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
        "Condition": {
          "StringEquals": {
            "${OIDC_ENDPOINT}:sub": [
              "system:serviceaccount:openshift-adp:openshift-adp-controller-manager",
              "system:serviceaccount:openshift-adp:velero"]
          }
        }
      }]
  }
EOF
```

2. Create the role by running the following command:

```terminal
$ ROLE_ARN=$(aws iam create-role --role-name \
  "${ROLE_NAME}" \
  --assume-role-policy-document file://${SCRATCH}/trust-policy.json \
  --tags Key=rosa_cluster_id,Value=${ROSA_CLUSTER_ID} \
         Key=rosa_openshift_version,Value=${CLUSTER_VERSION} \
         Key=rosa_role_prefix,Value=ManagedOpenShift \
         Key=operator_namespace,Value=openshift-adp \
         Key=operator_name,Value=openshift-oadp \
  --query Role.Arn --output text)
```

3. View the role ARN by running the following command:

```terminal
$ echo ${ROLE_ARN}
```

4. Attach the IAM policy to the IAM role by running the following command:

```terminal
$ aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name "${ROLE_NAME}" \
  --policy-arn ${POLICY_ARN}
```


# Installing the OADP Operator and providing the IAM role

AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) is a global web service that provides short-term credentials for IAM or federated users. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (ROSA) with STS is the recommended credential mode for ROSA clusters. This document describes how to install OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) on ROSA with AWS STS.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Restic is unsupported.
Kopia file system backup (FSB) is supported when backing up file systems that do not have Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshotting support.
Example file systems include the following:
* Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)
* Network File System (NFS)
* emptyDir volumes
* Local volumes
For backing up volumes, OADP on ROSA with AWS STS supports only native snapshots and Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots.
In an Amazon ROSA cluster that uses STS authentication, restoring backed-up data in a different AWS region is not supported.
The Data Mover feature is not currently supported in ROSA clusters. You can use native AWS S3 tools for moving data.
----

* An Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform ROSA cluster with the required access and tokens. For instructions, see the previous procedure Preparing AWS credentials for OADP. If you plan to use two different clusters for backing up and restoring, you must prepare AWS credentials, including ROLE_ARN, for each cluster.

1. Create an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform secret from your AWS token file by entering the following commands:
1. Create the credentials file:

```terminal
$ cat <<EOF > ${SCRATCH}/credentials
  [default]
  role_arn = ${ROLE_ARN}
  web_identity_token_file = /var/run/secrets/openshift/serviceaccount/token
  region = <aws_region> 1
EOF
```

Replace <aws_region> with the AWS region to use for the STS endpoint.
2. Create a namespace for OADP:

```terminal
$ oc create namespace openshift-adp
```

3. Create the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform secret:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-adp create secret generic cloud-credentials \
  --from-file=${SCRATCH}/credentials
```


[NOTE]
----
In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform versions 4.15 and later, the OADP Operator supports a new standardized STS workflow through the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)
and Cloud Credentials Operator (CCO). In this workflow, you do not need to create the above
secret, you only need to supply the role ARN during the installation of OLM-managed operators using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, for more information see Installing from OperatorHub using the web console.
The preceding secret is created automatically by CCO.
----
2. Install the OADP Operator:
1. In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, browse to Operators -> OperatorHub.
2. Search for the OADP Operator.
3. In the role_ARN field, paste the role_arn that you created previously and click Install.
3. Create AWS cloud storage using your AWS credentials by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ cat << EOF | oc create -f -
  apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
  kind: CloudStorage
  metadata:
    name: ${CLUSTER_NAME}-oadp
    namespace: openshift-adp
  spec:
    creationSecret:
      key: credentials
      name: cloud-credentials
    enableSharedConfig: true
    name: ${CLUSTER_NAME}-oadp
    provider: aws
    region: $REGION
EOF
```

4. Check your application's storage default storage class by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get pvc -n <namespace>
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME     STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
applog   Bound    pvc-351791ae-b6ab-4e8b-88a4-30f73caf5ef8   1Gi        RWO            gp3-csi        4d19h
mysql    Bound    pvc-16b8e009-a20a-4379-accc-bc81fedd0621   1Gi        RWO            gp3-csi        4d19h
```

5. Get the storage class by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get storageclass
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                PROVISIONER             RECLAIMPOLICY   VOLUMEBINDINGMODE      ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION   AGE
gp2                 kubernetes.io/aws-ebs   Delete          WaitForFirstConsumer   true                   4d21h
gp2-csi             ebs.csi.aws.com         Delete          WaitForFirstConsumer   true                   4d21h
gp3                 ebs.csi.aws.com         Delete          WaitForFirstConsumer   true                   4d21h
gp3-csi (default)   ebs.csi.aws.com         Delete          WaitForFirstConsumer   true                   4d21h
```


[NOTE]
----
The following storage classes will work:
* gp3-csi
* gp2-csi
* gp3
* gp2
----

If the application or applications that are being backed up are all using persistent volumes (PVs) with Container Storage Interface (CSI), it is advisable to include the CSI plugin in the OADP DPA configuration.
6. Create the DataProtectionApplication resource to configure the connection to the storage where the backups and volume snapshots are stored:
1. If you are using only CSI volumes, deploy a Data Protection Application by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ cat << EOF | oc create -f -
  apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
  kind: DataProtectionApplication
  metadata:
    name: ${CLUSTER_NAME}-dpa
    namespace: openshift-adp
  spec:
    backupImages: true 1
    features:
      dataMover:
        enable: false
    backupLocations:
    - bucket:
        cloudStorageRef:
          name: ${CLUSTER_NAME}-oadp
        credential:
          key: credentials
          name: cloud-credentials
        prefix: velero
        default: true
        config:
          region: ${REGION}
    configuration:
      velero:
        defaultPlugins:
        - openshift
        - aws
        - csi
      nodeAgent:  2
        enable: false
        uploaderType: kopia 3
EOF
```

ROSA supports internal image backup. Set this field to false if you do not want to use image backup.
See the important note regarding the nodeAgent attribute.
The type of uploader. The possible values are restic or kopia. The built-in Data Mover uses Kopia as the default uploader mechanism regardless of the value of the uploaderType field.

1. If you are using CSI or non-CSI volumes, deploy a Data Protection Application by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ cat << EOF | oc create -f -
  apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
  kind: DataProtectionApplication
  metadata:
    name: ${CLUSTER_NAME}-dpa
    namespace: openshift-adp
  spec:
    backupImages: true 1
    backupLocations:
    - bucket:
        cloudStorageRef:
          name: ${CLUSTER_NAME}-oadp
        credential:
          key: credentials
          name: cloud-credentials
        prefix: velero
        default: true
        config:
          region: ${REGION}
    configuration:
      velero:
        defaultPlugins:
        - openshift
        - aws
      nodeAgent: 2
        enable: false
        uploaderType: restic
    snapshotLocations:
      - velero:
          config:
            credentialsFile: /tmp/credentials/openshift-adp/cloud-credentials-credentials 3
            enableSharedConfig: "true" 4
            profile: default 5
            region: ${REGION} 6
          provider: aws
EOF
```

ROSA supports internal image backup. Set this field to false if you do not want to use image backup.
See the important note regarding the nodeAgent attribute.
The credentialsFile field is the mounted location of the bucket credential on the pod.
The enableSharedConfig field allows the snapshotLocations to share or reuse the credential defined for the bucket.
Use the profile name set in the AWS credentials file.
Specify region as your AWS region. This must be the same as the cluster region.

You are now ready to back up and restore Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform applications, as described in Backing up applications.


[IMPORTANT]
----
The enable parameter of restic is set to false in this configuration, because OADP does not support Restic in ROSA environments.
If you use OADP 1.2, replace this configuration:

```terminal
nodeAgent:
  enable: false
  uploaderType: restic
```

with the following configuration:

```terminal
restic:
  enable: false
```

----

If you want to use two different clusters for backing up and restoring, the two clusters must have the same AWS S3 storage names in both the cloud storage CR and the OADP DataProtectionApplication configuration.

# Updating the IAM role ARN in the OADP Operator subscription

While installing the OADP Operator on a ROSA Security Token Service (STS) cluster, if you provide an incorrect IAM role Amazon Resource Name (ARN), the openshift-adp-controller pod gives an error. The credential requests that are generated contain the wrong IAM role ARN. To update the credential requests object with the correct IAM role ARN, you can edit the OADP Operator subscription and patch the IAM role ARN with the correct value. By editing the OADP Operator subscription, you do not have to uninstall and reinstall OADP to update the IAM role ARN.

* You have installed OADP on the ROSA STS cluster.

1. To verify that the OADP subscription has the wrong IAM role ARN environment variable set, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get sub -o yaml redhat-oadp-operator
```

Example subscription

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  annotations:
  creationTimestamp: "2025-01-15T07:18:31Z"
  generation: 1
  labels:
    operators.coreos.com/redhat-oadp-operator.openshift-adp: ""
  name: redhat-oadp-operator
  namespace: openshift-adp
  resourceVersion: "77363"
  uid: 5ba00906-5ad2-4476-ae7b-ffa90986283d
spec:
  channel: stable-1.4
  config:
    env:
    - name: ROLEARN
      value: arn:aws:iam::11111111:role/wrong-role-arn 1
  installPlanApproval: Manual
  name: redhat-oadp-operator
  source: prestage-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
  startingCSV: oadp-operator.v1.4.2
```

Verify the value of ROLEARN you want to update.
2. Update the ROLEARN field of the subscription with the correct role ARN by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc patch subscription redhat-oadp-operator -p '{"spec": {"config": {"env": [{"name": "ROLEARN", "value": "<role_arn>"}]}}}' --type='merge'
```


where:
<role_arn>:: Specifies the IAM role ARN to be updated. For example, arn:aws:iam::160&#8230;&#8203;..6956:role/oadprosa&#8230;&#8203;..8wlf.
3. Verify that the secret object is updated with correct role ARN value by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get secret cloud-credentials -o jsonpath='{.data.credentials}' | base64 -d
```

Example output

```terminal
[default]
sts_regional_endpoints = regional
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::160.....6956:role/oadprosa.....8wlf
web_identity_token_file = /var/run/secrets/openshift/serviceaccount/token
```

4. Configure the DataProtectionApplication custom resource (CR) manifest file as shown in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
metadata:
  name: test-rosa-dpa
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  backupLocations:
  - bucket:
      config:
        region: us-east-1
      cloudStorageRef:
        name: <cloud_storage> 1
      credential:
        name: cloud-credentials
        key: credentials
      prefix: velero
      default: true
  configuration:
    velero:
      defaultPlugins:
      - aws
      - openshift
```

Specify the CloudStorage CR.
5. Create the DataProtectionApplication CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f <dpa_manifest_file>
```

6. Verify that the DataProtectionApplication CR is reconciled and the status is set to "True" by running the following command:

```terminal
$  oc get dpa -n openshift-adp -o yaml
```

Example DataProtectionApplication

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
...
status:
    conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: "2023-07-31T04:48:12Z"
      message: Reconcile complete
      reason: Complete
      status: "True"
      type: Reconciled
```

7. Verify that the BackupStorageLocation CR is in an available state by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get backupstoragelocations.velero.io -n openshift-adp
```

Example BackupStorageLocation

```terminal
NAME       PHASE       LAST VALIDATED   AGE   DEFAULT
ts-dpa-1   Available   3s               6s    true
```


* Installing from OperatorHub using the web console.
* Backing up applications

# Example: Backing up workload on OADP ROSA STS, with an optional cleanup

## Performing a backup with OADP and ROSA STS

The following example hello-world application has no persistent volumes (PVs) attached. Perform a backup with OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) with Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) STS.

Either Data Protection Application (DPA) configuration will work.

1. Create a workload to back up by running the following commands:

```terminal
$ oc create namespace hello-world
```


```terminal
$ oc new-app -n hello-world --image=docker.io/openshift/hello-openshift
```

2. Expose the route by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc expose service/hello-openshift -n hello-world
```

3. Check that the application is working by running the following command:

```terminal
$ curl `oc get route/hello-openshift -n hello-world -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}'`
```

Example output

```terminal
Hello OpenShift!
```

4. Back up the workload by running the following command:

```terminal
$ cat << EOF | oc create -f -
  apiVersion: velero.io/v1
  kind: Backup
  metadata:
    name: hello-world
    namespace: openshift-adp
  spec:
    includedNamespaces:
    - hello-world
    storageLocation: ${CLUSTER_NAME}-dpa-1
    ttl: 720h0m0s
EOF
```

5. Wait until the backup is completed and then run the following command:

```terminal
$ watch "oc -n openshift-adp get backup hello-world -o json | jq .status"
```

Example output

```json
{
  "completionTimestamp": "2022-09-07T22:20:44Z",
  "expiration": "2022-10-07T22:20:22Z",
  "formatVersion": "1.1.0",
  "phase": "Completed",
  "progress": {
    "itemsBackedUp": 58,
    "totalItems": 58
  },
  "startTimestamp": "2022-09-07T22:20:22Z",
  "version": 1
}
```

6. Delete the demo workload by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete ns hello-world
```

7. Restore the workload from the backup by running the following command:

```terminal
$ cat << EOF | oc create -f -
  apiVersion: velero.io/v1
  kind: Restore
  metadata:
    name: hello-world
    namespace: openshift-adp
  spec:
    backupName: hello-world
EOF
```

8. Wait for the Restore to finish by running the following command:

```terminal
$ watch "oc -n openshift-adp get restore hello-world -o json | jq .status"
```

Example output

```json
{
  "completionTimestamp": "2022-09-07T22:25:47Z",
  "phase": "Completed",
  "progress": {
    "itemsRestored": 38,
    "totalItems": 38
  },
  "startTimestamp": "2022-09-07T22:25:28Z",
  "warnings": 9
}
```

9. Check that the workload is restored by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n hello-world get pods
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hello-openshift-9f885f7c6-kdjpj   1/1     Running   0          90s
```

10. Check the JSONPath by running the following command:

```terminal
$ curl `oc get route/hello-openshift -n hello-world -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}'`
```

Example output

```terminal
Hello OpenShift!
```



[NOTE]

## Cleaning up a cluster after a backup with OADP and ROSA STS

If you need to uninstall the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Operator together with the backups and the S3 bucket from this example, follow these instructions.

1. Delete the workload by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete ns hello-world
```

2. Delete the Data Protection Application (DPA) by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-adp delete dpa ${CLUSTER_NAME}-dpa
```

3. Delete the cloud storage by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-adp delete cloudstorage ${CLUSTER_NAME}-oadp
```


[WARNING]
----
If this command hangs, you might need to delete the finalizer by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-adp patch cloudstorage ${CLUSTER_NAME}-oadp -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":null}}' --type=merge
```

----
4. If the Operator is no longer required, remove it by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-adp delete subscription oadp-operator
```

5. Remove the namespace from the Operator:

```terminal
$ oc delete ns openshift-adp
```

6. If the backup and restore resources are no longer required, remove them from the cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete backups.velero.io hello-world
```

7. To delete backup, restore and remote objects in AWS S3 run the following command:

```terminal
$ velero backup delete hello-world
```

8. If you no longer need the Custom Resource Definitions (CRD), remove them from the cluster by running the following command:
