# Including a self-signed CA certificate during backup


You can include a self-signed Certificate Authority (CA) certificate in the Data Protection Application (DPA) and then back up an application. You store the backup in a NooBaa bucket provided by Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF).

# Backing up an application and its self-signed CA certificate

The s3.openshift-storage.svc service, provided by ODF, uses a Transport Layer Security protocol (TLS) certificate that is signed with the self-signed service CA.

To prevent a certificate signed by unknown authority error, you must include a self-signed CA certificate in the backup storage location (BSL) section of DataProtectionApplication custom resource (CR). For this situation, you must complete the following tasks:

* Request a NooBaa bucket by creating an object bucket claim (OBC).
* Extract the bucket details.
* Include a self-signed CA certificate in the DataProtectionApplication CR.
* Back up an application.

* You installed the OADP Operator.
* You installed the ODF Operator.
* You have an application with a database running in a separate namespace.

1. Create an OBC manifest to request a NooBaa bucket as shown in the following example:
Example ObjectBucketClaim CR

```yaml
apiVersion: objectbucket.io/v1alpha1
kind: ObjectBucketClaim
metadata:
  name: test-obc 1
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  storageClassName: openshift-storage.noobaa.io
  generateBucketName: test-backup-bucket 2
```

Specifies the name of the object bucket claim.
Specifies the name of the bucket.
2. Create the OBC by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f <obc_file_name>
```

3. When you create an OBC, ODF creates a secret and a ConfigMap with the same name as the object bucket claim. The secret object contains the bucket credentials, and the ConfigMap object contains information to access the bucket. To get the bucket name and bucket host from the generated config map, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc extract --to=- cm/test-obc 1
```

The name of the OBC is test-obc.
Example output

```terminal
# BUCKET_NAME
backup-c20...41fd
# BUCKET_PORT
443
# BUCKET_REGION

# BUCKET_SUBREGION

# BUCKET_HOST
s3.openshift-storage.svc
```

4. To get the bucket credentials from the secret object , run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc extract --to=- secret/test-obc
```

Example output

```terminal
# AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
ebYR....xLNMc
# AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
YXf...+NaCkdyC3QPym
```

5. Create a cloud-credentials file with the object bucket credentials by using the following example configuration:

```terminal
[default]
aws_access_key_id=<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
aws_secret_access_key=<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
```

6. Create the cloud-credentials secret with the cloud-credentials file content by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create secret generic \
  cloud-credentials \
  -n openshift-adp \
  --from-file cloud=cloud-credentials
```

7. Extract the service CA certificate from the openshift-service-ca.crt config map by running the following command. Ensure that you encode the certificate in Base64 format and note the value to use in the next step.

```terminal
$ oc get cm/openshift-service-ca.crt \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.service-ca\.crt}' | base64 -w0; echo
```

Example output

```terminal
LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBDRVJUSUZJQ0FURS0...
....gpwOHMwaG9CRmk5a3....FLS0tLS0K
```

8. Configure the DataProtectionApplication CR manifest file with the bucket name and CA certificate as shown in the following example:
Example DataProtectionApplication CR

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
metadata:
  name: oadp-backup
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  configuration:
    nodeAgent:
      enable: true
      uploaderType: kopia
    velero:
      defaultPlugins:
        - aws
        - openshift
        - csi
      defaultSnapshotMoveData: true
  backupLocations:
    - velero:
        config:
          profile: "default"
          region: noobaa
          s3Url: https://s3.openshift-storage.svc
          s3ForcePathStyle: "true"
          insecureSkipTLSVerify: "false" 1
        provider: aws
        default: true
        credential:
          key: cloud
          name:  cloud-credentials
        objectStorage:
          bucket: <bucket_name> 2
          prefix: oadp
          caCert: <ca_cert> 3
```

The insecureSkipTLSVerify flag can be set to either true or false. If set to "true", SSL/TLS security is disabled. If set to false, SSL/TLS security is enabled.
Specify the name of the bucket extracted in an earlier step.
Copy and paste the Base64 encoded certificate from the previous step.
9. Create the DataProtectionApplication CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <dpa_filename>
```

10. Verify that the DataProtectionApplication CR is created successfully by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get dpa -o yaml
```

Example output

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
items:
- apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
  kind: DataProtectionApplication
  metadata:
    namespace: openshift-adp
    #...#
  spec:
    backupLocations:
    - velero:
        config:
          #...#
  status:
    conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: "20....9:54:02Z"
      message: Reconcile complete
      reason: Complete
      status: "True"
      type: Reconciled
kind: List
metadata:
  resourceVersion: ""
```

11. Verify that the backup storage location (BSL) is available by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get backupstoragelocations.velero.io -n openshift-adp
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME           PHASE       LAST VALIDATED   AGE   DEFAULT
dpa-sample-1   Available   3s               15s   true
```

12. Configure the Backup CR by using the following example:
Example Backup CR

```yaml
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: test-backup
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  includedNamespaces:
  - <application_namespace> 1
```

Specify the namespace for the application to back up.
13. Create the Backup CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <backup_cr_filename>
```


* Verify that the Backup object is in the Completed phase by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc describe backup test-backup -n openshift-adp
```

Example output

```terminal
Name:         test-backup
Namespace:    openshift-adp
# ....#

  Backup Item Operations Completed:  1
