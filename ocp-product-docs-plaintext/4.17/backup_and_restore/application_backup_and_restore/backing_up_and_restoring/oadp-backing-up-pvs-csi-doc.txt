# Backing up persistent volumes with CSI snapshots



You back up persistent volumes with Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots by editing the VolumeSnapshotClass custom resource (CR) of the cloud storage before you create the Backup CR, see CSI volume snapshots.

For more information, see Creating a Backup CR.

* The cloud provider must support CSI snapshots.
* You must enable CSI in the DataProtectionApplication CR.

* Add the metadata.labels.velero.io/csi-volumesnapshot-class: "true" key-value pair to the VolumeSnapshotClass CR:
Example configuration file

```yaml
apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: VolumeSnapshotClass
metadata:
  name: <volume_snapshot_class_name>
  labels:
    velero.io/csi-volumesnapshot-class: "true" 1
  annotations:
    snapshot.storage.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: true 2
driver: <csi_driver>
deletionPolicy: <deletion_policy_type> 3
```

Must be set to true.
Must be set to true.
OADP supports the Retain and Delete deletion policy types for CSI and Data Mover backup and restore. For the OADP 1.2 Data Mover, set the deletion policy type to Retain.

* You can now create a Backup CR.
