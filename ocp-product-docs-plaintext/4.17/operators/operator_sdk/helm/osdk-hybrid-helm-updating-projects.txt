# Updating Hybrid Helm-based projects for newer Operator SDK versions


Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.17 supports Operator SDK 1.31.0. If you already have the 1.28.0 CLI installed on your workstation, you can update the CLI to 1.31.0 by installing the latest version.

[IMPORTANT]
----
The Red Hat-supported version of the Operator SDK CLI tool, including the related scaffolding and testing tools for Operator projects, is deprecated and is planned to be removed in a future release of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. Red Hat will provide bug fixes and support for this feature during the current release lifecycle, but this feature will no longer receive enhancements and will be removed from future Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform releases.
The Red Hat-supported version of the Operator SDK is not recommended for creating new Operator projects. Operator authors with existing Operator projects can use the version of the Operator SDK CLI tool released with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.17 to maintain their projects and create Operator releases targeting newer versions of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
The following related base images for Operator projects are not deprecated. The runtime functionality and configuration APIs for these base images are still supported for bug fixes and for addressing CVEs.
* The base image for Ansible-based Operator projects
* The base image for Helm-based Operator projects
For the most recent list of major functionality that has been deprecated or removed within Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, refer to the Deprecated and removed features section of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release notes.
For information about the unsupported, community-maintained, version of the Operator SDK, see Operator SDK (Operator Framework).
----
However, to ensure your existing Operator projects maintain compatibility with Operator SDK 1.31.0, update steps are required for the associated breaking changes introduced since 1.28.0. You must perform the update steps manually in any of your Operator projects that were previously created or maintained with 1.28.0.

# Updating Hybrid Helm-based Operator projects for Operator SDK 1.31.0

The following procedure updates an existing {type}-based Operator project for compatibility with 1.31.0.

* Operator SDK 1.31.0 installed
* An Operator project created or maintained with Operator SDK 1.28.0

* Edit your Operator project's makefile to update the Operator SDK version to 1.31.0, as shown in the following example:
Example makefile

```make
# Set the Operator SDK version to use. By default, what is installed on the system is used.
# This is useful for CI or a project to utilize a specific version of the operator-sdk toolkit.
OPERATOR_SDK_VERSION ?= v1.31.0 1
```

Change the version from 1.28.0 to 1.31.0.
