# Ansible support in Operator SDK



[IMPORTANT]
----
The Red Hat-supported version of the Operator SDK CLI tool, including the related scaffolding and testing tools for Operator projects, is deprecated and is planned to be removed in a future release of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. Red Hat will provide bug fixes and support for this feature during the current release lifecycle, but this feature will no longer receive enhancements and will be removed from future Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform releases.
The Red Hat-supported version of the Operator SDK is not recommended for creating new Operator projects. Operator authors with existing Operator projects can use the version of the Operator SDK CLI tool released with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.17 to maintain their projects and create Operator releases targeting newer versions of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
The following related base images for Operator projects are not deprecated. The runtime functionality and configuration APIs for these base images are still supported for bug fixes and for addressing CVEs.
* The base image for Ansible-based Operator projects
* The base image for Helm-based Operator projects
For the most recent list of major functionality that has been deprecated or removed within Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, refer to the Deprecated and removed features section of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release notes.
For information about the unsupported, community-maintained, version of the Operator SDK, see Operator SDK (Operator Framework).

# Custom resource files

Operators use the Kubernetes extension mechanism, custom resource definitions (CRDs), so your custom resource (CR) looks and acts just like the built-in, native Kubernetes objects.

The CR file format is a Kubernetes resource file. The object has mandatory and optional fields:



The following list of CR annotations modify the behavior of the Operator:




```yaml
apiVersion: "test1.example.com/v1alpha1"
kind: "Test1"
metadata:
  name: "example"
annotations:
  ansible.operator-sdk/reconcile-period: "30s"
```


# watches.yaml file

A group/version/kind (GVK) is a unique identifier for a Kubernetes API. The watches.yaml file contains a list of mappings from custom resources (CRs), identified by its GVK, to an Ansible role or playbook. The Operator expects this mapping file in a predefined location at /opt/ansible/watches.yaml.




```yaml
- version: v1alpha1 1
  group: test1.example.com
  kind: Test1
  role: /opt/ansible/roles/Test1

- version: v1alpha1 2
  group: test2.example.com
  kind: Test2
  playbook: /opt/ansible/playbook.yml

- version: v1alpha1 3
  group: test3.example.com
  kind: Test3
  playbook: /opt/ansible/test3.yml
  reconcilePeriod: 0
  manageStatus: false
```


Simple example mapping Test1 to the test1 role.
Simple example mapping Test2 to a playbook.
More complex example for the Test3 kind. Disables re-queuing and managing the CR status in the playbook.

## Advanced options

Advanced features can be enabled by adding them to your watches.yaml file per GVK. They can go below the group, version, kind and playbook or role fields.

Some features can be overridden per resource using an annotation on that CR. The options that can be overridden have the annotation specified below.




```yaml
- version: v1alpha1
  group: app.example.com
  kind: AppService
  playbook: /opt/ansible/playbook.yml
  maxRunnerArtifacts: 30
  reconcilePeriod: 5s
  manageStatus: False
  watchDependentResources: False
```


# Extra variables sent to Ansible

Extra variables can be sent to Ansible, which are then managed by the Operator. The spec section of the custom resource (CR) passes along the key-value pairs as extra variables. This is equivalent to extra variables passed in to the ansible-playbook command.

The Operator also passes along additional variables under the meta field for the name of the CR and the namespace of the CR.

For the following CR example:


```yaml
apiVersion: "app.example.com/v1alpha1"
kind: "Database"
metadata:
  name: "example"
spec:
  message: "Hello world 2"
  newParameter: "newParam"
```


The structure passed to Ansible as extra variables is:


```json
{ "meta": {
        "name": "<cr_name>",
        "namespace": "<cr_namespace>",
  },
  "message": "Hello world 2",
  "new_parameter": "newParam",
  "_app_example_com_database": {
     <full_crd>
   },
}
```


The message and newParameter fields are set in the top level as extra variables, and meta provides the relevant metadata for the CR as defined in the Operator. The meta fields can be accessed using dot notation in Ansible, for example:


```yaml
---
- debug:
    msg: "name: {{ ansible_operator_meta.name }}, {{ ansible_operator_meta.namespace }}"
```


# Ansible Runner directory

Ansible Runner keeps information about Ansible runs in the container. This is located at /tmp/ansible-operator/runner/<group>/<version>/<kind>/<namespace>/<name>.

* To learn more about the runner directory, see the Ansible Runner documentation.
