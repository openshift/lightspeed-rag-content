# Migrating package manifest projects to bundle format


Support for the legacy package manifest format for Operators is removed in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.8 and later. If you have an Operator project that was initially created using the package manifest format, you can use the Operator SDK to migrate the project to the bundle format. The bundle format is the preferred packaging format for Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) starting in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.6.

[IMPORTANT]
----
The Red Hat-supported version of the Operator SDK CLI tool, including the related scaffolding and testing tools for Operator projects, is deprecated and is planned to be removed in a future release of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. Red Hat will provide bug fixes and support for this feature during the current release lifecycle, but this feature will no longer receive enhancements and will be removed from future Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform releases.
The Red Hat-supported version of the Operator SDK is not recommended for creating new Operator projects. Operator authors with existing Operator projects can use the version of the Operator SDK CLI tool released with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.17 to maintain their projects and create Operator releases targeting newer versions of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
The following related base images for Operator projects are not deprecated. The runtime functionality and configuration APIs for these base images are still supported for bug fixes and for addressing CVEs.
* The base image for Ansible-based Operator projects
* The base image for Helm-based Operator projects
For the most recent list of major functionality that has been deprecated or removed within Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, refer to the Deprecated and removed features section of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release notes.
For information about the unsupported, community-maintained, version of the Operator SDK, see Operator SDK (Operator Framework).

# About packaging format migration

The Operator SDK pkgman-to-bundle command helps in migrating Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) package manifests to bundles. The command takes an input package manifest directory and generates bundles for each of the versions of manifests present in the input directory. You can also then build bundle images for each of the generated bundles.

For example, consider the following packagemanifests/ directory for a project in the package manifest format:


```terminal
packagemanifests/
└── etcd
    ├── 0.0.1
    │   ├── etcdcluster.crd.yaml
    │   └── etcdoperator.clusterserviceversion.yaml
    ├── 0.0.2
    │   ├── etcdbackup.crd.yaml
    │   ├── etcdcluster.crd.yaml
    │   ├── etcdoperator.v0.0.2.clusterserviceversion.yaml
    │   └── etcdrestore.crd.yaml
    └── etcd.package.yaml
```


After running the migration, the following bundles are generated in the bundle/ directory:


```terminal
bundle/
├── bundle-0.0.1
│   ├── bundle.Dockerfile
│   ├── manifests
│   │   ├── etcdcluster.crd.yaml
│   │   ├── etcdoperator.clusterserviceversion.yaml
│   ├── metadata
│   │   └── annotations.yaml
│   └── tests
│       └── scorecard
│           └── config.yaml
└── bundle-0.0.2
    ├── bundle.Dockerfile
    ├── manifests
    │   ├── etcdbackup.crd.yaml
    │   ├── etcdcluster.crd.yaml
    │   ├── etcdoperator.v0.0.2.clusterserviceversion.yaml
    │   ├── etcdrestore.crd.yaml
    ├── metadata
    │   └── annotations.yaml
    └── tests
        └── scorecard
            └── config.yaml
```


Based on this generated layout, bundle images for both of the bundles are also built with the following names:

* quay.io/example/etcd:0.0.1
* quay.io/example/etcd:0.0.2

* Operator Framework packaging format

# Migrating a package manifest project to bundle format

Operator authors can use the Operator SDK to migrate a package manifest format Operator project to a bundle format project.

* Operator SDK CLI installed
* Operator project initially generated using the Operator SDK in package manifest format

* Use the Operator SDK to migrate your package manifest project to the bundle format and generate bundle images:

```terminal
$ operator-sdk pkgman-to-bundle <package_manifests_dir> \ 1
    [--output-dir <directory>] \ 2
    --image-tag-base <image_name_base> 3
```

Specify the location of the package manifests directory for the project, such as packagemanifests/ or manifests/.
Optional: By default, the generated bundles are written locally to disk to the bundle/ directory. You can use the --output-dir flag to specify an alternative location.
Set the --image-tag-base flag to provide the base of the image name, such as quay.io/example/etcd, that will be used for the bundles. Provide the name without a tag, because the tag for the images will be set according to the bundle version. For example, the full bundle image names are generated in the format <image_name_base>:<bundle_version>.

* Verify that the generated bundle image runs successfully:

```terminal
$ operator-sdk run bundle <bundle_image_name>:<tag>
```
