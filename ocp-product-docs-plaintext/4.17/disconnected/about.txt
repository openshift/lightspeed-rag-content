# About disconnected environments


A disconnected environment is an environment that does not have full access to the internet.
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is designed to perform many automatic functions that depend on an internet connection, such as retrieving release images from a registry or retrieving update paths and recommendations for the cluster.
Without a direct internet connection, you must perform additional setup and configuration for your cluster to maintain full functionality in the disconnected environment.

# Glossary of disconnected environment terms

Although it is used throughout the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform documentation, disconnected environment is a broad term that can refer to environments with various levels of internet connectivity.
Other terms are sometimes used to refer to a specific level of internet connectivity, and these environments might require additional unique configurations.

The following table describes the different terms used to refer to environments without a full internet connection:



# Preferred methods for working with disconnected environments

You can choose between multiple options for most aspects of managing a cluster in a disconnected environment.
For example, when mirroring images you can choose between using the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI (`oc`) plugin or using the oc adm command.

However, some options provide a simpler and more convenient user experience for disconnected environments, and are the preferred method over their alternatives.

Unless your organizational needs require you to choose another option, use the following methods for mirroring images, installing your cluster, and updating your cluster:

* Mirror your images using the oc-mirror plugin.
* Install your cluster using the Agent-based Installer.
* Update your cluster using a local OpenShift Update Service instance.
