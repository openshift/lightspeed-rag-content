# Red Hat OpenShift support for Windows Containers release notes



# Release notes for Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator 10.17.1

Issued: 9 June 2025

This release of the WMCO provides bug fixes for running Windows compute nodes in an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. The components of the WMCO 10.17.1 were released in RHSA-2025:8704.

## New features and improvements

### WMCO now defaults to info-level logging

The WMCO is configured to use the info log level by default. You can change the log level to debug by editing the WMCO subscription object.

For more information, see Configuring debug-level logging for the Windows Machine Config Operator.

## Bug fixes

* Previously, Windows nodes were unable to pull from image mirror registries if an organization name or namespace was included in the source of the ImageTagMirrorSet (ITMS) object. With this fix, you can include an organization name or namespace in the ITMS object. With this change, additional guidelines and requirements around using mirror registries have been added to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform documentation. For more information, see Using Windows containers with a mirror registry. (OCPBUGS-55915)
* Previously, the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform documentation lacked information about WMCO support for the installer-provisioned infrastructure (IPI) and the user-provisioned infrastructure (UPI) installation methods. With this fix, the documentation reports that the IPI method is the preferred installation method and can be used with all platforms. The UPI method is limited to specific use cases. For more information, see WMCO supported installation method. (OCPBUGS-44237)
