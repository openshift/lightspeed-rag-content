# Release notes for Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator 10.17.0

This release of the WMCO provides bug fixes for running Windows compute nodes in an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. The components of the WMCO 10.17.0 were released in RHSA-2024:7436.

## New features and improvements

### Kubernetes upgrade

The WMCO now uses Kubernetes 1.30.

## Bug fixes

* Previously, if a Windows VM had its PowerShell ExecutionPolicy set to Restricted, the Windows Instance Config Daemon (WICD) could not run the commands on that VM that are necessary for creating Windows nodes. With this fix, the WICD now bypasses the execution policy on the VM when running PowerShell commands. As a result, the WICD can create Windows nodes on the VM as expected. (OCPBUGS-30995)

* Previously, if reverse DNS lookup failed due to an error, such as the reverse DNS lookup services being unavailable, the WMCO would not fall back to using the VM hostname to determine if a certificate signing requests (CSR) should be approved. As a consequence, Bring-Your-Own-Host (BYOH) Windows nodes configured with an IP address would not become available. With this fix, BYOH nodes are properly added if reverse DNS is not available. (OCPBUGS-36643)

* Previously, if there were multiple service account token secrets in the WMCO namespace, scaling Windows nodes would fail. With this fix, the WMCO uses only the secret it creates, ignoring any other service account token secrets in the WMCO namespace. As a result, Windows nodes scale properly. (OCPBUGS-29253)
