# About image-based deployments for managed single-node OpenShift


When a host preinstalled with single-node OpenShift using an image-based installation arrives at a remote site, a technician can easily reconfigure and deploy the host in a matter of minutes.
For clusters with a hub-and-spoke architecture, to complete the deployment of a preinstalled host, you must first define site-specific configuration resources on the hub cluster for each host. These resources contain configuration information such as the properties of the bare-metal host, authentication details, and other deployment and networking information.
The Image Based Install (IBI) Operator creates a configuration ISO from these resources, and then boots the host with the configuration ISO attached. The host mounts the configuration ISO and runs the reconfiguration process. When the reconfiguration completes, the single-node OpenShift cluster is ready.

[NOTE]
----
You must create distinct configuration resources for each bare-metal host.
----
See the following high-level steps to deploy a preinstalled host in a cluster with a hub-and-spoke architecture:
1. Install the IBI Operator on the hub cluster.
2. Create site-specific configuration resources in the hub cluster for each host.
3. The IBI Operator creates a configuration ISO from these resources and boots the target host with the configuration ISO attached.
4. The host mounts the configuration ISO and runs the reconfiguration process. When the reconfiguration completes, the single-node OpenShift cluster is ready.

[NOTE]
----
Alternatively, you can manually deploy a preinstalled host for a cluster without using a hub cluster. You must define an ImageBasedConfig resource and an installation manifest, and provide these as inputs to the openshift-install installation program. For more information, see "Deploying a single-node OpenShift cluster using the openshift-install program".

# Installing the Image Based Install Operator

The Image Based Install (IBI) Operator is part of the image-based deployment workflow for preinstalled single-node OpenShift on bare-metal hosts.


[NOTE]
----
The IBI Operator is part of the multicluster engine for Kubernetes Operator from MCE version 2.7.
----

* You logged in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* You deployed a Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) hub cluster or you deployed the multicluster engine for Kubernetes Operator.
* You reviewed the required versions of software components in the section "Software prerequisites for an image-based installation".

* Set the enabled specification to true for the image-based-install-operator component in the MultiClusterEngine resource by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc patch multiclusterengines.multicluster.openshift.io multiclusterengine --type json \
--patch '[{"op": "add", "path":"/spec/overrides/components/-", "value": {"name":"image-based-install-operator","enabled": true}}]'
```


* Check that the Image Based Install Operator pod is running by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get pods -A | grep image-based
```

Example output

```terminal
multicluster-engine             image-based-install-operator-57fb8sc423-bxdj8             2/2     Running     0               5m
```


# Deploying a managed single-node OpenShift cluster using the IBI Operator

Create the site-specific configuration resources in the hub cluster to initiate the image-based deployment of a preinstalled host.

When you create these configuration resources in the hub cluster, the Image Based Install (IBI) Operator generates a configuration ISO and attaches it to the target host to begin the site-specific configuration  process. When the configuration process completes, the single-node OpenShift cluster is ready.


[NOTE]
----
For more information about the configuration resources that you must configure in the hub cluster, see "Cluster configuration resources for deploying a preinstalled host".
----

* You preinstalled a host with single-node OpenShift using an image-based installation.

## Cluster configuration resources for deploying a preinstalled host

To complete a deployment for a preinstalled host at a remote site, you must configure the following site-specifc cluster configuration resources in the hub cluster for each bare-metal host.



## ImageClusterInstall resource API specifications

The following content describes the API specifications for the ImageClusterInstall resource. This resource is the endpoint for the Image Based Install Operator.





# ConfigMap resources for extra manifests

You can optionally create a ConfigMap resource to define additional manifests in an image-based deployment for managed single-node OpenShift clusters.

After you create the ConfigMap resource, reference it in the ImageClusterInstall resource. During deployment, the IBI Operator includes the extra manifests in the deployment.

## Creating a ConfigMap resource to add extra manifests in an image-based deployment

You can use a ConfigMap resource to add extra manifests to the image-based deployment for single-node OpenShift clusters.

The following example adds an single-root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) network to the deployment.

* You preinstalled a host with single-node OpenShift using an image-based installation.
* You logged in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

1. Create the SriovNetworkNodePolicy and SriovNetwork resources:
1. Create a YAML file that defines the resources:
Example sriov-extra-manifest.yaml file

```yaml
apiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1
kind: SriovNetworkNodePolicy
metadata:
  name: "example-sriov-node-policy"
  namespace: openshift-sriov-network-operator
spec:
  deviceType: vfio-pci
  isRdma: false
  nicSelector:
    pfNames: [ens1f0]
  nodeSelector:
    node-role.kubernetes.io/master: ""
  mtu: 1500
  numVfs: 8
  priority: 99
  resourceName: example-sriov-node-policy
---
apiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1
kind: SriovNetwork
metadata:
  name: "example-sriov-network"
  namespace: openshift-sriov-network-operator
spec:
  ipam: |-
    {
    }
  linkState: auto
  networkNamespace: sriov-namespace
  resourceName: example-sriov-node-policy
  spoofChk: "on"
  trust: "off"
```

2. Create the ConfigMap resource by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create configmap sr-iov-extra-manifest --from-file=sriov-extra-manifest.yaml -n ibi-ns 1
```

Specify the namespace that has the ImageClusterInstall resource.
Example output

```terminal
configmap/sr-iov-extra-manifest created
```

2. Reference the ConfigMap resource in the spec.extraManifestsRefs field of the ImageClusterInstall resource:

```yaml
#...
  spec:
    extraManifestsRefs:
    - name: sr-iov-extra-manifest
#...
```


## Creating a ConfigMap resource to add a CA bundle in an image-based deployment

You can use a ConfigMap resource to add a certificate authority (CA) bundle to the host to ensure trusted communications for cluster services.

After you create the ConfigMap resource, reference it in the spec.caBundleRef field of the ImageClusterInstall resource.

* You preinstalled a host with single-node OpenShift using an image-based installation.
* You logged in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

1. Create a CA bundle file such as the following file:
Example example-ca.crt

```text
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIDXTCCAkWgAwIBAgIJAKmjYKJbIyz3MA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAMEUxCzAJBgNV
...Custom CA certificate bundle...
4WPl0Qb27Sb1xZyAsy1ww6MYb98EovazUSfjYr2EVF6ThcAPu4/sMxUV7He2J6Jd
cA8SMRwpUbz3LXY=
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

2. Create the ConfigMap object by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create configmap custom-ca --from-file=example-ca.crt -n ibi-ns 1
```

Specify the namespace that has the ImageClusterInstall resource.
Example output

```terminal
configmap/custom-ca created
```

3. Reference the ConfigMap resource in the spec.caBundleRef field of the ImageClusterInstall resource:

```yaml
#...
  spec:
    caBundleRef:
      name: custom-ca
#...
```
