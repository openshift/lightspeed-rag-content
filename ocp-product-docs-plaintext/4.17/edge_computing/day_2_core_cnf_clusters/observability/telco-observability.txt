# Observability in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform


Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform generates a large amount of data, such as performance metrics and logs from both the platform and the workloads running on it.
As an administrator, you can use various tools to collect and analyze all the data available.
What follows is an outline of best practices for system engineers, architects, and administrators configuring the observability stack.
Unless explicitly stated, the material in this document refers to both Edge and Core deployments.

# Understanding the monitoring stack

The monitoring stack uses the following components:

* Prometheus collects and analyzes metrics from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform components and from workloads, if configured to do so.
* Alertmanager is a component of Prometheus that handles routing, grouping, and silencing of alerts.
* Thanos handles long term storage of metrics.

[NOTE]
----
For a single-node OpenShift cluster, you should disable Alertmanager and Thanos because the cluster sends all metrics to the hub cluster for analysis and retention.

* Core platform monitoring first steps

# Key performance metrics

Depending on your system, there can be hundreds of available measurements.

Here are some key metrics that you should pay attention to:

* etcd response times
* API response times
* Pod restarts and scheduling
* Resource usage
* OVN health
* Overall cluster operator health

A good rule to follow is that if you decide that a metric is important, there should be an alert for it.


[NOTE]
----
You can check the available metrics by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring exec -c prometheus prometheus-k8s-0 -- curl -qsk http://localhost:9090/api/v1/metadata | jq '.data
```

----

## Example queries in PromQL

The following tables show some queries that you can explore in the metrics query browser using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform console.


[NOTE]
----
The URL for the console is https://<OpenShift Console FQDN>/monitoring/query-browser.
You can get the OpenShift Console FQDN by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get routes -n openshift-console console -o jsonpath='{.status.ingress[0].host}'
```

----









## Recommendations for storage of metrics

Out of the box, Prometheus does not back up saved metrics with persistent storage.
If you restart the Prometheus pods, all metrics data are lost.
You should configure the monitoring stack to use the back-end storage that is available on the platform.
To meet the high IO demands of Prometheus you should use local storage.

For Telco core clusters, you can use the Local Storage Operator for persistent storage for Prometheus.

Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF), which deploys a ceph cluster for block, file, and object storage, is also a suitable candidate for a Telco core cluster.

To keep system resource requirements low on a RAN single-node OpenShift or far edge cluster, you should not provision backend storage for the monitoring stack.
Such clusters forward all metrics to the hub cluster where you can provision a third party monitoring platform.

* Accessing metrics as an administrator
* Cluster tuning reference CRs
* Persistent storage using local volumes

# Monitoring the edge

Single-node OpenShift at the edge keeps the footprint of the platform components to a minimum.
The following procedure is an example of how you can configure a single-node OpenShift node with a small monitoring footprint.

* For environments that use Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM), you have enabled the Observability service.
* The hub cluster is running Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF).

1. Create a ConfigMap CR, and save it as monitoringConfigMap.yaml, as in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
 name: cluster-monitoring-config
 namespace: openshift-monitoring
 data:
 config.yaml: |
   alertmanagerMain:
     enabled: false
   telemeterClient:
     enabled: false
   prometheusK8s:
      retention: 24h
```

2. On the single-node OpenShift, apply the ConfigMap CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f monitoringConfigMap.yaml
```

3. Create a NameSpace CR, and save it as monitoringNamespace.yaml, as in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: open-cluster-management-observability
```

4. On the hub cluster, apply the Namespace CR on the hub cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f monitoringNamespace.yaml
```

5. Create an ObjectBucketClaim CR, and save it as monitoringObjectBucketClaim.yaml, as in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: objectbucket.io/v1alpha1
kind: ObjectBucketClaim
metadata:
  name: multi-cloud-observability
  namespace: open-cluster-management-observability
spec:
  storageClassName: openshift-storage.noobaa.io
  generateBucketName: acm-multi
```

6. On the hub cluster, apply the ObjectBucketClaim CR, by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f monitoringObjectBucketClaim.yaml
```

7. Create a Secret CR, and save it as monitoringSecret.yaml, as in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: multiclusterhub-operator-pull-secret
  namespace: open-cluster-management-observability
stringData:
  .dockerconfigjson: 'PULL_SECRET'
```

8. On the hub cluster, apply the Secret CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f monitoringSecret.yaml
```

9. Get the keys for the NooBaa service and the backend bucket name from the hub cluster by running the following commands:

```terminal
$ NOOBAA_ACCESS_KEY=$(oc get secret noobaa-admin -n openshift-storage -o json | jq -r '.data.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID|@base64d')
```


```terminal
$ NOOBAA_SECRET_KEY=$(oc get secret noobaa-admin -n openshift-storage -o json | jq -r '.data.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY|@base64d')
```


```terminal
$ OBJECT_BUCKET=$(oc get objectbucketclaim -n open-cluster-management-observability multi-cloud-observability -o json | jq -r .spec.bucketName)
```

10. Create a Secret CR for bucket storage and save it as monitoringBucketSecret.yaml, as in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: thanos-object-storage
  namespace: open-cluster-management-observability
type: Opaque
stringData:
  thanos.yaml: |
    type: s3
    config:
      bucket: ${OBJECT_BUCKET}
      endpoint: s3.openshift-storage.svc
      insecure: true
      access_key: ${NOOBAA_ACCESS_KEY}
      secret_key: ${NOOBAA_SECRET_KEY}
```

11. On the hub cluster, apply the Secret CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f monitoringBucketSecret.yaml
```

12. Create the MultiClusterObservability CR and save it as monitoringMultiClusterObservability.yaml, as in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: observability.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta2
kind: MultiClusterObservability
metadata:
  name: observability
spec:
  advanced:
    retentionConfig:
      blockDuration: 2h
      deleteDelay: 48h
      retentionInLocal: 24h
      retentionResolutionRaw: 3d
  enableDownsampling: false
  observabilityAddonSpec:
    enableMetrics: true
    interval: 300
  storageConfig:
    alertmanagerStorageSize: 10Gi
    compactStorageSize: 100Gi
    metricObjectStorage:
      key: thanos.yaml
      name: thanos-object-storage
    receiveStorageSize: 25Gi
    ruleStorageSize: 10Gi
    storeStorageSize: 25Gi
```

13. On the hub cluster, apply the MultiClusterObservability CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f monitoringMultiClusterObservability.yaml
```


1. Check the routes and pods in the namespace to validate that the services have deployed on the hub cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get routes,pods -n open-cluster-management-observability
```

Example output

```terminal

```

A dashboard is accessible at the grafana route listed. You can use this to view metrics across all managed clusters.

For more information on observability in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management, see Observability.

# Alerting

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform includes a large number of alert rules, which can change from release to release.

## Viewing default alerts

Use the following procedure to review all of the alert rules in a cluster.

* To review all the alert rules in a cluster, you can run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get cm -n openshift-monitoring prometheus-k8s-rulefiles-0 -o yaml
```


Rules can include a description and provide a link to additional information and mitigation steps.
For example, this is the rule for etcdHighFsyncDurations:

```terminal
      - alert: etcdHighFsyncDurations
        annotations:
          description: 'etcd cluster "{{ $labels.job }}": 99th percentile fsync durations
            are {{ $value }}s on etcd instance {{ $labels.instance }}.'
          runbook_url: https://github.com/openshift/runbooks/blob/master/alerts/cluster-etcd-operator/etcdHighFsyncDurations.md
          summary: etcd cluster 99th percentile fsync durations are too high.
        expr: |
          histogram_quantile(0.99, rate(etcd_disk_wal_fsync_duration_seconds_bucket{job=~".*etcd.*"}[5m]))
          > 1
        for: 10m
        labels:
          severity: critical
```


## Alert notifications

You can view alerts in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform console, however an administrator should configure an external receiver to forward the alerts to.
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform supports the following receiver types:

* PagerDuty: a 3rd party incident response platform
* Webhook: an arbitrary API endpoint that receives an alert via a POST request and can take any necessary action
* Email: sends an email to designated address
* Slack: sends a notification to either a slack channel or an individual user

* Managing alerts

# Workload monitoring

By default, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform does not collect metrics for application workloads. You can configure a cluster to collect workload metrics.

* You have defined endpoints to gather workload metrics on the cluster.

1. Create a ConfigMap CR and save it as monitoringConfigMap.yaml, as in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    enableUserWorkload: true 1
```

Set to true to enable workload monitoring.
2. Apply the ConfigMap CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f monitoringConfigMap.yaml
```

3. Create a ServiceMonitor CR, and save it as monitoringServiceMonitor.yaml, as in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  labels:
    app: ui
  name: myapp
  namespace: myns
spec:
  endpoints: 1
  - interval: 30s
    port: ui-http
    scheme: http
    path: /healthz 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: ui
```

Use endpoints to define workload metrics.
Prometheus scrapes the path /metrics by default. You can define a custom path here.
4. Apply the ServiceMonitor CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f monitoringServiceMonitor.yaml
```


Prometheus scrapes the path /metrics by default, however you can define a custom path.
It is up to the vendor of the application to expose this endpoint for scraping, with metrics that they deem relevant.

## Creating a workload alert

You can enable alerts for user workloads on a cluster.

1. Create a ConfigMap CR, and save it as monitoringConfigMap.yaml, as in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    enableUserWorkload: true 1
# ...
```

Set to true to enable workload monitoring.
2. Apply the ConfigMap CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f monitoringConfigMap.yaml
```

3. Create a YAML file for alerting rules, monitoringAlertRule.yaml, as in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  name: myapp-alert
  namespace: myns
spec:
  groups:
  - name: example
    rules:
    - alert: InternalErrorsAlert
      expr: flask_http_request_total{status="500"} > 0
# ...
```

4. Apply the alert rule by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f monitoringAlertRule.yaml
```
