# Handling machine configuration for hosted control planes


In a standalone Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, a machine config pool manages a set of nodes. You can handle a machine configuration by using the MachineConfigPool custom resource (CR).

[TIP]
----
You can reference any machineconfiguration.openshift.io resources in the nodepool.spec.config field of the NodePool CR.
----
In hosted control planes, the MachineConfigPool CR does not exist. A node pool contains a set of compute nodes. You can handle a machine configuration by using node pools.

# Configuring node pools for hosted control planes

On hosted control planes, you can configure node pools by creating a MachineConfig object inside of a config map in the management cluster.

1. To create a MachineConfig object inside of a config map in the management cluster, enter the following information:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: <configmap_name>
  namespace: clusters
data:
  config: |
    apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
    kind: MachineConfig
    metadata:
      labels:
        machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
      name: <machineconfig_name>
    spec:
      config:
        ignition:
          version: 3.2.0
        storage:
          files:
          - contents:
              source: data:...
            mode: 420
            overwrite: true
            path: ${PATH} 1
```

Sets the path on the node where the MachineConfig object is stored.
2. After you add the object to the config map, you can apply the config map to the node pool as follows:

```yaml
$ oc edit nodepool <nodepool_name> --namespace <hosted_cluster_namespace>
```


```yaml
apiVersion: hypershift.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: NodePool
metadata:
# ...
  name: nodepool-1
  namespace: clusters
# ...
spec:
  config:
  - name: <configmap_name> 1
# ...
```

Replace <configmap_name> with the name of your config map.

# Referencing the kubelet configuration in node pools

To reference your kubelet configuration in node pools, you add the kubelet configuration in a config map and then apply the config map in the NodePool resource.

1. Add the kubelet configuration inside of a config map in the management cluster by entering the following information:
Example ConfigMap object with the kubelet configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: <configmap_name> 1
  namespace: clusters
data:
  config: |
    apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
    kind: KubeletConfig
    metadata:
      name: <kubeletconfig_name> 2
    spec:
      kubeletConfig:
        registerWithTaints:
        - key: "example.sh/unregistered"
          value: "true"
          effect: "NoExecute"
```

Replace <configmap_name> with the name of your config map.
Replace <kubeletconfig_name> with the name of the KubeletConfig resource.
2. Apply the config map to the node pool by entering the following command:

```yaml
$ oc edit nodepool <nodepool_name> --namespace clusters 1
```

Replace <nodepool_name> with the name of your node pool.
Example NodePool resource configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: hypershift.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: NodePool
metadata:
# ...
  name: nodepool-1
  namespace: clusters
# ...
spec:
  config:
  - name: <configmap_name> 1
# ...
```

Replace <configmap_name> with the name of your config map.

# Configuring node tuning in a hosted cluster

To set node-level tuning on the nodes in your hosted cluster, you can use the Node Tuning Operator. In hosted control planes, you can configure node tuning by creating config maps that contain Tuned objects and referencing those config maps in your node pools.

1. Create a config map that contains a valid tuned manifest, and reference the manifest in a node pool. In the following example, a Tuned manifest defines a profile that sets vm.dirty_ratio to 55 on nodes that contain the tuned-1-node-label node label with any value. Save the following ConfigMap manifest in a file named tuned-1.yaml:

```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: tuned-1
      namespace: clusters
    data:
      tuning: |
        apiVersion: tuned.openshift.io/v1
        kind: Tuned
        metadata:
          name: tuned-1
          namespace: openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator
        spec:
          profile:
          - data: |
              [main]
              summary=Custom OpenShift profile
              include=openshift-node
              [sysctl]
              vm.dirty_ratio="55"
            name: tuned-1-profile
          recommend:
          - priority: 20
            profile: tuned-1-profile
```


[NOTE]
----
If you do not add any labels to an entry in the spec.recommend section of the Tuned spec, node-pool-based matching is assumed, so the highest priority profile in the spec.recommend section is applied to nodes in the pool. Although you can achieve more fine-grained node-label-based matching by setting a label value in the Tuned .spec.recommend.match section, node labels will not persist during an upgrade unless you set the .spec.management.upgradeType value of the node pool to InPlace.
----
2. Create the ConfigMap object in the management cluster:

```terminal
$ oc --kubeconfig="$MGMT_KUBECONFIG" create -f tuned-1.yaml
```

3. Reference the ConfigMap object in the spec.tuningConfig field of the node pool, either by editing a node pool or creating one. In this example, assume that you have only one NodePool, named nodepool-1, which contains 2 nodes.

```yaml
    apiVersion: hypershift.openshift.io/v1alpha1
    kind: NodePool
    metadata:
      ...
      name: nodepool-1
      namespace: clusters
    ...
    spec:
      ...
      tuningConfig:
      - name: tuned-1
    status:
    ...
```


[NOTE]
----
You can reference the same config map in multiple node pools. In hosted control planes, the Node Tuning Operator appends a hash of the node pool name and namespace to the name of the Tuned CRs to distinguish them. Outside of this case, do not create multiple TuneD profiles of the same name in different Tuned CRs for the same hosted cluster.
----

Now that you have created the ConfigMap object that contains a Tuned manifest and referenced it in a NodePool, the Node Tuning Operator syncs the Tuned objects into the hosted cluster. You can verify which Tuned objects are defined and which TuneD profiles are applied to each node.

1. List the Tuned objects in the hosted cluster:

```terminal
$ oc --kubeconfig="$HC_KUBECONFIG" get tuned.tuned.openshift.io \
  -n openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME       AGE
default    7m36s
rendered   7m36s
tuned-1    65s
```

2. List the Profile objects in the hosted cluster:

```terminal
$ oc --kubeconfig="$HC_KUBECONFIG" get profile.tuned.openshift.io \
  -n openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                           TUNED            APPLIED   DEGRADED   AGE
nodepool-1-worker-1            tuned-1-profile  True      False      7m43s
nodepool-1-worker-2            tuned-1-profile  True      False      7m14s
```


[NOTE]
----
If no custom profiles are created, the openshift-node profile is applied by default.
----
3. To confirm that the tuning was applied correctly, start a debug shell on a node and check the sysctl values:

```terminal
$ oc --kubeconfig="$HC_KUBECONFIG" \
  debug node/nodepool-1-worker-1 -- chroot /host sysctl vm.dirty_ratio
```

Example output

```terminal
vm.dirty_ratio = 55
```


# Deploying the SR-IOV Operator for hosted control planes

After you configure and deploy your hosting service cluster, you can create a subscription to the SR-IOV Operator on a hosted cluster. The SR-IOV pod runs on worker machines rather than the control plane.

You must configure and deploy the hosted cluster on AWS.

1. Create a namespace and an Operator group:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: openshift-sriov-network-operator
---
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: sriov-network-operators
  namespace: openshift-sriov-network-operator
spec:
  targetNamespaces:
  - openshift-sriov-network-operator
```

2. Create a subscription to the SR-IOV Operator:

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: sriov-network-operator-subsription
  namespace: openshift-sriov-network-operator
spec:
  channel: stable
  name: sriov-network-operator
  config:
    nodeSelector:
      node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ""
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
```


1. To verify that the SR-IOV Operator is ready, run the following command and view the resulting output:

```terminal
$ oc get csv -n openshift-sriov-network-operator
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                                         DISPLAY                   VERSION               REPLACES                                     PHASE
sriov-network-operator.4.17.0-202211021237   SR-IOV Network Operator   4.17.0-202211021237   sriov-network-operator.4.17.0-202210290517   Succeeded
```

2. To verify that the SR-IOV pods are deployed, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get pods -n openshift-sriov-network-operator
```


# Configuring the NTP server for hosted clusters

You can configure the Network Time Protocol (NTP) server for your hosted clusters by using Butane.

1. Create a Butane config file, 99-worker-chrony.bu, that includes the contents of the chrony.conf file. For more information about Butane, see "Creating machine configs with Butane".
Example 99-worker-chrony.bu configuration

```yaml
# ...
variant: openshift
version: 4.17.0
metadata:
  name: 99-worker-chrony
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
storage:
  files:
  - path: /etc/chrony.conf
    mode: 0644  1
    overwrite: true
    contents:
      inline: |
        pool 0.rhel.pool.ntp.org iburst  2
        driftfile /var/lib/chrony/drift
        makestep 1.0 3
        rtcsync
        logdir /var/log/chrony
# ...
```

Specify an octal value mode for the mode field in the machine config file. After creating the file and applying the changes, the mode field is converted to a decimal value.
Specify any valid, reachable time source, such as the one provided by your Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server.

[NOTE]
----
For machine-to-machine communication, the NTP on the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port is 123. If you configured an external NTP time server, you must open UDP port 123.
----
2. Use Butane to generate a MachineConfig object file, 99-worker-chrony.yaml, that contains a configuration that Butane sends to the nodes. Run the following command:

```terminal
$ butane 99-worker-chrony.bu -o 99-worker-chrony.yaml
```

Example 99-worker-chrony.yaml configuration

```yaml
# Generated by Butane; do not edit
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
  name: <machineconfig_name>
spec:
  config:
    ignition:
      version: 3.2.0
    storage:
      files:
        - contents:
            source: data:...
          mode: 420
          overwrite: true
          path: /example/path
```

3. Add the contents of the 99-worker-chrony.yaml file inside of a config map in the management cluster:
Example config map

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: <configmap_name>
  namespace: <namespace>  1
data:
  config: |
    apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
    kind: MachineConfig
    metadata:
      labels:
        machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
      name: <machineconfig_name>
    spec:
      config:
        ignition:
          version: 3.2.0
        storage:
          files:
          - contents:
              source: data:...
            mode: 420
            overwrite: true
            path: /example/path
# ...
```

Replace <namespace> with the name of your namespace where you created the node pool, such as clusters.
4. Apply the config map to your node pool by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc edit nodepool <nodepool_name> --namespace <hosted_cluster_namespace>
```

Example NodePool configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: hypershift.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: NodePool
metadata:
# ...
  name: nodepool-1
  namespace: clusters
# ...
spec:
  config:
  - name: <configmap_name> 1
# ...
```

Replace <configmap_name> with the name of your config map.
5. Add the list of your NTP servers in the infra-env.yaml file, which defines the InfraEnv custom resource (CR):
Example infra-env.yaml file

```yaml
apiVersion: agent-install.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: InfraEnv
# ...
spec:
  additionalNTPSources:
  - <ntp_server> 1
  - <ntp_server1>
  - <ntp_server2>
# ...
```

Replace <ntp_server> with the name of your NTP server. For more details about creating a host inventory and the InfraEnv CR, see "Creating a host inventory".
6. Apply the InfraEnv CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f infra-env.yaml
```


* Check the following fields to know the status of your host inventory:
* conditions:  The standard Kubernetes conditions indicating if the image was created successfully.
* isoDownloadURL: The URL to download the Discovery Image.
* createdTime: The time at which the image was last created. If you modify the InfraEnv CR, ensure that you have updated the timestamp before downloading a new image.

Verify that your host inventory is created by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc describe infraenv <infraenv_resource_name> -n <infraenv_namespace>
```


[NOTE]
----
If you modify the InfraEnv CR, confirm that the InfraEnv CR has created a new Discovery Image by looking at the createdTime field. If you already booted hosts, boot them again with the latest Discovery Image.
