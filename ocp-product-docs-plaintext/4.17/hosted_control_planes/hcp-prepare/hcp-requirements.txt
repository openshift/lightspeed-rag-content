# Requirements for hosted control planes


In the context of hosted control planes, a management cluster is an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster where the HyperShift Operator is deployed and where the control planes for hosted clusters are hosted. The management cluster and workers must run on the same infrastructure. For example, you cannot run your management cluster on bare metal and your workers on the cloud. However, the management cluster and workers do not need to run on the same platform. For example, you might run your management cluster on bare metal and workers on OpenShift Virtualization.
The control plane is associated with a hosted cluster and runs as pods in a single namespace. When the cluster service consumer creates a hosted cluster, it creates a worker node that is independent of the control plane.

# Support matrix for hosted control planes

Because multicluster engine for Kubernetes Operator includes the HyperShift Operator, releases of hosted control planes align with releases of multicluster engine Operator. For more information, see OpenShift Operator Life Cycles.

## Management cluster support

Any supported standalone Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster can be a management cluster. The following table maps multicluster engine Operator versions to the management cluster versions that support them:



## Hosted cluster support

For hosted clusters, no direct relationship exists the management cluster version and the hosted cluster version. The hosted cluster version depends on the HyperShift Operator that is included with your multicluster engine Operator version. The following table maps multicluster engine Operator versions to which hosted cluster versions you can create by using the HyperShift Operator that is associated with that version of multicluster engine Operator:



## Hosted cluster platform support

The following table indicates which Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform versions are supported for each platform of hosted control planes. In the table, Management cluster version refers to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version where the multicluster engine Operator is enabled:



## Updates of multicluster engine Operator

When you update to another version of the multicluster engine Operator, your hosted cluster can continue to run if the HyperShift Operator that is included in the version of multicluster engine Operator supports the hosted cluster version. The following table shows which hosted cluster versions are supported on which updated multicluster engine Operator versions:



For example, if you have an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14 hosted cluster on the management cluster and you update from multicluster engine Operator 2.4 to 2.5, the hosted cluster can continue to run.
