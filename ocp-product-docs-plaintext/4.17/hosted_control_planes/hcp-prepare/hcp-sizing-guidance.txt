# Sizing guidance for hosted control planes


Many factors, including hosted cluster workload and worker node count, affect how many hosted control planes can fit within a certain number of worker nodes. Use this sizing guide to help with hosted cluster capacity planning. This guidance assumes a highly available hosted control planes topology. The load-based sizing examples were measured on a bare-metal cluster. Cloud-based instances might have different limiting factors, such as memory size.
You can override the following resource utilization sizing measurements and disable the metric service monitoring.
See the following highly available hosted control planes requirements, which were tested with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.12.9 and later:
* 78 pods
* Three 8 GiB PVs for etcd
* Minimum vCPU: approximately 5.5 cores
* Minimum memory: approximately 19 GiB
* Overriding resource utilization measurements
* Distributing hosted cluster workloads

# Pod limits

The maxPods setting for each node affects how many hosted clusters can fit in a control-plane node. It is important to note the maxPods value on all control-plane nodes. Plan for about 75 pods for each highly available hosted control plane.

For bare-metal nodes, the default maxPods setting of 250 is likely to be a limiting factor because roughly three hosted control planes fit for each node given the pod requirements, even if the machine has plenty of resources to spare. Setting the maxPods value to 500 by configuring the KubeletConfig value allows for greater hosted control plane density, which can help you take advantage of additional compute resources.

* Configuring the maximum number of pods per node

# Request-based resource limit

The maximum number of hosted control planes that the cluster can host is calculated based on the hosted control plane CPU and memory requests from the pods.

A highly available hosted control plane consists of 78 pods that request 5 vCPUs and 18 GB memory. These baseline numbers are compared to the cluster worker node resource capacities to estimate the maximum number of hosted control planes.

# Load-based limit

The maximum number of hosted control planes that the cluster can host is calculated based on the hosted control plane pods CPU and memory utilizations when some workload is put on the hosted control plane Kubernetes API server.

The following method is used to measure the hosted control plane resource utilizations as the workload increases:

* A hosted cluster with 9 workers that use 8 vCPU and 32 GiB each, while using the KubeVirt platform
* The workload test profile that is configured to focus on API control-plane stress, based on the following definition:
* Created objects for each namespace, scaling up to 100 namespaces total
* Additional API stress with continuous object deletion and creation
* Workload queries-per-second (QPS) and Burst settings set high to remove any client-side throttling

As the load increases by 1000 QPS, the hosted control plane resource utilization increases by 9 vCPUs and 2.5 GB memory.

For general sizing purposes, consider the 1000 QPS API rate that is a medium hosted cluster load, and a 2000 QPS API that is a heavy hosted cluster load.


[NOTE]
----
This test provides an estimation factor to increase the compute resource utilization based on the expected API load. Exact utilization rates can vary based on the type and pace of the cluster workload.

The following example shows hosted control plane resource scaling for the workload and API rate definitions:



The hosted control plane sizing is about control-plane load and workloads that cause heavy API activity, etcd activity, or both. Hosted pod workloads that focus on data-plane loads, such as running a database, might not result in high API rates.

# Sizing calculation example

This example provides sizing guidance for the following scenario:

* Three bare-metal workers that are labeled as hypershift.openshift.io/control-plane nodes
* maxPods value set to 500
* The expected API rate is medium or about 1000, according to the load-based limits







# Shared infrastructure between hosted and standalone control planes

As a service provider, you can more effectively use your resources by sharing infrastructure between a standalone Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform control plane and hosted control planes. A 3-node Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster can be a management cluster for a hosted cluster.

Sharing infrastructure can be beneficial in constrained environments, such as in small-scale deployments where you need resource efficiency.

Before you share infrastructure, ensure that your infrastructure has enough resources to support hosted control planes. On the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform management cluster, nothing else can be deployed except hosted control planes. Ensure that the management cluster has enough CPU, memory, storage, and network resources to handle the combined load of the hosted clusters. For more information, see "Sizing guidance for hosted control planes".

Workload must not be demanding, and it must fall within a low queries-per-second (QPS) profile. To maintain a reasonable risk profile, you can share up to 3 hosted clusters.
