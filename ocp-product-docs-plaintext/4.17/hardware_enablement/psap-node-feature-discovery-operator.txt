# Node Feature Discovery Operator


Learn about the Node Feature Discovery (NFD) Operator and how you can use it to expose node-level information by orchestrating Node Feature Discovery, a Kubernetes add-on for detecting hardware features and system configuration.
The Node Feature Discovery Operator (NFD) manages the detection of hardware features and configuration in an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster by labeling the nodes with hardware-specific information. NFD labels the host with node-specific attributes, such as PCI cards, kernel, operating system version, and so on.
The NFD Operator can be found on the Operator Hub by searching for “Node Feature Discovery”.

# Installing the Node Feature Discovery Operator

The Node Feature Discovery (NFD) Operator orchestrates all resources needed to run the NFD daemon set. As a cluster administrator, you can install the NFD Operator by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI or the web console.

## Installing the NFD Operator using the CLI

As a cluster administrator, you can install the NFD Operator using the CLI.

* An Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster
* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

1. Create a namespace for the NFD Operator.
1. Create the following Namespace custom resource (CR) that defines the openshift-nfd namespace, and then save the YAML in the nfd-namespace.yaml file. Set cluster-monitoring to "true".

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: openshift-nfd
  labels:
    name: openshift-nfd
    openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"
```

2. Create the namespace by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f nfd-namespace.yaml
```

2. Install the NFD Operator in the namespace you created in the previous step by creating the following objects:
1. Create the following OperatorGroup CR and save the YAML in the nfd-operatorgroup.yaml file:

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  generateName: openshift-nfd-
  name: openshift-nfd
  namespace: openshift-nfd
spec:
  targetNamespaces:
  - openshift-nfd
```

2. Create the OperatorGroup CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f nfd-operatorgroup.yaml
```

3. Create the following Subscription CR and save the YAML in the nfd-sub.yaml file:
Example Subscription

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: nfd
  namespace: openshift-nfd
spec:
  channel: "stable"
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
  name: nfd
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
```

4. Create the subscription object by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f nfd-sub.yaml
```

5. Change to the openshift-nfd project:

```terminal
$ oc project openshift-nfd
```


* To verify that the Operator deployment is successful, run:

```terminal
$ oc get pods
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nfd-controller-manager-7f86ccfb58-vgr4x   2/2     Running   0          10m
```


A successful deployment shows a Running status.

## Installing the NFD Operator using the web console

As a cluster administrator, you can install the NFD Operator using the web console.

1. In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, click Operators -> OperatorHub.
2. Choose Node Feature Discovery from the list of available Operators, and then click Install.
3. On the Install Operator page, select A specific namespace on the cluster, and then click Install. You do not need to create a namespace because it is created for you.

To verify that the NFD Operator installed successfully:

1. Navigate to the Operators -> Installed Operators page.
2. Ensure that Node Feature Discovery is listed in the openshift-nfd project with a Status of InstallSucceeded.

[NOTE]
----
During installation an Operator might display a Failed status. If the installation later succeeds with an InstallSucceeded message, you can ignore the Failed message.
----

If the Operator does not appear as installed, troubleshoot further:

1. Navigate to the Operators -> Installed Operators page and inspect the Operator Subscriptions and Install Plans tabs for any failure or errors under Status.
2. Navigate to the Workloads -> Pods page and check the logs for pods in the openshift-nfd project.

# Using the Node Feature Discovery Operator

The Node Feature Discovery (NFD) Operator orchestrates all resources needed to run the Node-Feature-Discovery daemon set by watching for a NodeFeatureDiscovery custom resource (CR). Based on the NodeFeatureDiscovery CR, the Operator creates the operand (NFD) components in the selected namespace. You can edit the CR to use another namespace, image, image pull policy, and nfd-worker-conf config map, among other options.

As a cluster administrator, you can create a NodeFeatureDiscovery CR by using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) or the web console.

## Creating a NodeFeatureDiscovery CR by using the CLI

As a cluster administrator, you can create a NodeFeatureDiscovery CR instance by using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).


[NOTE]
----
The spec.operand.image setting requires a -rhel9 image to be defined for use with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform releases 4.13 and later.
----

The following example shows the use of -rhel9 to acquire the correct image.

* You have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You logged in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* You installed the the NFD Operator.

1. Create a NodeFeatureDiscovery CR:

## Creating a NodeFeatureDiscovery CR by using the CLI in a disconnected environment

As a cluster administrator, you can create a NodeFeatureDiscovery CR instance by using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You logged in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* You installed the the NFD Operator.
* You have access to a mirror registry with the required images.
* You installed the skopeo CLI tool.

1. Determine the digest of the registry image:
1. Run the following command:

```terminal
$ skopeo inspect docker://registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ose-node-feature-discovery:<openshift_version>
```

Example command

```terminal
$ skopeo inspect docker://registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ose-node-feature-discovery:v4.12
```

2. Inspect the output to identify the image digest:
Example output

```terminal
{
  ...
  "Digest": "sha256:1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef",
  ...
}
```

2. Use the skopeo CLI tool to copy the image from registry.redhat.io to your mirror registry, by running the following command:

```terminal
skopeo copy docker://registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ose-node-feature-discovery@<image_digest> docker://<mirror_registry>/openshift4/ose-node-feature-discovery@<image_digest>
```

Example command

```terminal
skopeo copy docker://registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ose-node-feature-discovery@sha256:1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef docker://<your-mirror-registry>/openshift4/ose-node-feature-discovery@sha256:1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
```

3. Create a NodeFeatureDiscovery CR:

```


## Creating a NodeFeatureDiscovery CR by using the web console

As a cluster administrator, you can create a NodeFeatureDiscovery CR by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

* You have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster
* You logged in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* You installed the the NFD Operator.

1. Navigate to the Operators -> Installed Operators page.
2. In the Node Feature Discovery section, under Provided APIs, click Create instance.
3. Edit the values of the NodeFeatureDiscovery CR.
4. Click Create.

# Configuring the Node Feature Discovery Operator

## core

The core section contains common configuration settings that are not specific to any particular feature source.

## core.sleepInterval

core.sleepInterval specifies the interval between consecutive passes of feature detection or re-detection, and thus also the interval between node re-labeling. A non-positive value implies infinite sleep interval; no re-detection or re-labeling is done.

This value is overridden by the deprecated --sleep-interval command line flag, if specified.


```yaml
core:
  sleepInterval: 60s 1
```


The default value is 60s.

## core.sources

core.sources specifies the list of enabled feature sources. A special value all enables all feature sources.

This value is overridden by the deprecated --sources command line flag, if specified.

Default: [all]


```yaml
core:
  sources:
    - system
    - custom
```


## core.labelWhiteList

core.labelWhiteList specifies a regular expression for filtering feature labels based on the label name. Non-matching labels are not published.

The regular expression is only matched against the basename part of the label, the part of the name after '/'. The label prefix,  or namespace, is omitted.

This value is overridden by the deprecated --label-whitelist command line flag, if specified.

Default: null


```yaml
core:
  labelWhiteList: '^cpu-cpuid'
```


## core.noPublish

Setting core.noPublish to true disables all communication with the nfd-master. It is effectively a dry run flag; nfd-worker runs feature detection normally, but no labeling requests are sent to nfd-master.

This value is overridden by the --no-publish command line flag, if specified.

Example:


```yaml
core:
  noPublish: true 1
```


The default value is false.

## core.klog

The following options specify the logger configuration, most of which can be dynamically adjusted at run-time.

The logger options can also be specified using command line flags, which take precedence over any corresponding config file options.

## core.klog.addDirHeader

If set to true, core.klog.addDirHeader adds the file directory to the header of the log messages.

Default: false

Run-time configurable: yes

## core.klog.alsologtostderr

Log to standard error as well as files.

Default: false

Run-time configurable: yes

## core.klog.logBacktraceAt

When logging hits line file:N, emit a stack trace.

Default: empty

Run-time configurable: yes

## core.klog.logDir

If non-empty, write log files in this directory.

Default: empty

Run-time configurable: no

## core.klog.logFile

If not empty, use this log file.

Default: empty

Run-time configurable: no

## core.klog.logFileMaxSize

core.klog.logFileMaxSize defines the maximum size a log file can grow to. Unit is megabytes. If the value is 0, the maximum file size is unlimited.

Default: 1800

Run-time configurable: no

## core.klog.logtostderr

Log to standard error instead of files

Default: true

Run-time configurable: yes

## core.klog.skipHeaders

If core.klog.skipHeaders is set to true, avoid header prefixes in the log messages.

Default: false

Run-time configurable: yes

## core.klog.skipLogHeaders

If core.klog.skipLogHeaders is set to true, avoid headers when opening log files.

Default: false

Run-time configurable: no

## core.klog.stderrthreshold

Logs at or above this threshold go to stderr.

Default: 2

Run-time configurable: yes

## core.klog.v

core.klog.v is the number for the log level verbosity.

Default: 0

Run-time configurable: yes

## core.klog.vmodule

core.klog.vmodule is a comma-separated list of pattern=N settings for file-filtered logging.

Default: empty

Run-time configurable: yes

## sources

The sources section contains feature source specific configuration parameters.

## sources.cpu.cpuid.attributeBlacklist

Prevent publishing cpuid features listed in this option.

This value is overridden by sources.cpu.cpuid.attributeWhitelist, if specified.

Default: [BMI1, BMI2, CLMUL, CMOV, CX16, ERMS, F16C, HTT, LZCNT, MMX, MMXEXT, NX, POPCNT, RDRAND, RDSEED, RDTSCP, SGX, SGXLC, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, SSSE3]


```yaml
sources:
  cpu:
    cpuid:
      attributeBlacklist: [MMX, MMXEXT]
```


## sources.cpu.cpuid.attributeWhitelist

Only publish the cpuid features listed in this option.

sources.cpu.cpuid.attributeWhitelist takes precedence over sources.cpu.cpuid.attributeBlacklist.

Default: empty


```yaml
sources:
  cpu:
    cpuid:
      attributeWhitelist: [AVX512BW, AVX512CD, AVX512DQ, AVX512F, AVX512VL]
```


## sources.kernel.kconfigFile

sources.kernel.kconfigFile is the path of the kernel config file. If empty, NFD runs a search in the well-known standard locations.

Default: empty


```yaml
sources:
  kernel:
    kconfigFile: "/path/to/kconfig"
```


## sources.kernel.configOpts

sources.kernel.configOpts represents kernel configuration options to publish as feature labels.

Default: [NO_HZ, NO_HZ_IDLE, NO_HZ_FULL, PREEMPT]


```yaml
sources:
  kernel:
    configOpts: [NO_HZ, X86, DMI]
```


## sources.pci.deviceClassWhitelist

sources.pci.deviceClassWhitelist is a list of PCI device class IDs for which to publish a label. It can be specified as a main class only (for example, 03) or full class-subclass combination (for example 0300). The former implies that all
subclasses are accepted.  The format of the labels can be further configured with deviceLabelFields.

Default: ["03", "0b40", "12"]


```yaml
sources:
  pci:
    deviceClassWhitelist: ["0200", "03"]
```


## sources.pci.deviceLabelFields

sources.pci.deviceLabelFields is the set of PCI ID fields to use when constructing the name of the feature label. Valid fields are class, vendor, device, subsystem_vendor and subsystem_device.

Default: [class, vendor]


```yaml
sources:
  pci:
    deviceLabelFields: [class, vendor, device]
```


With the example config above, NFD would publish labels such as feature.node.kubernetes.io/pci-<class-id><vendor-id><device-id>.present=true

## sources.usb.deviceClassWhitelist

sources.usb.deviceClassWhitelist is a list of USB device class IDs for
which to publish a feature label. The format of the labels can be further
configured with deviceLabelFields.

Default: ["0e", "ef", "fe", "ff"]


```yaml
sources:
  usb:
    deviceClassWhitelist: ["ef", "ff"]
```


## sources.usb.deviceLabelFields

sources.usb.deviceLabelFields is the set of USB ID fields from which to compose the name of the feature label. Valid fields are class, vendor, and device.

Default: [class, vendor, device]


```yaml
sources:
  pci:
    deviceLabelFields: [class, vendor]
```


With the example config above, NFD would publish labels like: feature.node.kubernetes.io/usb-<class-id>_<vendor-id>.present=true.

## sources.custom

sources.custom is the list of rules to process in the custom feature source to create user-specific labels.

Default: empty


```yaml
source:
  custom:
  - name: "my.custom.feature"
    matchOn:
    - loadedKMod: ["e1000e"]
    - pciId:
        class: ["0200"]
        vendor: ["8086"]
```


# About the NodeFeatureRule custom resource

NodeFeatureRule objects are a NodeFeatureDiscovery custom resource designed for rule-based custom labeling of nodes. Some use cases include application-specific labeling or distribution by hardware vendors to create specific labels for their devices.

NodeFeatureRule objects provide a method to create vendor- or application-specific labels and taints. It uses a flexible rule-based mechanism for creating labels and optionally taints based on node features.

# Using the NodeFeatureRule custom resource

Create a NodeFeatureRule object to label nodes if a set of rules match the conditions.

1. Create a custom resource file named nodefeaturerule.yaml that contains the following text:

```yaml
apiVersion: nfd.openshift.io/v1
kind: NodeFeatureRule
metadata:
  name: example-rule
spec:
  rules:
    - name: "example rule"
      labels:
        "example-custom-feature": "true"
      # Label is created if all of the rules below match
      matchFeatures:
        # Match if "veth" kernel module is loaded
        - feature: kernel.loadedmodule
          matchExpressions:
            veth: {op: Exists}
        # Match if any PCI device with vendor 8086 exists in the system
        - feature: pci.device
          matchExpressions:
            vendor: {op: In, value: ["8086"]}
```


This custom resource specifies that labelling occurs when the veth module is loaded and any PCI device with vendor code 8086 exists in the cluster.
2. Apply the nodefeaturerule.yaml file to your cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-feature-discovery/v0.13.6/examples/nodefeaturerule.yaml
```


The example applies the feature label on nodes with the veth module loaded and any PCI device with vendor code 8086 exists.

[NOTE]
----
A relabeling delay of up to 1 minute might occur.

The Node Feature Discovery (NFD) Topology Updater is a daemon responsible for examining allocated resources on a worker node. It accounts for resources that are available to be allocated to new pod on a per-zone basis, where a zone can be a Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) node. The NFD Topology Updater communicates the information to nfd-master, which creates a NodeResourceTopology custom resource (CR) corresponding to all of the worker nodes in the cluster. One instance of the NFD Topology Updater runs on each node of the cluster.

To enable the Topology Updater workers in NFD, set the topologyupdater variable to true in the NodeFeatureDiscovery CR, as described in the section Using the Node Feature Discovery Operator.

## NodeResourceTopology CR

When run with NFD Topology Updater, NFD creates custom resource instances corresponding to the node resource hardware topology, such as:


```yaml
apiVersion: topology.node.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: NodeResourceTopology
metadata:
  name: node1
topologyPolicies: ["SingleNUMANodeContainerLevel"]
zones:
  - name: node-0
    type: Node
    resources:
      - name: cpu
        capacity: 20
        allocatable: 16
        available: 10
      - name: vendor/nic1
        capacity: 3
        allocatable: 3
        available: 3
  - name: node-1
    type: Node
    resources:
      - name: cpu
        capacity: 30
        allocatable: 30
        available: 15
      - name: vendor/nic2
        capacity: 6
        allocatable: 6
        available: 6
  - name: node-2
    type: Node
    resources:
      - name: cpu
        capacity: 30
        allocatable: 30
        available: 15
      - name: vendor/nic1
        capacity: 3
        allocatable: 3
        available: 3
```


## NFD Topology Updater command line flags

To view available command line flags, run the nfd-topology-updater -help command. For example, in a podman container, run the following command:


```terminal
$ podman run gcr.io/k8s-staging-nfd/node-feature-discovery:master nfd-topology-updater -help
```


## -ca-file

The -ca-file flag is one of the three flags, together with the -cert-file and `-key-file`flags, that controls the mutual TLS authentication on the NFD Topology Updater. This flag specifies the TLS root certificate that is used for verifying the authenticity of nfd-master.

Default: empty


[IMPORTANT]
----
The -ca-file flag must be specified together with the -cert-file and -key-file flags.
----


```terminal
$ nfd-topology-updater -ca-file=/opt/nfd/ca.crt -cert-file=/opt/nfd/updater.crt -key-file=/opt/nfd/updater.key
```


## -cert-file

The -cert-file flag is one of the three flags, together with the -ca-file and -key-file flags, that controls mutual TLS authentication on the NFD Topology Updater. This flag specifies the TLS certificate presented for authenticating outgoing requests.

Default: empty


[IMPORTANT]
----
The -cert-file flag must be specified together with the -ca-file and -key-file flags.
----


```terminal
$ nfd-topology-updater -cert-file=/opt/nfd/updater.crt -key-file=/opt/nfd/updater.key -ca-file=/opt/nfd/ca.crt
```


## -h, -help

Print usage and exit.

## -key-file

The -key-file flag is one of the three flags, together with the -ca-file and -cert-file flags, that controls the mutual TLS authentication on the NFD Topology Updater. This flag specifies the private key corresponding the given certificate file, or -cert-file, that is used for authenticating outgoing requests.

Default: empty


[IMPORTANT]
----
The -key-file flag must be specified together with the -ca-file and -cert-file flags.
----


```terminal
$ nfd-topology-updater -key-file=/opt/nfd/updater.key -cert-file=/opt/nfd/updater.crt -ca-file=/opt/nfd/ca.crt
```


## -kubelet-config-file

The -kubelet-config-file specifies the path to the Kubelet&#8217;s configuration
file.

Default: /host-var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml


```terminal
$ nfd-topology-updater -kubelet-config-file=/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml
```


## -no-publish

The -no-publish flag disables all communication with the nfd-master, making it a dry run flag for nfd-topology-updater. NFD Topology Updater runs resource hardware topology detection normally, but no CR requests are sent to nfd-master.

Default: false


```terminal
$ nfd-topology-updater -no-publish
```


### -oneshot

The -oneshot flag causes the NFD Topology Updater to exit after one pass of resource hardware topology detection.

Default: false


```terminal
$ nfd-topology-updater -oneshot -no-publish
```


## -podresources-socket

The -podresources-socket flag specifies the path to the Unix socket where kubelet exports a gRPC service to enable discovery of in-use CPUs and devices, and to provide metadata for them.

Default: /host-var/liblib/kubelet/pod-resources/kubelet.sock


```terminal
$ nfd-topology-updater -podresources-socket=/var/lib/kubelet/pod-resources/kubelet.sock
```


## -server

The -server flag specifies the address of the nfd-master endpoint to connect to.

Default: localhost:8080


```terminal
$ nfd-topology-updater -server=nfd-master.nfd.svc.cluster.local:443
```


## -server-name-override

The -server-name-override flag specifies the common name (CN) which to expect from the nfd-master TLS certificate. This flag is mostly intended for development and debugging purposes.

Default: empty


```terminal
$ nfd-topology-updater -server-name-override=localhost
```


## -sleep-interval

The -sleep-interval flag specifies the interval between resource hardware topology re-examination and custom resource updates. A non-positive value implies infinite sleep interval and no re-detection is done.

Default: 60s


```terminal
$ nfd-topology-updater -sleep-interval=1h
```


## -version

Print version and exit.

## -watch-namespace

The -watch-namespace flag specifies the namespace to ensure that resource hardware topology examination only happens for the pods running in the
specified namespace. Pods that are not running in the specified namespace are not considered during resource accounting. This is particularly useful for testing and debugging purposes. A * value means that all of the pods across all namespaces are considered during the accounting process.

Default: *


```terminal
$ nfd-topology-updater -watch-namespace=rte
```
