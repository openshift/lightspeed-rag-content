# Kernel Module Management Operator release notes



# Release notes for Kernel Module Management Operator 2.2

## New features

* KMM is now using the CRI-O container engine to pull container images in the worker pod instead of using HTTP calls directly from the worker container. For more information, see Example Module CR.

* The Kernel Module Management (KMM) Operator images are now based on rhel-els-minimal container images instead of the rhel-els images. This change results in a greatly reduced image footprint, while still maintaining FIPS compliance.

* In this release, the firmware search path has been updated to copy the contents of the specified path into the path specified in worker.setFirmwareClassPath (default: /var/lib/firmware). For more information, see Example Module CR.

* For each node running a kernel matching the regular expression, KMM now checks if you have included a tag or a digest. If you have not specified a tag or digest in the container image, then the validation webhook returns an error and does not apply the module. For more information, see Example Module CR.
