# Checking the control plane machine set custom resource state

You can verify the existence and state of the ControlPlaneMachineSet custom resource (CR).

* Determine the state of the CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get controlplanemachineset.machine.openshift.io cluster \
  --namespace openshift-machine-api
```

* A result of Active indicates that the ControlPlaneMachineSet CR exists and is activated. No administrator action is required.
* A result of Inactive indicates that a ControlPlaneMachineSet CR exists but is not activated.
* A result of NotFound indicates that there is no existing ControlPlaneMachineSet CR.

To use the control plane machine set, you must ensure that a ControlPlaneMachineSet CR with the correct settings for your cluster exists.

* If your cluster has an existing CR, you must verify that the configuration in the CR is correct for your cluster.
* If your cluster does not have an existing CR, you must create one with the correct configuration for your cluster.

# Adding a missing Azure internal load balancer

The internalLoadBalancer parameter is required in both the ControlPlaneMachineSet and control plane Machine custom resources (CRs) for Azure. If this parameter is not preconfigured on your cluster, you must add it to both CRs.

For more information about where this parameter is located in the Azure provider specification, see the sample Azure provider specification. The placement in the control plane Machine CR is similar.

1. List the control plane machines in your cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get machines \
  -l machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machine-role==master \
  -n openshift-machine-api
```

2. For each control plane machine, edit the CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc edit machine <control_plane_machine_name>
```

3. Add the internalLoadBalancer parameter with the correct details for your cluster and save your changes.
4. Edit your control plane machine set CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc edit controlplanemachineset.machine.openshift.io cluster \
  -n openshift-machine-api
```

5. Add the internalLoadBalancer parameter with the correct details for your cluster and save your changes.

* For clusters that use the default RollingUpdate update strategy, the Operator automatically propagates the changes to your control plane configuration.
* For clusters that are configured to use the OnDelete update strategy, you must replace your control plane machines manually.

* Sample Microsoft Azure provider specification

# Recovering a degraded etcd Operator

Certain situations can cause the etcd Operator to become degraded.

For example, while performing remediation, the machine health check might delete a control plane machine that is hosting etcd. If the etcd member is not reachable at that time, the etcd Operator becomes degraded.

When the etcd Operator is degraded, manual intervention is required to force the Operator to remove the failed member and restore the cluster state.

1. List the control plane machines in your cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get machines \
  -l machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machine-role==master \
  -n openshift-machine-api \
  -o wide
```


Any of the following conditions might indicate a failed control plane machine:
* The STATE value is stopped.
* The PHASE value is Failed.
* The PHASE value is Deleting for more than ten minutes.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Before continuing, ensure that your cluster has two healthy control plane machines. Performing the actions in this procedure on more than one control plane machine risks losing etcd quorum and can cause data loss.
If you have lost the majority of your control plane hosts, leading to etcd quorum loss, then you must follow the disaster recovery procedure "Restoring to a previous cluster state" instead of this procedure.
----
2. Edit the machine CR for the failed control plane machine by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc edit machine <control_plane_machine_name>
```

3. Remove the contents of the lifecycleHooks parameter from the failed control plane machine and save your changes.

The etcd Operator removes the failed machine from the cluster and can then safely add new etcd members.

# Upgrading clusters that run on RHOSP

For clusters that run on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) that were created with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.13 or earlier, you might have to perform post-upgrade tasks before you can use control plane machine sets.

## Configuring RHOSP clusters that have machines with root volume availability zones after an upgrade

For some clusters that run on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) that you upgrade, you must manually update machine resources before you can use control plane machine sets if the following configurations are true:

* The upgraded cluster was created with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.13 or earlier.
* The cluster infrastructure is installer-provisioned.
* Machines were distributed across multiple availability zones.
* Machines were configured to use root volumes for which block storage availability zones were not defined.

To understand why this procedure is necessary, see Solution #7024383.

1. For all control plane machines, edit the provider spec for all control plane machines that match the environment. For example, to edit the machine master-0, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc edit machine/<cluster_id>-master-0 -n openshift-machine-api
```


where:
<cluster_id>:: Specifies the ID of the upgraded cluster.
2. In the provider spec, set the value of the property rootVolume.availabilityZone to the volume of the availability zone you want to use.
An example RHOSP provider spec

```yaml
providerSpec:
  value:
    apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1alpha1
    availabilityZone: az0
      cloudName: openstack
    cloudsSecret:
      name: openstack-cloud-credentials
      namespace: openshift-machine-api
    flavor: m1.xlarge
    image: rhcos-4.14
    kind: OpenstackProviderSpec
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
    networks:
    - filter: {}
      subnets:
      - filter:
          name: refarch-lv7q9-nodes
          tags: openshiftClusterID=refarch-lv7q9
    rootVolume:
        availabilityZone: nova 1
        diskSize: 30
        sourceUUID: rhcos-4.12
        volumeType: fast-0
    securityGroups:
    - filter: {}
      name: refarch-lv7q9-master
    serverGroupName: refarch-lv7q9-master
    serverMetadata:
      Name: refarch-lv7q9-master
      openshiftClusterID: refarch-lv7q9
    tags:
    - openshiftClusterID=refarch-lv7q9
    trunk: true
    userDataSecret:
      name: master-user-data
```

Set the zone name as this value.

[NOTE]
----
If you edited or recreated machine resources after your initial cluster deployment, you might have to adapt these steps for your configuration.
In your RHOSP cluster, find the availability zone of the root volumes for your machines and use that as the value.
----
3. Run the following command to retrieve information about the control plane machine set resource:

```terminal
$ oc describe controlplanemachineset.machine.openshift.io/cluster --namespace openshift-machine-api
```

4. Run the following command to edit the resource:

```terminal
$ oc edit controlplanemachineset.machine.openshift.io/cluster --namespace openshift-machine-api
```

5. For that resource, set the value of the spec.state property to Active to activate control plane machine sets for your cluster.

Your control plane is ready to be managed by the Cluster Control Plane Machine Set Operator.

## Configuring RHOSP clusters that have control plane machines with availability zones after an upgrade

For some clusters that run on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) that you upgrade, you must manually update machine resources before you can use control plane machine sets if the following configurations are true:

* The upgraded cluster was created with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.13 or earlier.
* The cluster infrastructure is installer-provisioned.
* Control plane machines were distributed across multiple compute availability zones.

To understand why this procedure is necessary, see Solution #7013893.

1. For the master-1 and master-2 control plane machines, open the provider specs for editing. For example, to edit the first machine, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc edit machine/<cluster_id>-master-1 -n openshift-machine-api
```


where:
<cluster_id>:: Specifies the ID of the upgraded cluster.
2. For the master-1 and master-2 control plane machines, edit the value of the serverGroupName property in their provider specs to match that of the machine master-0.
An example RHOSP provider spec

```yaml
providerSpec:
  value:
    apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1alpha1
    availabilityZone: az0
      cloudName: openstack
    cloudsSecret:
      name: openstack-cloud-credentials
      namespace: openshift-machine-api
    flavor: m1.xlarge
    image: rhcos-4.17
    kind: OpenstackProviderSpec
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
    networks:
    - filter: {}
      subnets:
      - filter:
          name: refarch-lv7q9-nodes
          tags: openshiftClusterID=refarch-lv7q9
    securityGroups:
    - filter: {}
      name: refarch-lv7q9-master
    serverGroupName: refarch-lv7q9-master-az0 1
    serverMetadata:
      Name: refarch-lv7q9-master
      openshiftClusterID: refarch-lv7q9
    tags:
    - openshiftClusterID=refarch-lv7q9
    trunk: true
    userDataSecret:
      name: master-user-data
```

This value must match for machines master-0, master-1, and master-3.

[NOTE]
----
If you edited or recreated machine resources after your initial cluster deployment, you might have to adapt these steps for your configuration.
In your RHOSP cluster, find the server group that your control plane instances are in and use that as the value.
----
3. Run the following command to retrieve information about the control plane machine set resource:

```terminal
$ oc describe controlplanemachineset.machine.openshift.io/cluster --namespace openshift-machine-api
```

4. Run the following command to edit the resource:

```terminal
$ oc edit controlplanemachineset.machine.openshift.io/cluster --namespace openshift-machine-api
```

5. For that resource, set the value of the spec.state property to Active to activate control plane machine sets for your cluster.

Your control plane is ready to be managed by the Cluster Control Plane Machine Set Operator.
