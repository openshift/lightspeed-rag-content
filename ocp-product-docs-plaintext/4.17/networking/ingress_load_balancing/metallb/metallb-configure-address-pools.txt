# Configuring MetalLB address pools


To allocate and manage the IP addresses assigned to load balancer services, configure MetalLB address pool custom resources. Defining these pools ensures that application workloads remain reachable through designated network ranges for consistent external access.
The namespaces used in the examples show metallb-system as the namespace.
For more information about how to install the MetalLB Operator, see About MetalLB and the MetalLB Operator.

# About the IPAddressPool custom resource

To define the IP address ranges available for load balancer services, configure the properties of the MetalLB IPAddressPool custom resource (CR). Establishing these parameters allows your cluster to automatically allocate specific external addresses to your application workloads.

The following table details the parameters for the IPAddressPool CR:



You can assign IP addresses from an IPAddressPool to services and namespaces by configuring the spec.serviceAllocation specification.



# Configuring an address pool

To precisely manage external access to application workloads, configure MetalLB address pools for your cluster. By defining these pools, you can control the specific IP address ranges assigned to load balancer services for consistent network routing.

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

1. Create a file, such as ipaddresspool.yaml, with content like the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  namespace: metallb-system
  name: doc-example
  labels:
    zone: east
spec:
  addresses:
  - 203.0.113.1-203.0.113.10
  - 203.0.113.65-203.0.113.75
# ...
```


where:
labels:: The label assigned to the IPAddressPool can be referenced by the ipAddressPoolSelectors in the BGPAdvertisement CRD to associate the IPAddressPool with the advertisement.
2. Apply the configuration for the IP address pool by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f ipaddresspool.yaml
```


1. View the address pool by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc describe -n metallb-system IPAddressPool doc-example
```

Example output

```terminal
Name:         doc-example
Namespace:    metallb-system
Labels:       zone=east
Annotations:  <none>
API Version:  metallb.io/v1beta1
Kind:         IPAddressPool
Metadata:
  ...
Spec:
  Addresses:
    203.0.113.1-203.0.113.10
    203.0.113.65-203.0.113.75
  Auto Assign:  true
Events:         <none>
```

2. Confirm that the address pool name, such as doc-example, and the IP address ranges exist in the output.

# Configure MetalLB address pool for VLAN

To precisely manage external access across a specific VLAN, configure MetalLB address pools for your cluster. Defining these pools ensures that load balancer services receive authorized IP addresses from designated network ranges for secure and consistent routing.

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Configure a separate VLAN.
* Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

1. Create a file, such as ipaddresspool-vlan.yaml, that is similar to the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  namespace: metallb-system
  name: doc-example-vlan
  labels:
    zone: east
spec:
  addresses:
  - 192.168.100.1-192.168.100.254
# ...
```


where:
labels.zone:: This label assigned to the IPAddressPool can be referenced by the ipAddressPoolSelectors in the BGPAdvertisement CRD to associate the IPAddressPool with the advertisement.
spec.addresses:: This IP range must match the subnet assigned to the VLAN on your network. To support layer 2 (L2) mode, the IP address range must be within the same subnet as the cluster nodes.
2. Apply the configuration for the IP address pool:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f ipaddresspool-vlan.yaml
```

3. To ensure this configuration applies to the VLAN, you need to set the spec gatewayConfig.ipForwarding to Global.
1. Run the following command to edit the network configuration custom resource (CR):

```terminal
$ oc edit network.operator.openshift/cluster
```

2. Update the spec.defaultNetwork.ovnKubernetesConfig section to include the gatewayConfig.ipForwarding set to Global. The following example demonstrates this configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  clusterNetwork:
    - cidr: 10.128.0.0/14
      hostPrefix: 23
  defaultNetwork:
    type: OVNKubernetes
    ovnKubernetesConfig:
      gatewayConfig:
        ipForwarding: Global
# ...
```


# Example address pool configurations

To precisely allocate IP address ranges for cluster services, configure MetalLB address pools by using Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation or hyphenated bounds. Defining these specific ranges ensures that application workloads receive valid IP assignments that align with your existing network infrastructure requirements.

Example of IPv4 and CIDR ranges:: You can specify a range of IP addresses in classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) notation. You can combine CIDR notation with the notation that uses a hyphen to separate lower and upper bounds.


```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  name: doc-example-cidr
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
  - 192.168.100.0/24
  - 192.168.200.0/24
  - 192.168.255.1-192.168.255.5
# ...
```


Example of assigning IP addresses:: You can set the autoAssign parameter to false to prevent MetalLB from automatically assigning IP addresses from the address pool. You can then assign a single IP address or multiple IP addresses from an IP address pool. To assign an IP address, append the /32 CIDR notation to the target IP address in the spec.addresses parameter. This setting ensures that only the specific IP address is available for assignment, leaving non-reserved IP addresses for application use.


```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  name: doc-example-reserved
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
  - 192.168.100.1/32
  - 192.168.200.1/32
  autoAssign: false
# ...
```



[NOTE]
----
When you add a service, you can request a specific IP address from the address pool or you can specify the pool name in an annotation to request any IP address from the pool.
----

Example of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses:: You can add address pools that use IPv4 and IPv6. You can specify multiple ranges in the addresses list, just like several IPv4 examples.

How the service is assigned to a single IPv4 address, a single IPv6 address, or both is determined by how you add the service. The spec.ipFamilies and spec.ipFamilyPolicy parameters control how IP addresses are assigned to the service.


```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  name: doc-example-combined
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
  - 10.0.100.0/28 1
  - 2002:2:2::1-2002:2:2::100
# ...
```


spec.addresses: Where 10.0.100.0/28 is the local network IP address followed by the /28 network prefix.

Example of assigning IP address pools to services or namespaces:: You can assign IP addresses from an IPAddressPool to services and namespaces that you specify.

If you assign a service or namespace to more than one IP address pool, MetalLB uses an available IP address from the higher-priority IP address pool. If no IP addresses are available from the assigned IP address pools with a high priority, MetalLB uses available IP addresses from an IP address pool with lower priority or no priority.


[NOTE]
----
You can use the matchLabels label selector, the matchExpressions label selector, or both, for the namespaceSelectors and serviceSelectors specifications. This example demonstrates one label selector for each specification.
----


```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  name: doc-example-service-allocation
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
    - 192.168.20.0/24
  serviceAllocation:
    priority: 50
    namespaces:
      - namespace-a
      - namespace-b
    namespaceSelectors:
      - matchLabels:
          zone: east
    serviceSelectors:
      - matchExpressions:
        - key: security
          operator: In
          values:
          - S1
# ...
```


where:

serviceAllocation.priority:: Assign a priority to the address pool. A lower number indicates a higher priority.
serviceAllocation.namespaces:: Assign one or more namespaces to the IP address pool in a list format.
serviceAllocation.namespaceSelectors:: Assign one or more namespace labels to the IP address pool by using label selectors in a list format.
serviceAllocation.serviceSelectors:: Assign one or more service labels to the IP address pool by using label selectors in a list format.
