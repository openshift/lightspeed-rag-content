# Configuring multitenant isolation with network policy


As a cluster administrator, you can configure your network policies to provide multitenant network isolation.

[NOTE]
----
Configuring network policies as described in this section provides network isolation similar to the multitenant mode of OpenShift SDN in previous versions of {product-name}.
----

# Configuring multitenant isolation by using network policy

You can configure your project to isolate it from pods and services in other
project namespaces.

* Your cluster uses a network plugin that supports NetworkPolicy objects, such as the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin or the OpenShift SDN network plugin with mode: NetworkPolicy set. This mode is the default for OpenShift SDN.
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You are logged in to the cluster with a user with admin privileges.

1. Create the following NetworkPolicy objects:
1. A policy named allow-from-openshift-ingress.

```terminal
$ cat << EOF| oc create -f -
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-from-openshift-ingress
spec:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          policy-group.network.openshift.io/ingress: ""
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
EOF
```


[NOTE]
----
policy-group.network.openshift.io/ingress: "" is the preferred namespace selector label for OpenShift SDN. You can use the network.openshift.io/policy-group: ingress namespace selector label, but this is a legacy label.
----
2. A policy named allow-from-openshift-monitoring:

```terminal
$ cat << EOF| oc create -f -
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-from-openshift-monitoring
spec:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          network.openshift.io/policy-group: monitoring
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
EOF
```

3. A policy named allow-same-namespace:

```terminal
$ cat << EOF| oc create -f -
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-same-namespace
spec:
  podSelector:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector: {}
EOF
```

4. A policy named allow-from-kube-apiserver-operator:

```terminal
$ cat << EOF| oc create -f -
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-from-kube-apiserver-operator
spec:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          kubernetes.io/metadata.name: openshift-kube-apiserver-operator
      podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: kube-apiserver-operator
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
EOF
```

2. Optional: To confirm that the network policies exist in your current project, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc describe networkpolicy
```
