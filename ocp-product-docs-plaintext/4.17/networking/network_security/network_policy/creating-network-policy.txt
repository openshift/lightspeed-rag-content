# Creating a network policy


As a user with the admin role, you can create a network policy for a namespace.

# Example NetworkPolicy object

The following annotates an example NetworkPolicy object:


```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-27107 1
spec:
  podSelector: 2
    matchLabels:
      app: mongodb
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector: 3
        matchLabels:
          app: app
    ports: 4
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 27017
```


The name of the NetworkPolicy object.
A selector that describes the pods to which the policy applies.
The policy object can only select pods in the project that defines the NetworkPolicy object.
A selector that matches the pods from which the policy object allows ingress traffic. The selector matches pods in the same namespace as the NetworkPolicy.
A list of one or more destination ports on which to accept traffic.

# Creating a network policy using the CLI

To define granular rules describing ingress or egress network traffic allowed for namespaces in your cluster, you can create a {name} policy.


[NOTE]
----
If you log in with a user with the cluster-admin role, then you can create a network policy in any namespace in the cluster.
----

* Your cluster uses a network plugin that supports NetworkPolicy objects, such as the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, with mode: NetworkPolicy set.
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You are logged in to the cluster with a user with {role} privileges.
* You are working in the namespace that the {name} policy applies to.

1. Create a policy rule:
1. Create a <policy_name>.yaml file:

```terminal
$ touch <policy_name>.yaml
```

where:
<policy_name>:: Specifies the {name} policy file name.
2. Define a {name} policy in the file that you just created, such as in the following examples:
Deny ingress from all pods in all namespaces

This is a fundamental policy, blocking all cross-pod networking other than cross-pod traffic allowed by the configuration of other Network Policies.

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: deny-by-default
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress: []
```

Allow ingress from all pods in the same namespace

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-same-namespace
spec:
  podSelector:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector: {}
```

Allow ingress traffic to one pod from a particular namespace

This policy allows traffic to pods labelled pod-a from pods running in namespace-y.

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-traffic-pod
spec:
  podSelector:
   matchLabels:
      pod: pod-a
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
           kubernetes.io/metadata.name: namespace-y
```

2. To create the {name} policy object, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <policy_name>.yaml -n <namespace>
```

where:
<policy_name>:: Specifies the {name} policy file name.
<namespace>:: Optional: Specifies the namespace if the object is defined in a different namespace than the current namespace.
Example output

```terminal
networkpolicy.networking.k8s.io/deny-by-default created
```



[NOTE]
----
If you log in to the web console with cluster-admin privileges, you have a choice of creating a network policy in any namespace in the cluster directly in YAML or from a form in the web console.
----

# Creating a default deny all network policy

This policy blocks all cross-pod networking other than network traffic allowed by the configuration of other deployed network policies and traffic between host-networked pods. This procedure enforces a strong deny policy by applying a deny-by-default policy in the my-project namespace.


[WARNING]
----
Without configuring a NetworkPolicy custom resource (CR) that allows traffic communication, the following policy might cause communication problems across your cluster.
----

* Your cluster uses a network plugin that supports NetworkPolicy objects, such as the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, with mode: NetworkPolicy set.
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You are logged in to the cluster with a user with {role} privileges.
* You are working in the namespace that the {name} policy applies to.

1. Create the following YAML that defines a deny-by-default policy to deny ingress from all pods in all namespaces. Save the YAML in the deny-by-default.yaml file:

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: deny-by-default
  namespace: my-project 1
spec:
  podSelector: {} 2
  ingress: [] 3
```

Specifies the namespace in which to deploy the policy. For example, the `my-project namespace.
If this field is empty, the configuration matches all the pods. Therefore, the policy applies to all pods in the my-project namespace.
There are no ingress rules specified. This causes incoming traffic to be dropped to all pods.
2. Apply the policy by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f deny-by-default.yaml
```

Example output

```terminal
networkpolicy.networking.k8s.io/deny-by-default created
```


# Creating a network policy to allow traffic from external clients

With the deny-by-default policy in place you can proceed to configure a policy that allows traffic from external clients to a pod with the label app=web.


[NOTE]
----
If you log in with a user with the cluster-admin role, then you can create a network policy in any namespace in the cluster.
----

Follow this procedure to configure a policy that allows external service from the public Internet directly or by using a Load Balancer to access the pod. Traffic is only allowed to a pod with the label app=web.

* Your cluster uses a network plugin that supports NetworkPolicy objects, such as the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, with mode: NetworkPolicy set.
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You are logged in to the cluster with a user with {role} privileges.
* You are working in the namespace that the {name} policy applies to.

1. Create a policy that allows traffic from the public Internet directly or by using a load balancer to access the pod. Save the YAML in the web-allow-external.yaml file:

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: web-allow-external
  namespace: default
spec:
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web
  ingress:
    - {}
```

2. Apply the policy by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f web-allow-external.yaml
```

Example output

```terminal
networkpolicy.networking.k8s.io/web-allow-external created
```


This policy allows traffic from all resources, including external traffic as illustrated in the following diagram:

![Allow traffic from external clients]

# Creating a network policy allowing traffic to an application from all namespaces


[NOTE]
----
If you log in with a user with the cluster-admin role, then you can create a network policy in any namespace in the cluster.
----

Follow this procedure to configure a policy that allows traffic from all pods in all namespaces to a particular application.

* Your cluster uses a network plugin that supports NetworkPolicy objects, such as the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, with mode: NetworkPolicy set.
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You are logged in to the cluster with a user with {role} privileges.
* You are working in the namespace that the {name} policy applies to.

1. Create a policy that allows traffic from all pods in all namespaces to a particular application. Save the YAML in the web-allow-all-namespaces.yaml file:

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: web-allow-all-namespaces
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web 1
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector: {} 2
```

Applies the policy only to app:web pods in default namespace.
Selects all pods in all namespaces.

[NOTE]
----
By default, if you omit specifying a namespaceSelector it does not select any namespaces, which means the policy allows traffic only from the namespace the network policy is deployed to.
----
2. Apply the policy by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f web-allow-all-namespaces.yaml
```

Example output

```terminal
networkpolicy.networking.k8s.io/web-allow-all-namespaces created
```


1. Start a web service in the default namespace by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc run web --namespace=default --image=nginx --labels="app=web" --expose --port=80
```

2. Run the following command to deploy an alpine image in the secondary namespace and to start a shell:

```terminal
$ oc run test-$RANDOM --namespace=secondary --rm -i -t --image=alpine -- sh
```

3. Run the following command in the shell and observe that the request is allowed:

```terminal
# wget -qO- --timeout=2 http://web.default
```

Expected output

```terminal

# Creating a network policy allowing traffic to an application from a namespace


[NOTE]
----
If you log in with a user with the cluster-admin role, then you can create a network policy in any namespace in the cluster.
----

Follow this procedure to configure a policy that allows traffic to a pod with the label app=web from a particular namespace. You might want to do this to:

* Restrict traffic to a production database only to namespaces where production workloads are deployed.
* Enable monitoring tools deployed to a particular namespace to scrape metrics from the current namespace.

* Your cluster uses a network plugin that supports NetworkPolicy objects, such as the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, with mode: NetworkPolicy set.
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You are logged in to the cluster with a user with {role} privileges.
* You are working in the namespace that the {name} policy applies to.

1. Create a policy that allows traffic from all pods in a particular namespaces with a label purpose=production. Save the YAML in the web-allow-prod.yaml file:

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: web-allow-prod
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web 1
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          purpose: production 2
```

Applies the policy only to app:web pods in the default namespace.
Restricts traffic to only pods in namespaces that have the label purpose=production.
2. Apply the policy by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f web-allow-prod.yaml
```

Example output

```terminal
networkpolicy.networking.k8s.io/web-allow-prod created
```


1. Start a web service in the default namespace by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc run web --namespace=default --image=nginx --labels="app=web" --expose --port=80
```

2. Run the following command to create the prod namespace:

```terminal
$ oc create namespace prod
```

3. Run the following command to label the prod namespace:

```terminal
$ oc label namespace/prod purpose=production
```

4. Run the following command to create the dev namespace:

```terminal
$ oc create namespace dev
```

5. Run the following command to label the dev namespace:

```terminal
$ oc label namespace/dev purpose=testing
```

6. Run the following command to deploy an alpine image in the dev namespace and to start a shell:

```terminal
$ oc run test-$RANDOM --namespace=dev --rm -i -t --image=alpine -- sh
```

7. Run the following command in the shell and observe that the request is blocked:

```terminal
# wget -qO- --timeout=2 http://web.default
```

Expected output

```terminal
wget: download timed out
```

8. Run the following command to deploy an alpine image in the prod namespace and start a shell:

```terminal
$ oc run test-$RANDOM --namespace=prod --rm -i -t --image=alpine -- sh
```

9. Run the following command in the shell and observe that the request is allowed:

```terminal
# wget -qO- --timeout=2 http://web.default
```

Expected output

```terminal
