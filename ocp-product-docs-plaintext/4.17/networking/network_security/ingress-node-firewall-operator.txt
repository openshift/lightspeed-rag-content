# Ingress Node Firewall Operator in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform


The Ingress Node Firewall Operator allows administrators to manage firewall configurations at the node level.

# Ingress Node Firewall Operator

The Ingress Node Firewall Operator provides ingress firewall rules at a node level by deploying the daemon set to nodes you specify and manage in the firewall configurations. To deploy the daemon set, you create an IngressNodeFirewallConfig custom resource (CR). The Operator applies the IngressNodeFirewallConfig CR to create ingress node firewall daemon set daemon, which run on all nodes that match the nodeSelector.

You configure rules of the IngressNodeFirewall CR and apply them to clusters using the nodeSelector and setting values to "true".


[IMPORTANT]
----
The Ingress Node Firewall Operator supports only stateless firewall rules.
Network interface controllers (NICs) that do not support native XDP drivers will run at a lower performance.
For Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14 or later, you must run Ingress Node Firewall Operator on RHEL 9.0 or later.

## Installing the Ingress Node Firewall Operator using the web console

As a cluster administrator, you can install the Operator using the web console.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have an account with administrator privileges.

1. Install the Ingress Node Firewall Operator:
1. In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, click Operators -> OperatorHub.
2. Select Ingress Node Firewall Operator from the list of available Operators, and then click Install.
3. On the Install Operator page, under Installed Namespace, select Operator recommended Namespace.
4. Click Install.
2. Verify that the Ingress Node Firewall Operator is installed successfully:
1. Navigate to the Operators -> Installed Operators page.
2. Ensure that Ingress Node Firewall Operator is listed in the openshift-ingress-node-firewall project with a Status of InstallSucceeded.

[NOTE]
----
During installation an Operator might display a Failed status.
If the installation later succeeds with an InstallSucceeded message, you can ignore the Failed message.
----

If the Operator does not have a Status of InstallSucceeded, troubleshoot using the following steps:
* Inspect the Operator Subscriptions and Install Plans tabs for any failures or errors under Status.
* Navigate to the Workloads -> Pods page and check the logs for pods in the openshift-ingress-node-firewall project.
* Check the namespace of the YAML file. If the annotation is missing, you can add the annotation workload.openshift.io/allowed=management to the Operator namespace with the following command:

```terminal
$ oc annotate ns/openshift-ingress-node-firewall workload.openshift.io/allowed=management
```


[NOTE]
----
For single-node OpenShift clusters, the openshift-ingress-node-firewall namespace requires the workload.openshift.io/allowed=management annotation.

# Deploying Ingress Node Firewall Operator

* The Ingress Node Firewall Operator is installed.

To deploy the Ingress Node Firewall Operator, create a IngressNodeFirewallConfig custom resource that will deploy the Operator&#8217;s daemon set. You can deploy one or multiple IngressNodeFirewall CRDs to nodes by applying firewall rules.

1. Create the IngressNodeFirewallConfig inside the openshift-ingress-node-firewall namespace named ingressnodefirewallconfig.
2. Run the following command to deploy Ingress Node Firewall Operator rules:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f rule.yaml
```


## Ingress Node Firewall configuration object

The fields for the Ingress Node Firewall configuration object are described in the following table:




[NOTE]
----
The Operator consumes the CR and creates an ingress node firewall daemon set on all the nodes that match the nodeSelector.
----

## Ingress Node Firewall Operator example configuration

A complete Ingress Node Firewall Configuration is specified in the following example:


```yaml
apiVersion: ingressnodefirewall.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: IngressNodeFirewallConfig
metadata:
  name: ingressnodefirewallconfig
  namespace: openshift-ingress-node-firewall
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ""
```



[NOTE]
----
The Operator consumes the CR and creates an ingress node firewall daemon set on all the nodes that match the nodeSelector.
----

## Ingress Node Firewall rules object

The fields for the Ingress Node Firewall rules object are described in the following table:



## Ingress object configuration

The values for the ingress object are defined in the following table:



## Ingress Node Firewall rules object example

A complete Ingress Node Firewall configuration is specified in the following example:


```yaml
apiVersion: ingressnodefirewall.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: IngressNodeFirewall
metadata:
  name: ingressnodefirewall
spec:
  interfaces:
  - eth0
  nodeSelector:
    matchLabels:
      <ingress_firewall_label_name>: <label_value> 1
  ingress:
  - sourceCIDRs:
       - 172.16.0.0/12
    rules:
    - order: 10
      protocolConfig:
        protocol: ICMP
        icmp:
          icmpType: 8 #ICMP Echo request
      action: Deny
    - order: 20
      protocolConfig:
        protocol: TCP
        tcp:
          ports: "8000-9000"
      action: Deny
  - sourceCIDRs:
       - fc00:f853:ccd:e793::0/64
    rules:
    - order: 10
      protocolConfig:
        protocol: ICMPv6
        icmpv6:
          icmpType: 128 #ICMPV6 Echo request
      action: Deny
```


A <label_name> and a <label_value> must exist on the node and must match the nodeselector label and value applied to the nodes you want the ingressfirewallconfig CR to run on. The <label_value> can be true or false. By using nodeSelector labels, you can target separate groups of nodes to apply different rules to using the ingressfirewallconfig CR.

## Zero trust Ingress Node Firewall rules object example

Zero trust Ingress Node Firewall rules can provide additional security to multi-interface clusters. For example, you can use zero trust Ingress Node Firewall rules to drop all traffic on a specific interface except for SSH.

A complete configuration of a zero trust Ingress Node Firewall rule set is specified in the following example:

# Ingress Node Firewall Operator integration

The Ingress Node Firewall uses eBPF programs to implement some of its key firewall functionality. By default these eBPF programs are loaded into the kernel using a mechanism specific to the Ingress Node Firewall. You can configure the Ingress Node Firewall Operator to use the eBPF Manager Operator for loading and managing these programs instead.

When this integration is enabled, the following limitations apply:

* The Ingress Node Firewall Operator uses TCX if XDP is not available and TCX is incompatible with bpfman.
* The Ingress Node Firewall Operator daemon set pods remain in the ContainerCreating state until the firewall rules are applied.
* The Ingress Node Firewall Operator daemon set pods run as privileged.

# Configuring Ingress Node Firewall Operator to use the eBPF Manager Operator

The Ingress Node Firewall uses eBPF programs to implement some of its key firewall functionality. By default these eBPF programs are loaded into the kernel using a mechanism specific to the Ingress Node Firewall.

As a cluster administrator, you can configure the Ingress Node Firewall Operator to use the eBPF Manager Operator for loading and managing these programs instead, adding additional security and observability functionality.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have an account with administrator privileges.
* You installed the Ingress Node Firewall Operator.
* You have installed the eBPF Manager Operator.

1. Apply the following labels to the ingress-node-firewall-system namespace:

```terminal
$ oc label namespace openshift-ingress-node-firewall \
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce=privileged \
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn=privileged --overwrite
```

2. Edit the IngressNodeFirewallConfig object named ingressnodefirewallconfig and set the ebpfProgramManagerMode field:
Ingress Node Firewall Operator configuration object

```yaml
apiVersion: ingressnodefirewall.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: IngressNodeFirewallConfig
metadata:
  name: ingressnodefirewallconfig
  namespace: openshift-ingress-node-firewall
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ""
  ebpfProgramManagerMode: <ebpf_mode>
```

where:
<ebpf_mode>: Specifies whether or not the Ingress Node Firewall Operator uses the eBPF Manager Operator to manage eBPF programs. Must be either true or false. If unset, eBPF Manager is not used.

# Viewing Ingress Node Firewall Operator rules

1. Run the following command to view all current rules :

```terminal
$ oc get ingressnodefirewall
```

2. Choose one of the returned <resource> names and run the following command to view the rules or configs:

```terminal
$ oc get <resource> <name> -o yaml
```


# Troubleshooting the Ingress Node Firewall Operator

* Run the following command to list installed Ingress Node Firewall custom resource definitions (CRD):

```terminal
$ oc get crds | grep ingressnodefirewall
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
ingressnodefirewallconfigs.ingressnodefirewall.openshift.io       2022-08-25T10:03:01Z
ingressnodefirewallnodestates.ingressnodefirewall.openshift.io    2022-08-25T10:03:00Z
ingressnodefirewalls.ingressnodefirewall.openshift.io             2022-08-25T10:03:00Z
```

* Run the following command to view the state of the Ingress Node Firewall Operator:

```terminal
$ oc get pods -n openshift-ingress-node-firewall
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                                       READY  STATUS         RESTARTS  AGE
ingress-node-firewall-controller-manager   2/2    Running        0         5d21h
ingress-node-firewall-daemon-pqx56         3/3    Running        0         5d21h
```


The following fields provide information about the status of the Operator:
READY, STATUS, AGE, and RESTARTS. The STATUS field is Running when the Ingress Node Firewall Operator is deploying a daemon set to the assigned nodes.
* Run the following command to collect all ingress firewall node pods' logs:

```terminal
$ oc adm must-gather – gather_ingress_node_firewall
```


The logs are available in the sos node&#8217;s report containing eBPF bpftool outputs at /sos_commands/ebpf. These reports include lookup tables used or updated as the ingress firewall XDP handles packet processing, updates statistics, and emits events.
