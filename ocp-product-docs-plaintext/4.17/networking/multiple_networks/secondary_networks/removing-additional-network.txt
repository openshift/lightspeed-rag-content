# Removing an additional network attachment definition

As a cluster administrator, you can remove an additional network from your
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. The additional network is not removed from any pods it
is attached to.

* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

To remove an additional network from your cluster, complete the following steps:

1. Edit the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) in your default text editor by running
the following command:

```terminal
$ oc edit networks.operator.openshift.io cluster
```

2. Modify the CR by removing the configuration from the additionalNetworks
collection for the network attachment definition you are removing.

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  additionalNetworks: [] 1
```

If you are removing the configuration mapping for the only additional
network attachment definition in the additionalNetworks collection, you must
specify an empty collection.
3. Save your changes and quit the text editor to commit your changes.
4. Optional: Confirm that the additional network CR was deleted by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get network-attachment-definition --all-namespaces
```
