# Logging 6.1



# Logging 6.1.4 Release Notes

This release includes Logging for Red Hat OpenShift Bug Fix Release 6.1.4.

## Bug fixes

* Before this update, Red Hat Managed Elasticsearch failed to receive logs if the index name did not follow the required patterns (app-, infra-, audit-), resulting in an index_not_found_exception error due to a restricted automatic index creation. With this update, improved documentation and explanations in the oc explain obsclf.spec.outputs.elasticsearch.index command clarify the index naming limitations, helping users configure log forwarding correctly.
(LOG-6623)
* Before this update, when you used 1x.pico as the LokiStack size, the number of delete workers was set to zero. This issue occurred because of an error in the Operator that generates the Loki configuration. With this update, the number of delete workers is set to ten.
(LOG-6797)
* Before this update, the Operator failed to update the securitycontextconstraint object required by the log collector, which was a regression from previous releases. With this update, the Operator restores the cluster role to the service account and updates the resource.

# Logging 6.1.3 Release Notes

This release includes Logging for Red Hat OpenShift Bug Fix Release 6.1.3.

## Bug Fixes

* Before this update, when using the new 1x.pico size with the Loki Operator, the PodDisruptionBudget created for the Ingester pod allowed Kubernetes to evict two of the three Ingester pods. With this update, the Operator now creates a PodDisruptionBudget that allows eviction of only a single Ingester pod.
(LOG-6693)
* Before this update, the Operator did not support templating of syslog facility and severity level, which was consistent with the rest of the API. Instead, the Operator relied upon the 5.x API, which is no longer supported. With this update, the Operator supports templating by adding the required validation to the API and rejecting resources that do not match the required format.
(LOG-6788)
* Before this update, empty OTEL tuning configuration caused a validation error. With this update, the validation rules allow empty OTEL tuning configurations.
(LOG-6532)

* CVE-2024-9287
* CVE-2024-12797

# Logging 6.1.2 Release Notes

This release includes Logging for Red Hat OpenShift Bug Fix Release 6.1.2.

## New Features and Enhancements

* This enhancement adds OTel semantic stream labels to the lokiStack output so that you can query logs by using both ViaQ and OTel stream labels.
(LOG-6579)

## Bug Fixes

* Before this update, the collector alerting rules contained summary and message fields. With this update, the collector alerting rules contain summary and description fields.
(LOG-6126)
* Before this update, the collector metrics dashboard could get removed after an Operator upgrade due to a race condition during the transition from the old to the new pod deployment. With this update, labels are added to the dashboard ConfigMap to identify the upgraded deployment as the current owner so that it will not be removed.
(LOG-6280)
* Before this update, when you included infrastructure namespaces in application inputs, their log_type would be set to application. With this update, the log_type of infrastructure namespaces included in application inputs is set to infrastructure.
(LOG-6373)
* Before this update, the Cluster Logging Operator used a cached client to fetch the SecurityContextConstraint cluster resource, which could result in an error when the cache is invalid. With this update, the Operator now always retrieves data from the API server instead of using a cache.
(LOG-6418)
* Before this update, the logging must-gather did not collect resources such as UIPlugin, ClusterLogForwarder, LogFileMetricExporter, and LokiStack. With this update, the must-gather now collects all of these resources and places them in their respective namespace directory instead of the cluster-logging directory.
(LOG-6422)
* Before this update, the Vector startup script attempted to delete buffer lock files during startup. With this update, the Vector startup script no longer attempts to delete buffer lock files during startup.
(LOG-6506)
* Before this update, the API documentation incorrectly claimed that lokiStack outputs would default the target namespace, which could prevent the collector from writing to that output. With this update, this claim has been removed from the API documentation and the Cluster Logging Operator now validates that a target namespace is present.
(LOG-6573)
* Before this update, the Cluster Logging Operator could deploy the collector with output configurations that were not referenced by any inputs. With this update, a validation check for the ClusterLogForwarder resource prevents the Operator from deploying the collector.
(LOG-6585)

* CVE-2019-12900

# Logging 6.1.1 Release Notes

This release includes Logging for Red Hat OpenShift Bug Fix Release 6.1.1.

## New Features and Enhancements

* With this update, the Loki Operator supports configuring the workload identity federation on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) by using the Cluster Credential Operator (CCO) in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.17 or later. (LOG-6420)

## Bug Fixes

* Before this update, the collector was discarding longer audit log messages with the following error message: Internal log [Found line that exceeds max_line_bytes; discarding.]. With this update, the discarding of longer audit messages is avoided by increasing the audit configuration thresholds: The maximum line size, max_line_bytes, is 3145728 bytes. The maximum number of bytes read during a read cycle, max_read_bytes, is 262144 bytes. (LOG-6379)
* Before this update, an input receiver service was repeatedly created and deleted, causing issues with mounting the TLS secrets. With this update, the service is created once and only deleted if it is not defined in the ClusterLogForwarder custom resource. (LOG-6383)
* Before this update, pipeline validation might have entered an infinite loop if a name was a substring of another name. With this update, stricter name equality checks prevent the infinite loop. (LOG-6405)
* Before this update, the collector alerting rules included the summary and message fields. With this update, the collector alerting rules include the summary and description fields. (LOG-6407)
* Before this update, setting up the custom audit inputs in the ClusterLogForwarder custom resource with configured LokiStack output caused errors due to the nil pointer dereference. With this update, the Operator performs the nil checks, preventing such errors. (LOG-6449)
* Before this update, the ValidLokistackOTLPOutputs condition appeared in the status of the ClusterLogForwarder custom resource even when the output type is not LokiStack. With this update, the ValidLokistackOTLPOutputs condition is removed, and the validation messages for the existing output conditions are corrected. (LOG-6469)
* Before this update, the collector did not correctly mount the /var/log/oauth-server/ path, which prevented the collection of the audit logs. With this update, the volume mount is added, and the audit logs are collected as expected. (LOG-6484)
* Before this update, the must-gather script of the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator might have failed to gather the LokiStack data. With this update, the must-gather script is fixed, and the LokiStack data is gathered reliably. (LOG-6498)
* Before this update, the collector did not correctly mount the oauth-apiserver audit log file. As a result, such audit logs were not collected. With this update, the volume mount is correctly mounted, and the logs are collected as expected. (LOG-6533)

# Logging 6.1.0 Release Notes

This release includes Logging for Red Hat OpenShift Bug Fix Release 6.1.0.

## New Features and Enhancements

### Log Collection

* This enhancement adds the source iostream to the attributes sent from collected container logs. The value is set to either stdout or stderr based on how the collector received it. (LOG-5292)
* With this update, the default memory limit for the collector increases from 1024 Mi to 2048 Mi. Users should adjust resource limits based on their cluster’s specific needs and specifications. (LOG-6072)
* With this update, users can now set the syslog output delivery mode of the ClusterLogForwarder CR to either AtLeastOnce or AtMostOnce. (LOG-6355)

### Log Storage

* With this update, the new 1x.pico LokiStack size supports clusters with fewer workloads and lower log volumes (up to 50GB/day). (LOG-5939)
