# Installing log storage


You can use the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) or the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console to deploy a log store on your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

[NOTE]
----
The Logging 5.9 release does not contain an updated version of the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator. If you currently use the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator released with Logging 5.8, it will continue to work with Logging until the EOL of Logging 5.8. As an alternative to using the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator to manage the default log storage, you can use the Loki Operator. For more information on the Logging lifecycle dates, see Platform Agnostic Operators.
----

# Deploying a Loki log store

You can use the Loki Operator to deploy an internal Loki log store on your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
After install the Loki Operator, you must configure Loki object storage by creating a secret, and create a LokiStack custom resource (CR).

## Loki deployment sizing

Sizing for Loki follows the format of 1x.<size> where the value 1x is number of instances and <size> specifies performance capabilities.


[IMPORTANT]
----
It is not possible to change the number 1x for the deployment size.
----



## Installing Logging and the Loki Operator using the web console

To install and configure logging on your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, an Operator such as Loki Operator for log storage must be installed first. This can be done from the OperatorHub within the web console.

* You have access to a supported object store (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure, Swift, Minio, OpenShift Data Foundation).
* You have administrator permissions.
* You have access to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

1. In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console Administrator perspective, go to Operators -> OperatorHub.
2. Type Loki Operator in the Filter by keyword field. Click Loki Operator in the list of available Operators, and then click Install.

[IMPORTANT]
----
The Community Loki Operator is not supported by Red Hat.
----
3. Select stable or stable-x.y as the Update channel.

[NOTE]
----
The stable channel only provides updates to the most recent release of logging. To continue receiving updates for prior releases, you must change your subscription channel to stable-x.y, where x.y represents the major and minor version of logging you have installed. For example, stable-5.7.
----

The Loki Operator must be deployed to the global operator group namespace openshift-operators-redhat, so the Installation mode and Installed Namespace are already selected. If this namespace does not already exist, it is created for you.
4. Select Enable Operator-recommended cluster monitoring on this namespace.

This option sets the openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true" label in the Namespace object. You must select this option to ensure that cluster monitoring scrapes the openshift-operators-redhat namespace.
5. For Update approval select Automatic, then click Install.

If the approval strategy in the subscription is set to Automatic, the update process initiates as soon as a new Operator version is available in the selected channel. If the approval strategy is set to Manual, you must manually approve pending updates.
6. Install the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator:
1. In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, click Operators -> OperatorHub.
2. Choose  Red Hat OpenShift Logging from the list of available Operators, and click Install.
3. Ensure that the A specific namespace on the cluster is selected under Installation Mode.
4. Ensure that Operator recommended namespace is openshift-logging under Installed Namespace.
5. Select Enable Operator recommended cluster monitoring on this namespace.

This option sets the openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true" label in the Namespace object.
You must select this option to ensure that cluster monitoring
scrapes the openshift-logging namespace.
6. Select stable-5.y as the Update Channel.
7. Select an Approval Strategy.
* The Automatic strategy allows Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to automatically update the Operator when a new version is available.
* The Manual strategy requires a user with appropriate credentials to approve the Operator update.
8. Click Install.
7. Go to the Operators -> Installed Operators page. Click the All instances tab.
8. From the Create new drop-down list, select LokiStack.
9. Select YAML view, and then use the following template to create a LokiStack CR:

```yaml
apiVersion: loki.grafana.com/v1
kind: LokiStack
metadata:
  name: logging-loki 1
  namespace: openshift-logging 2
spec:
  size: 1x.small 3
  storage:
    schemas:
    - version: v12
      effectiveDate: "2022-06-01"
    secret:
      name: logging-loki-s3 4
      type: s3 5
      credentialMode: 6
  storageClassName: <storage_class_name> 7
  tenants:
    mode: openshift-logging 8
```

Use the name logging-loki.
You must specify the openshift-logging namespace.
Specify the deployment size. In the logging 5.8 and later versions, the supported size options for production instances of Loki are 1x.extra-small, 1x.small, or 1x.medium.
Specify the name of your log store secret.
Specify the corresponding storage type.
Optional field, logging 5.9 and later. Supported user configured values are as follows: static is the default authentication mode available for all supported object storage types using credentials stored in a Secret. token for short-lived tokens retrieved from a credential source. In this mode the static configuration does not contain credentials needed for the object storage. Instead, they are generated during runtime using a service, which allows for shorter-lived credentials and much more granular control. This authentication mode is not supported for all object storage types. token-cco is the default value when Loki is running on managed STS mode and using CCO on STS/WIF clusters.
Specify the name of a storage class for temporary storage. For best performance, specify a storage class that allocates block storage. Available storage classes for your cluster can be listed by using the oc get storageclasses command.
LokiStack defaults to running in multi-tenant mode, which cannot be modified. One tenant is provided for each log type: audit, infrastructure, and application logs. This enables access control for individual users and user groups to different log streams.

[IMPORTANT]
----
It is not possible to change the number 1x for the deployment size.
----
10. Click Create.
11. Create an OpenShift Logging instance:
1. Switch to the Administration -> Custom Resource Definitions page.
2. On the Custom Resource Definitions page, click ClusterLogging.
3. On the Custom Resource Definition details page, select View Instances from the Actions menu.
4. On the ClusterLoggings page, click Create ClusterLogging.

You might have to refresh the page to load the data.
5. In the YAML field, replace the code with the following:

```yaml
apiVersion: logging.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterLogging
metadata:
  name: instance 1
  namespace: openshift-logging 2
spec:
  collection:
    type: vector
  logStore:
    lokistack:
      name: logging-loki
    retentionPolicy:
      application:
        maxAge: 7d
      audit:
        maxAge: 7d
      infra:
        maxAge: 7d
    type: lokistack
  visualization:
    ocpConsole:
      logsLimit: 15

  managementState: Managed
```

Name must be instance.
Namespace must be openshift-logging.

1. Go to Operators -> Installed Operators.
2. Make sure the openshift-logging project is selected.
3. In the Status column, verify that you see green checkmarks with InstallSucceeded and the text Up to date.


[NOTE]
----
An Operator might display a Failed status before the installation finishes. If the Operator install completes with an InstallSucceeded message, refresh the page.
----

## Creating a secret for Loki object storage by using the web console

To configure Loki object storage, you must create a secret. You can create a secret by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

* You have administrator permissions.
* You have access to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.
* You installed the Loki Operator.

1. Go to Workloads -> Secrets in the Administrator perspective of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.
2. From the Create drop-down list, select From YAML.
3. Create a secret that uses the access_key_id and access_key_secret fields to specify your credentials and the bucketnames, endpoint, and region fields to define the object storage location. AWS is used in the following example:
Example Secret object

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: logging-loki-s3
  namespace: openshift-logging
stringData:
  access_key_id: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
  access_key_secret: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
  bucketnames: s3-bucket-name
  endpoint: https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com
  region: eu-central-1
```


* Loki object storage

## Workload identity federation

Workload identity federation enables authentication to cloud-based log stores using short-lived tokens.

* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14 and later
* Logging 5.9 and later

* If you use the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console to install the Loki Operator, clusters that use short-lived tokens are automatically detected. You are prompted to create roles and supply the data required for the Loki Operator to create a CredentialsRequest object, which populates a secret.
* If you use the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) to install the Loki Operator, you must manually create a subscription object using the appropriate template for your storage provider, as shown in the following examples. This authentication strategy is only supported for the storage providers indicated.


```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: loki-operator
  namespace: openshift-operators-redhat
spec:
  channel: "stable-5.9"
  installPlanApproval: Manual
  name: loki-operator
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
  config:
    env:
      - name: CLIENTID
        value: <your_client_id>
      - name: TENANTID
        value: <your_tenant_id>
      - name: SUBSCRIPTIONID
        value: <your_subscription_id>
      - name: REGION
        value: <your_region>
```



```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: loki-operator
  namespace: openshift-operators-redhat
spec:
  channel: "stable-5.9"
  installPlanApproval: Manual
  name: loki-operator
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
  config:
    env:
    - name: ROLEARN
      value: <role_ARN>
```


## Creating a LokiStack custom resource by using the web console

You can create a LokiStack custom resource (CR) by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

* You have administrator permissions.
* You have access to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.
* You installed the Loki Operator.

1. Go to the Operators -> Installed Operators page. Click the All instances tab.
2. From the Create new drop-down list, select LokiStack.
3. Select YAML view, and then use the following template to create a LokiStack CR:

```yaml
apiVersion: loki.grafana.com/v1
kind: LokiStack
metadata:
  name: logging-loki 1
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
  size: 1x.small 2
  storage:
    schemas:
      - effectiveDate: '2023-10-15'
        version: v13
    secret:
      name: logging-loki-s3 3
      type: s3 4
      credentialMode: 5
  storageClassName: <storage_class_name> 6
  tenants:
    mode: openshift-logging
```

Use the name logging-loki.
Specify the deployment size. In the logging 5.8 and later versions, the supported size options for production instances of Loki are 1x.extra-small, 1x.small, or 1x.medium.
Specify the secret used for your log storage.
Specify the corresponding storage type.
Optional field, logging 5.9 and later. Supported user configured values are as follows: static is the default authentication mode available for all supported object storage types using credentials stored in a Secret. token for short-lived tokens retrieved from a credential source. In this mode the static configuration does not contain credentials needed for the object storage. Instead, they are generated during runtime using a service, which allows for shorter-lived credentials and much more granular control. This authentication mode is not supported for all object storage types. token-cco is the default value when Loki is running on managed STS mode and using CCO on STS/WIF clusters.
Enter the name of a storage class for temporary storage. For best performance, specify a storage class that allocates block storage. Available storage classes for your cluster can be listed by using the oc get storageclasses command.

## Installing Logging and the Loki Operator using the CLI

To install and configure logging on your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, an Operator such as Loki Operator for log storage must be installed first. This can be done from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI.

* You have administrator permissions.
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have access to a supported object store. For example: AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure, Swift, Minio, or OpenShift Data Foundation.


[NOTE]
----
The stable channel only provides updates to the most recent release of logging. To continue receiving updates for prior releases, you must change your subscription channel to stable-x.y, where x.y represents the major and minor version of logging you have installed. For example, stable-5.7.
----

1. Create a Namespace object for Loki Operator:
Example Namespace object

```yaml
apiVersion: v1

  annotations:
    openshift.io/node-selector: ""
  labels:
    openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true" 2
```

You must specify the openshift-operators-redhat namespace. To prevent possible conflicts with metrics, you should configure the Prometheus Cluster Monitoring stack to scrape metrics from the openshift-operators-redhat namespace and not the openshift-operators namespace. The openshift-operators namespace might contain community Operators, which are untrusted and could publish a metric with the same name as an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform metric, which would cause conflicts.
A string value that specifies the label as shown to ensure that cluster monitoring scrapes the openshift-operators-redhat namespace.
2. Apply the Namespace object by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
```

3. Create a Subscription object for Loki Operator:
Example Subscription object

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: loki-operator
  namespace: openshift-operators-redhat 1
spec:
  channel: stable 2
  name: loki-operator
  source: redhat-operators 3
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
```

You must specify the openshift-operators-redhat namespace.
Specify stable, or stable-5.<y> as the channel.
Specify redhat-operators. If your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster is installed on a restricted network, also known as a disconnected cluster, specify the name of the CatalogSource object you created when you configured the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).
4. Apply the Subscription object by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
```

5. Create a namespace object for the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator:
Example namespace object

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: openshift-logging 1
annotations:
    openshift.io/node-selector: ""
labels:
    openshift.io/cluster-logging: "true"
    openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true" 2
```

The Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator is only deployable to the openshift-logging namespace.
A string value that specifies the label as shown to ensure that cluster monitoring scrapes the openshift-operators-redhat namespace.
6. Apply the namespace object by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
```

7. Create an OperatorGroup object
Example OperatorGroup object

```yaml

metadata:
  name: cluster-logging
  namespace: openshift-logging 1
spec:
  channel: stable 2
  name: cluster-logging
  source: redhat-operators 3
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
```

You must specify the openshift-logging namespace.
Specify stable, or stable-5.<y> as the channel.
Specify redhat-operators. If your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster is installed on a restricted network, also known as a disconnected cluster, specify the name of the CatalogSource object you created when you configured the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).
10. Apply the Subscription object by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
```

11. Create a LokiStack CR:
Example LokiStack CR

```yaml
apiVersion: loki.grafana.com/v1
kind: LokiStack
metadata:
  name: logging-loki 1
  namespace: openshift-logging 2
spec:
  size: 1x.small 3
  storage:
    schemas:

In this mode the static configuration does not contain credentials needed for the object storage. Instead, they are generated during runtime using a service, which allows for shorter-lived credentials and much more granular control. This authentication mode is not supported for all object storage types. token-cco is the default value when Loki is running on managed STS mode and using CCO on STS/WIF clusters.
Specify the name of a storage class for temporary storage. For best performance, specify a storage class that allocates block storage. Available storage classes for your cluster can be listed by using the oc get storageclasses command.
LokiStack defaults to running in multi-tenant mode, which cannot be modified. One tenant is provided for each log type: audit, infrastructure, and application logs. This enables access control for individual users and user groups to different log streams.
12. Apply the LokiStack CR object by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
```

13. Create a ClusterLogging CR object:
Example ClusterLogging CR object

```yaml
apiVersion: logging.openshift.io/v1

## Creating a secret for Loki object storage by using the CLI

To configure Loki object storage, you must create a secret. You can do this by using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have administrator permissions.
* You installed the Loki Operator.
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* Create a secret in the directory that contains your certificate and key files by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create secret generic -n openshift-logging <your_secret_name> \
 --from-file=tls.key=<your_key_file>
 --from-file=tls.crt=<your_crt_file>
 --from-file=ca-bundle.crt=<your_bundle_file>
 --from-literal=username=<your_username>
 --from-literal=password=<your_password>
```



[NOTE]
----
Use generic or opaque secrets for best results.
----

* Verify that a secret was created by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get secrets
```


* Loki object storage

## Creating a LokiStack custom resource by using the CLI

You can create a LokiStack custom resource (CR) by using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have administrator permissions.
* You installed the Loki Operator.
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

1. Create a LokiStack CR:


```yaml

  storageClassName: <storage_class_name> 6
  tenants:
    mode: openshift-logging
```


Use the name logging-loki.
Specify the deployment size. In the logging 5.8 and later versions, the supported size options for production instances of Loki are 1x.extra-small, 1x.small, or 1x.medium.
Specify the secret used for your log storage.
Specify the corresponding storage type.
Optional field, logging 5.9 and later. Supported user configured values are as follows: static is the default authentication mode available for all supported object storage types using credentials stored in a Secret. token for short-lived tokens retrieved from a credential source. In this mode the static configuration does not contain credentials needed for the object storage. Instead, they are generated during runtime using a service, which allows for shorter-lived credentials and much more granular control. This authentication mode is not supported for all object storage types. token-cco is the default value when Loki is running on managed STS mode and using CCO on STS/WIF clusters.
Enter the name of a storage class for temporary storage. For best performance, specify a storage class that allocates block storage. Available storage classes for your cluster can be listed by using the oc get storageclasses command.
1. Apply the LokiStack CR by running the following command:

* Verify the installation by listing the pods in the openshift-logging project by running the following command and observing the output:

```terminal
$ oc get pods -n openshift-logging
```


Confirm that you see several pods for components of the logging, similar to the following list:
Example output

```terminal

# Loki object storage

The Loki Operator supports AWS S3, as well as other S3 compatible object stores such as Minio and OpenShift Data Foundation. Azure, GCS, and Swift are also supported.

The recommended nomenclature for Loki storage is logging-loki-<your_storage_provider>.

The following table shows the type values within the LokiStack custom resource (CR) for each storage provider. For more information, see the section on your storage provider.



## AWS storage

* You installed the Loki Operator.
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You created a bucket on AWS.
* You created an AWS IAM Policy and IAM User.

* Create an object storage secret with the name logging-loki-aws by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create secret generic logging-loki-aws \
  --from-literal=bucketnames="<bucket_name>" \
  --from-literal=endpoint="<aws_bucket_endpoint>" \
  --from-literal=access_key_id="<aws_access_key_id>" \
  --from-literal=access_key_secret="<aws_access_key_secret>" \
  --from-literal=region="<aws_region_of_your_bucket>"
```


### AWS storage for STS enabled clusters

If your cluster has STS enabled, the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) supports short-term authentication using AWS tokens.

You can create the Loki object storage secret manually by running the following command:


```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-logging create secret generic "logging-loki-aws" \
--from-literal=bucketnames="<s3_bucket_name>" \
--from-literal=region="<bucket_region>" \
--from-literal=audience="<oidc_audience>" 1
```


Optional annotation, default value is openshift.

## Azure storage

* You installed the Loki Operator.
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You created a bucket on Azure.

* Create an object storage secret with the name logging-loki-azure by running the following command:

```terminal

  --from-literal=environment="<azure_environment>" \ 1
  --from-literal=account_name="<azure_account_name>" \
  --from-literal=account_key="<azure_account_key>"
```

Supported environment values are AzureGlobal, AzureChinaCloud, AzureGermanCloud, or AzureUSGovernment.

### Azure storage for Microsoft Entra Workload ID enabled clusters

If your cluster has Microsoft Entra Workload ID enabled, the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) supports short-term authentication using Workload ID.

You can create the Loki object storage secret manually by running the following command:


```terminal

# Deploying an Elasticsearch log store

You can use the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator to deploy an internal Elasticsearch log store on your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.


[NOTE]
----
The Logging 5.9 release does not contain an updated version of the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator. If you currently use the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator released with Logging 5.8, it will continue to work with Logging until the EOL of Logging 5.8. As an alternative to using the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator to manage the default log storage, you can use the Loki Operator. For more information on the Logging lifecycle dates, see Platform Agnostic Operators.
----

## Storage considerations for Elasticsearch

A persistent volume is required for each Elasticsearch deployment configuration. On Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform this is achieved using persistent volume claims (PVCs).


[NOTE]
----
If you use a local volume for persistent storage, do not use a raw block volume, which is described with volumeMode: block in the LocalVolume object. Elasticsearch cannot use raw block volumes.
----

The OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator names the PVCs using the Elasticsearch resource name.

Fluentd ships any logs from systemd journal and /var/log/containers/*.log to Elasticsearch.

Elasticsearch requires sufficient memory to perform large merge operations. If it does not have enough memory, it becomes unresponsive. To avoid this problem, evaluate how much application log data you need, and allocate approximately double that amount of free storage capacity.

By default, when storage capacity is 85% full, Elasticsearch stops allocating new data to the node. At 90%, Elasticsearch attempts to relocate existing shards from that node to other nodes if possible. But if no nodes have a free capacity below 85%, Elasticsearch effectively rejects creating new indices and becomes RED.


[NOTE]
----
These low and high watermark values are Elasticsearch defaults in the current release. You can modify these default values. Although the alerts use the same default values, you cannot change these values in the alerts.
----

## Installing the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator by using the web console

The OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator creates and manages the Elasticsearch cluster used by OpenShift Logging.

* Elasticsearch is a memory-intensive application. Each Elasticsearch node needs at least 16GB of memory for both memory requests and limits, unless you specify otherwise in the ClusterLogging custom resource.

The initial set of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform nodes might not be large enough to support the Elasticsearch cluster. You must add additional nodes to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster to run with the recommended or higher memory, up to a maximum of 64GB for each Elasticsearch node.

Elasticsearch nodes can operate with a lower memory setting, though this is not recommended for production environments.
* Ensure that you have the necessary persistent storage for Elasticsearch. Note that each Elasticsearch node
requires its own storage volume.

[NOTE]
----
If you use a local volume for persistent storage, do not use a raw block volume, which is described with volumeMode: block in the LocalVolume object. Elasticsearch cannot use raw block volumes.
----

1. In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, click Operators -> OperatorHub.
2. Click OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator from the list of available Operators, and click Install.
3. Ensure that the All namespaces on the cluster is selected under Installation mode.
4. Ensure that openshift-operators-redhat is selected under Installed Namespace.

You must specify the openshift-operators-redhat namespace. The openshift-operators namespace might contain Community Operators, which are untrusted and could publish a metric with the same name as Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform metric, which would cause conflicts.
5. Select Enable operator recommended cluster monitoring on this namespace.

This option sets the openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true" label in the Namespace object. You must select this option to ensure that cluster monitoring scrapes the openshift-operators-redhat namespace.
6. Select stable-5.x as the Update channel.
7. Select an Update approval strategy:
* The Automatic strategy allows Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to automatically update the Operator when a new version is available.
* The Manual strategy requires a user with appropriate credentials to approve the Operator update.
8. Click Install.

1. Verify that the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator installed by switching to the Operators → Installed Operators page.
2. Ensure that OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator is listed in all projects with a Status of Succeeded.

## Installing the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator by using the CLI

You can use the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) to install the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator.

* Ensure that you have the necessary persistent storage for Elasticsearch. Note that each Elasticsearch node requires its own storage volume.

[NOTE]
----
If you use a local volume for persistent storage, do not use a raw block volume, which is described with volumeMode: block in the LocalVolume object. Elasticsearch cannot use raw block volumes.
----

Elasticsearch is a memory-intensive application. By default, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installs three Elasticsearch nodes with memory requests and limits of 16 GB. This initial set of three Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform nodes might not have enough memory to run Elasticsearch within your cluster. If you experience memory issues that are related to Elasticsearch, add more Elasticsearch nodes to your cluster rather than increasing the memory on existing nodes.
* You have administrator permissions.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

1. Create a Namespace object as a YAML file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: openshift-operators-redhat 1
  annotations:
    openshift.io/node-selector: ""
  labels:
    openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true" 2
```

You must specify the openshift-operators-redhat namespace. To prevent possible conflicts with metrics, configure the Prometheus Cluster Monitoring stack to scrape metrics from the openshift-operators-redhat namespace and not the openshift-operators namespace. The openshift-operators namespace might contain community Operators, which are untrusted and could publish a metric with the same name as
metric, which would cause conflicts.
String. You must specify this label as shown to ensure that cluster monitoring scrapes the openshift-operators-redhat namespace.
2. Apply the Namespace object by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
```

3. Create an OperatorGroup object  as a YAML file:

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: openshift-operators-redhat
  namespace: openshift-operators-redhat 1
spec: {}
```

You must specify the openshift-operators-redhat namespace.
4. Apply the OperatorGroup object by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
```

5. Create a Subscription object to subscribe the namespace to the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator:
Example Subscription

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: elasticsearch-operator
  namespace: openshift-operators-redhat 1
spec:
  channel: stable-x.y 2
  installPlanApproval: Automatic 3
  source: redhat-operators 4
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
  name: elasticsearch-operator
```

You must specify the openshift-operators-redhat namespace.
Specify stable, or stable-x.y as the channel. See the following note.
Automatic allows the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to automatically update the Operator when a new version is available. Manual requires a user with appropriate credentials to approve the Operator update.
Specify redhat-operators. If your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster is installed on a restricted network, also known as a disconnected cluster,
specify the name of the CatalogSource object created when you configured the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

[NOTE]
----
Specifying stable installs the current version of the latest stable release. Using stable with installPlanApproval: "Automatic" automatically upgrades your Operators to the latest stable major and minor release.
Specifying stable-x.y installs the current minor version of a specific major release. Using stable-x.y with installPlanApproval: "Automatic" automatically upgrades your Operators to the latest stable minor release within the major release.
----
6. Apply the subscription by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
```


The OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator is installed to the openshift-operators-redhat namespace and copied to each project in the cluster.

1. Run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get csv -n --all-namespaces
```

2. Observe the output and confirm that pods for the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator exist in each namespace
Example output

```terminal
NAMESPACE                                          NAME                            DISPLAY                            VERSION          REPLACES                        PHASE

# Configuring log storage

You can configure which log storage type your logging uses by modifying the ClusterLogging custom resource (CR).

* You have administrator permissions.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have installed the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator and an internal log store that is either the LokiStack or Elasticsearch.
* You have created a ClusterLogging CR.


[NOTE]
----
The Logging 5.9 release does not contain an updated version of the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator. If you currently use the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator released with Logging 5.8, it will continue to work with Logging until the EOL of Logging 5.8. As an alternative to using the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator to manage the default log storage, you can use the Loki Operator. For more information on the Logging lifecycle dates, see Platform Agnostic Operators.
----

1. Modify the ClusterLogging CR logStore spec:
ClusterLogging CR example

```yaml
apiVersion: logging.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterLogging
metadata:
# ...
spec:
# ...
  logStore:
    type: <log_store_type> 1
    elasticsearch: 2
      nodeCount: <integer>
      resources: {}
      storage: {}
      redundancyPolicy: <redundancy_type> 3
    lokistack: 4
      name: {}
# ...
```

Specify the log store type. This can be either lokistack or elasticsearch.
Optional configuration options for the Elasticsearch log store.
Specify the redundancy type. This value can be ZeroRedundancy, SingleRedundancy, MultipleRedundancy, or FullRedundancy.
Optional configuration options for LokiStack.
Example ClusterLogging CR to specify LokiStack as the log store

```yaml
apiVersion: logging.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterLogging
metadata:
  name: instance
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
  managementState: Managed
  logStore:
    type: lokistack
    lokistack:
      name: logging-loki
# ...
```

2. Apply the ClusterLogging CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
```
