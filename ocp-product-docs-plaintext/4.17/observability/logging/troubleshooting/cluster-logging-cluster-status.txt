# Viewing the status of the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator

You can view the status of the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator.

* The Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator and OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator are installed.

1. Change to the openshift-logging project by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc project openshift-logging
```

2. Get the ClusterLogging instance status by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get clusterlogging instance -o yaml
```

Example output

```yaml

## Example condition messages

The following are examples of some condition messages from the Status.Nodes section of the ClusterLogging instance.

A status message similar to the following indicates a node has exceeded the configured low watermark and no shard will be allocated to this node:


```yaml
  nodes:
  - conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: 2019-03-15T15:57:22Z
      message: Disk storage usage for node is 27.5gb (36.74%). Shards will be not
        be allocated on this node.
      reason: Disk Watermark Low
      status: "True"
      type: NodeStorage
    deploymentName: example-elasticsearch-clientdatamaster-0-1
    upgradeStatus: {}
```


A status message similar to the following indicates a node has exceeded the configured high watermark and shards will be relocated to other nodes:


```yaml
  nodes:
  - conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: 2019-03-15T16:04:45Z
      message: Disk storage usage for node is 27.5gb (36.74%). Shards will be relocated
        from this node.
      reason: Disk Watermark High
      status: "True"
      type: NodeStorage
    deploymentName: cluster-logging-operator
    upgradeStatus: {}
```


A status message similar to the following indicates the Elasticsearch node selector in the CR does not match any nodes in the cluster:


```terminal
