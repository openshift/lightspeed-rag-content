# New features and enhancements

Operator network policy improvements:: With this update, the Operator network policy for the Kubernetes API server becomes more specific and uses the API Server namespace and pod labels.
Filelog Receiver GA:: With this update, the Filelog Receiver, which was a Technology Preview feature, reaches general availability (GA). This receiver tails and parses logs from files. You can use it, as a sidecar container or DaemonSet, to collect logs from pod filesystems.

# Technology Preview features

Google Cloud Exporter (Technology Preview):: This release introduces the Google Cloud Exporter as a Technology Preview feature for the Collector of the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry. You can use the Google Cloud Exporter to export metrics, logs, and traces to Google Cloud's observability services: Google Cloud Monitoring, Google Cloud Logging, and Google Cloud Trace.
Profile signal (Technology Preview):: This release introduces support for the Profile signal as a Technology Preview feature for receiving, processing, and exporting data in the Profile signal format. The Profile signal is a new observability data format for capturing the low-level performance of application code.
Prometheus Remote Write Receiver (Technology Preview):: This release introduces the Prometheus Remote Write Receiver as a Technology Preview feature for the Collector of the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry. You can use the Prometheus Remote Write Receiver to export metrics from the Prometheus server.


[IMPORTANT]

Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

# Fixed issues

Fixed BearerTokenAuth Extension errors:: Before this update, the BearerTokenAuth Extension might log errors when the service account token was refreshed. With this update, the extension correctly handles token file refresh without producing errors.

TRACING-5678
Fixed errors from the CA Injector of cert-manager:: Before this update, the CA Injector of cert-manager was logging errors related to fetching the certificates for the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator. With this update, the OpenTelemetry Collector no longer relies on cert-manager, preventing unnecessary error logs.

TRACING-5590
Fixed short-term token authentication for the AWS Cloud Watch Exporter:: Before this update, the AWS Cloud Watch Exporter ignored short-term token authentication using an Amazon Resource Name (ARN). With this update, the exporter correctly handles short-term token authentication.
