# Release notes for the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry



# Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry overview

Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry is based on the open source OpenTelemetry project, which aims to provide unified, standardized, and vendor-neutral telemetry data collection for cloud-native software. Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry product provides support for deploying and managing the OpenTelemetry Collector and simplifying the workload instrumentation.

The OpenTelemetry Collector can receive, process, and forward telemetry data in multiple formats, making it the ideal component for telemetry processing and interoperability between telemetry systems. The Collector provides a unified solution for collecting and processing metrics, traces, and logs.

The OpenTelemetry Collector has a number of features including the following:

Data Collection and Processing Hub:: It acts as a central component that gathers telemetry data like metrics and traces from various sources. This data can be created from instrumented applications and infrastructure.
Customizable telemetry data pipeline:: The OpenTelemetry Collector is designed to be customizable. It supports various processors, exporters, and receivers.
Auto-instrumentation features:: Automatic instrumentation simplifies the process of adding observability to applications. Developers do not need to manually instrument their code for basic telemetry data.

Here are some of the use cases for the OpenTelemetry Collector:

Centralized data collection:: In a microservices architecture, the Collector can be deployed to aggregate data from multiple services.
Data enrichment and processing:: Before forwarding data to analysis tools, the Collector can enrich, filter, and process this data.
Multi-backend receiving and exporting:: The Collector can receive and send data to multiple monitoring and analysis platforms simultaneously.

You can use the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry in combination with the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Tempo).

## New features and enhancements

This update introduces the following enhancement:

* Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry 3.2 is based on the open source OpenTelemetry release 0.100.0.

## Deprecated functionality

In Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry 3.2, use of empty values and null keywords in the OpenTelemetry Collector custom resource is deprecated and planned to be unsupported in a future release. Red Hat will provide bug fixes and support for this syntax during the current release lifecycle, but this syntax will become unsupported. As an alternative to empty values and null keywords, you can update the OpenTelemetry Collector custom resource to contain empty JSON objects as open-closed braces {} instead.

## Bug fixes

This update introduces the following bug fix:

* Before this update, the checkbox to enable Operator monitoring was not available in the web console when installing the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator. As a result, a ServiceMonitor resource was not created in the openshift-opentelemetry-operator namespace.

## Removal notice

In Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry 3.0, the Jaeger exporter has been removed. Bug fixes and support are provided only through the end of the 2.9 lifecycle. As an alternative to the Jaeger exporter for sending data to the Jaeger collector, you can use the OTLP exporter instead.

## Bug fixes

This update introduces the following bug fixes:

* Fixed support for disconnected environments when using the oc adm catalog mirror CLI command.

## Known issues

There is currently a known issue:

* Currently, the cluster monitoring of the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator is disabled due to a bug (TRACING-3761). The bug is preventing the cluster monitoring from scraping metrics from the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator due to a missing label openshift.io/cluster-monitoring=true that is required for the cluster monitoring and service monitor object.
Workaround

You can enable the cluster monitoring as follows:
1. Add the following label in the Operator namespace: oc label namespace openshift-opentelemetry-operator openshift.io/cluster-monitoring=true
2. Create a service monitor, role, and role binding:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor

Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry 2.0 is based on the open source OpenTelemetry release 0.33.0.

This release adds the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry as a Technology Preview, which you install using the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator. Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry is based on the OpenTelemetry APIs and instrumentation. The Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry includes the OpenTelemetry Operator and Collector. You can use the Collector to receive traces in the OpenTelemetry or Jaeger protocol and send the trace data to the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry. Other capabilities of the Collector are not supported at this time. The OpenTelemetry Collector allows developers to instrument their code with vendor agnostic APIs, avoiding vendor lock-in and enabling a growing ecosystem of observability tooling.

# Making open source more inclusive

Red Hat is committed to replacing problematic language in our code, documentation, and web properties. We are beginning with these four terms: master, slave, blacklist, and whitelist. Because of the enormity of this endeavor, these changes will be implemented gradually over several upcoming releases. For more details, see our CTO Chris Wright's message.
