# Configuring the instrumentation


The Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator uses an Instrumentation custom resource that defines the configuration of the instrumentation.

# Auto-instrumentation in the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator

Auto-instrumentation in the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator can automatically instrument an application without manual code changes. Developers and administrators can monitor applications with minimal effort and changes to the existing codebase.

Auto-instrumentation runs as follows:

1. The Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator injects an init-container, or a sidecar container for Go, to add the instrumentation libraries for the programming language of the instrumented application.
2. The Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator sets the required environment variables in the application's runtime environment. These variables configure the auto-instrumentation libraries to collect traces, metrics, and logs and send them to the appropriate OpenTelemetry Collector or another telemetry backend.
3. The injected libraries automatically instrument your application by connecting to known frameworks and libraries, such as web servers or database clients, to collect telemetry data. The source code of the instrumented application is not modified.
4. Once the application is running with the injected instrumentation, the application automatically generates telemetry data, which is sent to a designated OpenTelemetry Collector or an external OTLP endpoint for further processing.

Auto-instrumentation enables you to start collecting telemetry data quickly without having to manually integrate the OpenTelemetry SDK into your application code. However, some applications might require specific configurations or custom manual instrumentation.

# OpenTelemetry instrumentation configuration options

The Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry can inject and configure the OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation libraries into your workloads. Currently, the project supports injection of the instrumentation libraries from Go, Java, Node.js, Python, .NET, and the Apache HTTP Server (httpd).


[IMPORTANT]
----
The Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator only supports the injection mechanism of the instrumentation libraries but does not support instrumentation libraries or upstream images. Customers can build their own instrumentation images or use community images.
----

## Instrumentation options

Instrumentation options are specified in an Instrumentation custom resource (CR).


```yaml
apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1alpha1
kind: Instrumentation
metadata:
  name: instrumentation
spec:
  env:
    - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TIMEOUT
      value: "20"
  exporter:
    endpoint: http://production-collector.observability.svc.cluster.local:4317
  propagators:
    - tracecontext
    - baggage
  sampler:
    type: parentbased_traceidratio
    argument: "1"
  python: 1
    env: 2
      - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
        value: http://production-collector.observability.svc.cluster.local:4318
  dotnet: 3
    env: 4
      - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
        value: http://production-collector.observability.svc.cluster.local:4318
  go: 5
    env: 6
      - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
        value: http://production-collector.observability.svc.cluster.local:4318
```


Python auto-instrumentation uses protocol buffers over HTTP (HTTP/proto or HTTP/protobuf) by default.
Required if endpoint is set to :4317.
.NET auto-instrumentation uses protocol buffers over HTTP (HTTP/proto or HTTP/protobuf) by default.
Required if endpoint is set to :4317.
Go auto-instrumentation uses protocol buffers over HTTP (HTTP/proto or HTTP/protobuf) by default.
Required if endpoint is set to :4317.

For more information about procol buffers, see Overview (Protocol Buffers Documentation).





## Configuration of the OpenTelemetry SDK variables

You can use the instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-sdk annotation in the OpenTelemetry Collector custom resource to instruct the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator to inject some of the following OpenTelemetry SDK environment variables, depending on the Instrumentation CR, into your pod:

* OTEL_SERVICE_NAME
* OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER
* OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG
* OTEL_PROPAGATORS
* OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES
* OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
* OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_CERTIFICATE
* OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE
* OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_CLIENT_KEY



## Exporter configuration

Although the Instrumentation custom resource supports setting up one or more exporters per signal, auto-instrumentation configures only the OTLP Exporter. So you must configure the endpoint to point to the OTLP Receiver on the Collector.


```yaml
apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1alpha1
kind: Instrumentation
# ...
spec
# ...
  exporter:
    endpoint: https://production-collector.observability.svc.cluster.local:4317  1
    tls:
      configMapName: ca-bundle  2
      ca_file: service-ca.crt 3
# ...
```


Specifies the OTLP endpoint using the HTTPS scheme and TLS.
Specifies the name of the config map. The config map must already exist in the namespace of the pod injecting the auto-instrumentation.
Points to the CA certificate in the config map or the absolute path to the certificate if the certificate is already present in the workload file system.


```yaml
apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1alpha1
kind: Instrumentation
# ...
spec
# ...
  exporter:
    endpoint: https://production-collector.observability.svc.cluster.local:4317  1
    tls:
      secretName: serving-certs 2
      ca_file: service-ca.crt 3
      cert_file: tls.crt 4
      key_file: tls.key 5
# ...
```


Specifies the OTLP endpoint using the HTTPS scheme and TLS.
Specifies the name of the Secret for the ca_file, cert_file, and key_file values. The Secret must already exist in the namespace of the pod injecting the auto-instrumentation.
Points to the CA certificate in the Secret or the absolute path to the certificate if the certificate is already present in the workload file system.
Points to the client certificate in the Secret or the absolute path to the certificate if the certificate is already present in the workload file system.
Points to the client key in the Secret or the absolute path to a key if the key is already present in the workload file system.


[NOTE]
----
You can provide the CA certificate in a config map or Secret. If you provide it in both, the config map takes higher precedence than the Secret.
----


```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: otelcol-cabundle
  namespace: tutorial-application
  annotations:
    service.beta.openshift.io/inject-cabundle: "true"
# ...

apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1alpha1

metadata:
  name: my-instrumentation
spec:
  exporter:
    endpoint: https://simplest-collector.tracing-system.svc.cluster.local:4317
    tls:
      configMapName: otelcol-cabundle
      ca: service-ca.crt
# ...
```

For Python auto-instrumentation, the OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT environment variable must be set if the endpoint of the exporters is set to 4317. Python auto-instrumentation uses http/proto by default, and the telemetry data must be set to the 4318 port.


```yaml
instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-python: "true"
```


## Multi-container pods

The instrumentation is run on the first container that is available by default according to the pod specification. In some cases, you can also specify target containers for injection.


```yaml
instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/container-names: "<container_1>,<container_2>"
```



[NOTE]
----
The Go auto-instrumentation does not support multi-container auto-instrumentation injection.
----

## Multi-container pods with multiple instrumentations

Injecting instrumentation for an application language to one or more containers in a multi-container pod requires the following annotation:


```yaml
instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/<application_language>-container-names: "<container_1>,<container_2>" 1
```


You can inject instrumentation for only one language per container. For the list of supported <application_language> values, see the following table.



## Using the instrumentation CR with Service Mesh

When using the instrumentation custom resource (CR) with Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh, you must use the b3multi propagator.
