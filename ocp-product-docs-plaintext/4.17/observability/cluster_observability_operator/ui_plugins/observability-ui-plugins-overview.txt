# Observability UI plugins overview



[IMPORTANT]
----
The Cluster Observability Operator is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.

You can use the Cluster Observability Operator (COO) to install and manage UI plugins to enhance the observability capabilities of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.
The plugins extend the default functionality, providing new UI features for monitoring, troubleshooting, distributed tracing, and cluster logging.

# Dashboards

The dashboard UI plugin supports enhanced dashboards in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console at Observe &#8594; Dashboards.
You can add other Prometheus data sources from the cluster to the default dashboards, in addition to the in-cluster data source.
This results in a unified observability experience across different data sources.

For more information, see the dashboard UI plugin page.

# Troubleshooting

The troubleshooting panel UI plugin for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.16+ provides observability signal correlation, powered by the open source Korrel8r project.
You can use the troubleshooting panel available from the Observe &#8594; Alerting page to easily correlate metrics, logs, alerts, netflows, and additional observability signals and resources, across different data stores.
Users of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.17+ can also access the troubleshooting UI panel from the Application Launcher Application Launcher.

The output of Korrel8r is displayed as an interactive node graph. When you click on a node, you are automatically redirected to the corresponding web console page with the specific information for that node, for example, metric, log, or pod.

For more information, see the troubleshooting UI plugin page.

# Distributed tracing

The distributed tracing UI plugin adds tracing-related features to the web console on the Observe &#8594; Traces page.
You can follow requests through the front end and into the backend of microservices, helping you identify code errors and performance bottlenecks in distributed systems.
You can select a supported TempoStack or TempoMonolithic multi-tenant instance running in the cluster and set a time range and query to view the trace data.

For more information, see the distributed tracing UI plugin page.

# Cluster logging

The logging UI plugin surfaces logging data in the web console on the  Observe &#8594; Logs page.
You can specify filters, queries, time ranges and refresh rates. The results displayed a list of collapsed logs, which can then be expanded to show more detailed information for each log.

For more information, see the logging UI plugin page.
