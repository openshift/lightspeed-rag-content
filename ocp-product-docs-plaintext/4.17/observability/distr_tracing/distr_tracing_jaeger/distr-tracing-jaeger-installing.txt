# Installing



[WARNING]
----
The Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) 3.5 is the last release of the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) that Red Hat plans to support.
In the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform 3.5, Jaeger and support for Elasticsearch remain deprecated.
Support for the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) ends on November 3, 2025.
The Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform Operator (Jaeger) will be removed from the redhat-operators catalog on November 3, 2025. For more information, see the Red Hat Knowledgebase solution Jaeger Deprecation and Removal in OpenShift.
You must migrate to the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator and the Tempo Operator for distributed tracing collection and storage. For more information, see "Migrating" in the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry documentation, "Installing" in the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry documentation, and "Installing" in the distributed tracing platform (Tempo) documentation.
----
You can install Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform in either of two ways:
* You can install Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform as part of Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh. Distributed tracing is included by default in the Service Mesh installation. To install Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform as part of a service mesh, follow the Red Hat Service Mesh Installation instructions. You must install Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform in the same namespace as your service mesh, that is, the ServiceMeshControlPlane and the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform resources must be in the same namespace.
* If you do not want to install a service mesh, you can use the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform Operators to install distributed tracing platform by itself. To install Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform without a service mesh, use the following instructions.

# Prerequisites

Before you can install Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform, review the installation activities, and ensure that you meet the prerequisites:

* Possess an active Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform subscription on your Red Hat account. If you do not have a subscription, contact your sales representative for more information.
* Review the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.17 overview.
* Install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.17.
* Install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.17 on AWS
* Install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.17 on user-provisioned AWS
* Install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.17 on bare metal
* Install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.17 on vSphere
* Install the version of the oc CLI tool that matches your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version and add it to your path.
* An account with the cluster-admin role.

# Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform installation overview

The steps for installing Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform are as follows:

* Review the documentation and determine your deployment strategy.
* If your deployment strategy requires persistent storage, install the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator via the OperatorHub.
* Install the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator via the OperatorHub.
* Modify the custom resource YAML file to support your deployment strategy.
* Deploy one or more instances of Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) to your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform environment.

# Installing the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator

The default Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) deployment uses in-memory storage because it is designed to be installed quickly for those evaluating Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform, giving demonstrations, or using Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) in a test environment. If you plan to use Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) in production, you must install and configure a persistent storage option, in this case, Elasticsearch.

* You have access to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role. If you use Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated, you must have an account with the dedicated-admin role.


[WARNING]
----
Do not install Community versions of the Operators. Community Operators are not supported.
----


[NOTE]
----
If you have already installed the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator as part of OpenShift Logging, you do not need to install the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator again. The Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator creates the Elasticsearch instance using the installed OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator.
----

1. Log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console as a user with the cluster-admin role. If you use Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated, you must have an account with the dedicated-admin role.
2. Navigate to Operators -> OperatorHub.
3. Type Elasticsearch into the filter box to locate the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator.
4. Click the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator provided by Red Hat to display information about the Operator.
5. Click Install.
6. On the Install Operator page, select the stable Update Channel. This automatically updates your Operator as new versions are released.
7. Accept the default All namespaces on the cluster (default). This installs the Operator in the default openshift-operators-redhat project and makes the Operator available to all projects in the cluster.

[NOTE]
----
The Elasticsearch installation requires the openshift-operators-redhat namespace for the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator. The other Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform Operators are installed in the openshift-operators namespace.
----
8. Accept the default Automatic approval strategy. By accepting the default, when a new version of this Operator is available, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically upgrades the running instance of your Operator without human intervention. If you select Manual updates, when a newer version of an Operator is available, OLM creates an update request. As a cluster administrator, you must then manually approve that update request to have the Operator updated to the new version.

[NOTE]
----
The Manual approval strategy requires a user with appropriate credentials to approve the Operator install and subscription process.
----
9. Click Install.
10. On the Installed Operators page, select the openshift-operators-redhat project. Wait for the InstallSucceeded status of the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator before continuing.

# Installing the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform Operator

You can install the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform Operator through the OperatorHub.

By default, the Operator is installed in the openshift-operators project.

* You have access to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role. If you use Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated, you must have an account with the dedicated-admin role.
* If you require persistent storage, you must install the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator before installing the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform Operator.

1. Log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console as a user with the cluster-admin role. If you use Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated, you must have an account with the dedicated-admin role.
2. Navigate to Operators -> OperatorHub.
3. Search for the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform Operator by entering distributed tracing platform in the search field.
4. Select the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform Operator, which is provided by Red Hat, to display information about the Operator.

8. Accept the default Automatic approval strategy.

[NOTE]
----
If you accept this default, the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically upgrades the running instance of this Operator when a new version of the Operator becomes available.
If you select Manual updates, the OLM creates an update request when a new version of the Operator becomes available. To update the Operator to the new version, you must then manually approve the update request as a cluster administrator. The Manual approval strategy requires a cluster administrator to manually approve Operator installation and subscription.
