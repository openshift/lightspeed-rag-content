# Removing the distributed tracing platform



[TIP]
----
For information about removing the deprecated distributed tracing platform (Jaeger), see Removing in the distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) documentation.
----
The steps for removing the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Tempo) from an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster are as follows:
1. Shut down all distributed tracing platform (Tempo) pods.
2. Remove any TempoStack instances.
3. Remove the Tempo Operator.

# Removing by using the web console

You can remove a TempoStack instance in the Administrator view of the web console.

* You are logged in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console as a cluster administrator with the cluster-admin role.
* For Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated, you must be logged in using an account with the dedicated-admin role.

1. Go to Operators -> Installed Operators -> Tempo Operator -> TempoStack.
2. To remove the TempoStack instance, select . -> Delete TempoStack -> Delete.
3. Optional: Remove the Tempo Operator.

# Removing by using the CLI

You can remove a TempoStack instance on the command line.

* An active OpenShift CLI (`oc`) session by a cluster administrator with the cluster-admin role.

[TIP]
----
* Ensure that your OpenShift CLI (`oc`) version is up to date and matches your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version.
* Run oc login:

```terminal
$ oc login --username=<your_username>
```

----

1. Get the name of the TempoStack instance by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get deployments -n <project_of_tempostack_instance>
```

2. Remove the TempoStack instance by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete tempo <tempostack_instance_name> -n <project_of_tempostack_instance>
```

3. Optional: Remove the Tempo Operator.

1. Run the following command to verify that the TempoStack instance is not found in the output, which indicates its successful removal:

```terminal
$ oc get deployments -n <project_of_tempostack_instance>
```
