# Managing user-owned OAuth access tokens


Users can review their own OAuth access tokens and delete any that are no longer needed.

# Listing user-owned OAuth access tokens

You can list your user-owned OAuth access tokens. Token names are not sensitive and cannot be used to log in.

* List all user-owned OAuth access tokens:

```terminal
$ oc get useroauthaccesstokens
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME       CLIENT NAME                    CREATED                EXPIRES                         REDIRECT URI                                                       SCOPES
<token1>   openshift-challenging-client   2021-01-11T19:25:35Z   2021-01-12 19:25:35 +0000 UTC   https://oauth-openshift.apps.example.com/oauth/token/implicit      user:full
<token2>   openshift-browser-client       2021-01-11T19:27:06Z   2021-01-12 19:27:06 +0000 UTC   https://oauth-openshift.apps.example.com/oauth/token/display       user:full
<token3>   console                        2021-01-11T19:26:29Z   2021-01-12 19:26:29 +0000 UTC   https://console-openshift-console.apps.example.com/auth/callback   user:full
```

* List user-owned OAuth access tokens for a particular OAuth client:

```terminal
$ oc get useroauthaccesstokens --field-selector=clientName="console"
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME       CLIENT NAME                    CREATED                EXPIRES                         REDIRECT URI                                                       SCOPES
<token3>   console                        2021-01-11T19:26:29Z   2021-01-12 19:26:29 +0000 UTC   https://console-openshift-console.apps.example.com/auth/callback   user:full
```


# Viewing the details of a user-owned OAuth access token

You can view the details of a user-owned OAuth access token.

* Describe the details of a user-owned OAuth access token:

```terminal
$ oc describe useroauthaccesstokens <token_name>
```

Example output

The token name, which is the sha256 hash of the token. Token names are not sensitive and cannot be used to log in.
The client name, which describes where the token originated from.
The value in seconds from the creation time before this token expires.
If there is a token inactivity timeout set for the OAuth server, this is the value in seconds from the creation time before this token can no longer be used.
The scopes for this token.
The user name associated with this token.

# Deleting user-owned OAuth access tokens

The oc logout command only invalidates the OAuth token for the active session. You can use the following procedure to delete any user-owned OAuth tokens that are no longer needed.

Deleting an OAuth access token logs out the user from all sessions that use the token.

* Delete the user-owned OAuth access token:

```terminal
$ oc delete useroauthaccesstokens <token_name>
```

Example output

```terminal
useroauthaccesstoken.oauth.openshift.io "<token_name>" deleted
```


# Adding unauthenticated groups to cluster roles

As a cluster administrator, you can add unauthenticated users to the following cluster roles in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform by creating a cluster role binding. Unauthenticated users do not have access to non-public cluster roles. This should only be done in specific use cases when necessary.

You can add unauthenticated users to the following cluster roles:

* system:scope-impersonation
* system:webhook
* system:oauth-token-deleter
* self-access-reviewer


[IMPORTANT]
----
Always verify compliance with your organization's security standards when modifying unauthenticated access.
----

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Create a YAML file named add-<cluster_role>-unauth.yaml and add the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
 annotations:
   rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate: "true"
 name: <cluster_role>access-unauthenticated
roleRef:
 apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
 kind: ClusterRole
 name: <cluster_role>
subjects:
 - apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
   kind: Group
   name: system:unauthenticated
```

2. Apply the configuration by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f add-<cluster_role>.yaml
```
