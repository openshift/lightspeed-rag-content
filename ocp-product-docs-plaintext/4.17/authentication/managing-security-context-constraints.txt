# Managing security context constraints


In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, you can use security context constraints (SCCs) to control permissions for the pods in your cluster.
Default SCCs are created during installation and when you install some Operators or other components. As a cluster administrator, you can also create your own SCCs by using the OpenShift CLI (oc).

[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not modify the default SCCs. Customizing the default SCCs can lead to issues when some of the platform pods deploy or
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
is upgraded. Additionally, the default SCC values are reset to the defaults during some cluster upgrades, which discards all customizations to those SCCs.

# About security context constraints

Similar to the way that RBAC resources control user access, administrators can use security context constraints (SCCs) to control permissions for pods. These permissions determine the actions that a pod can perform and what resources it can access. You can use SCCs to define a set of conditions that a pod must run with to be accepted into the system.

Security context constraints allow an administrator to control:

* Whether a pod can run privileged containers with the allowPrivilegedContainer flag
* Whether a pod is constrained with the allowPrivilegeEscalation flag
* The capabilities that a container can request
* The use of host directories as volumes
* The SELinux context of the container
* The container user ID
* The use of host namespaces and networking
* The allocation of an FSGroup that owns the pod volumes
* The configuration of allowable supplemental groups
* Whether a container requires write access to its root file system
* The usage of volume types
* The configuration of allowable seccomp profiles


[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not set the openshift.io/run-level label on any namespaces in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. This label is for use by internal Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform components to manage the startup of major API groups, such as the Kubernetes API server and OpenShift API server. If the openshift.io/run-level label is set, no SCCs are applied to pods in that namespace, causing any workloads running in that namespace to be highly privileged.
----

## Default security context constraints

The cluster contains several default security context constraints (SCCs) as described in the table below. Additional SCCs might be installed when you install Operators or other components to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not modify the default SCCs. Customizing the default SCCs can lead to issues when some of the platform pods deploy or
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
is upgraded. Additionally, the default SCC values are reset to the defaults during some cluster upgrades, which discards all customizations to those SCCs.
----



## Security context constraints settings

Security context constraints (SCCs) are composed of settings and strategies that control the security features
a pod has access to. These settings fall into three categories:



CRI-O has the following default list of capabilities that are allowed for each container of a pod:

* CHOWN
* DAC_OVERRIDE
* FSETID
* FOWNER
* SETGID
* SETUID
* SETPCAP
* NET_BIND_SERVICE
* KILL

The containers use the capabilities from this default list, but pod manifest authors can alter the list by requesting additional capabilities or removing some of the default behaviors. Use the allowedCapabilities, defaultAddCapabilities, and requiredDropCapabilities parameters to control such requests from the pods. With these parameters you can specify which capabilities can be requested, which ones must be added to each container, and which ones must be forbidden, or dropped, from each container.


[NOTE]
----
You can drop all capabilites from containers by setting the requiredDropCapabilities parameter to ALL. This is what the restricted-v2 SCC does.
----

## Security context constraints strategies

* MustRunAs - Requires a runAsUser to be configured. Uses the configured
runAsUser as the default. Validates against the configured runAsUser.
Example MustRunAs snippet

```yaml
...
runAsUser:
  type: MustRunAs
  uid: <id>
...
```

* MustRunAsRange - Requires minimum and maximum values to be defined if not
using pre-allocated values. Uses the minimum as the default. Validates against
the entire allowable range.
Example MustRunAsRange snippet

```yaml
...
runAsUser:
  type: MustRunAsRange
  uidRangeMax: <maxvalue>
  uidRangeMin: <minvalue>
...
```

* MustRunAsNonRoot - Requires that the pod be submitted with a non-zero
runAsUser or have the USER directive defined in the image. No default
provided.
Example MustRunAsNonRoot snippet

```yaml
...
runAsUser:
  type: MustRunAsNonRoot
...
```

* RunAsAny - No default provided. Allows any runAsUser to be specified.
Example RunAsAny snippet

```yaml
...
runAsUser:
  type: RunAsAny
...
```


* MustRunAs - Requires seLinuxOptions to be configured if not using
pre-allocated values. Uses seLinuxOptions as the default. Validates against
seLinuxOptions.
* RunAsAny - No default provided. Allows any seLinuxOptions to be
specified.

* MustRunAs - Requires at least one range to be specified if not using
pre-allocated values. Uses the minimum value of the first range as the default.
Validates against all ranges.
* RunAsAny - No default provided. Allows any supplementalGroups to be
specified.

* MustRunAs - Requires at least one range to be specified if not using
pre-allocated values. Uses the minimum value of the first range as the default.
Validates against the first ID in the first range.
* RunAsAny - No default provided. Allows any fsGroup ID to be specified.

## Controlling volumes

The usage of specific volume types
can be controlled by setting the volumes
field of the SCC.

The allowable values of this field correspond to the volume
sources that are defined when creating a volume:

* awsElasticBlockStore
* azureDisk
* azureFile
* cephFS
* cinder
* configMap
* csi
* downwardAPI
* emptyDir
* fc
* flexVolume
* flocker
* gcePersistentDisk
* ephemeral
* gitRepo
* glusterfs
* hostPath
* iscsi
* nfs
* persistentVolumeClaim
* photonPersistentDisk
* portworxVolume
* projected
* quobyte
* rbd
* scaleIO
* secret
* storageos
* vsphereVolume
* * (A special value to allow the use of all volume types.)
* none (A special value to disallow the use of all volumes types. Exists only for backwards compatibility.)

The recommended minimum set of allowed volumes for new SCCs are configMap,
downwardAPI, emptyDir, persistentVolumeClaim, secret, and projected.


[NOTE]
----
This list of allowable volume types is not exhaustive because new types are
added with each release of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
----


[NOTE]
----
For backwards compatibility, the usage of allowHostDirVolumePlugin overrides
settings in the volumes field. For example, if allowHostDirVolumePlugin
is set to false but allowed in the volumes field, then the hostPath
value will be removed from volumes.
----

## Admission control

Admission control with SCCs allows for control over the creation of resources
based on the capabilities granted to a user.

In terms of the SCCs, this means that an admission controller can inspect the
user information made available in the context to retrieve an appropriate set of
SCCs. Doing so ensures the pod is authorized to make requests about its
operating environment or to generate a set of constraints to apply to the pod.

The set of SCCs that admission uses to authorize a pod are determined by the
user identity and groups that the user belongs to. Additionally, if the pod
specifies a service account, the set of allowable SCCs includes any constraints
accessible to the service account.


[NOTE]
----
When you create a workload resource, such as deployment, only the service account is used to find the SCCs and admit the pods when they are created.
----

Admission uses the following approach to create the final security context for
the pod:

1. Retrieve all SCCs available for use.
2. Generate field values for security context settings that were not specified
on the request.
3. Validate the final settings against the available constraints.

If a matching set of constraints is found, then the pod is accepted. If the
request cannot be matched to an SCC, the pod is rejected.

A pod must validate every field against the SCC. The following are examples for
just two of the fields that must be validated:


[NOTE]
----
These examples are in the context of a strategy using the pre-allocated values.
----

An FSGroup SCC strategy of MustRunAs

If the pod defines a fsGroup ID, then that ID must equal the default
fsGroup ID. Otherwise, the pod is not validated by that SCC and the next SCC
is evaluated.

If the SecurityContextConstraints.fsGroup field has value RunAsAny
and the pod specification omits the Pod.spec.securityContext.fsGroup,
then this field is considered valid. Note that it is possible that during
validation, other SCC settings will reject other pod fields and thus cause the
pod to fail.

A SupplementalGroups SCC strategy of MustRunAs

If the pod specification defines one or more supplementalGroups IDs, then
the pod&#8217;s IDs must equal one of the IDs in the namespace&#8217;s
openshift.io/sa.scc.supplemental-groups annotation. Otherwise, the pod is not
validated by that SCC and the next SCC is evaluated.

If the SecurityContextConstraints.supplementalGroups field has value RunAsAny
and the pod specification omits the Pod.spec.securityContext.supplementalGroups,
then this field is considered valid. Note that it is possible that during
validation, other SCC settings will reject other pod fields and thus cause the
pod to fail.

## Security context constraints prioritization

Security context constraints (SCCs) have a priority field that affects the ordering when attempting to validate a request by the admission controller.

A priority value of 0 is the lowest possible priority. A nil priority is considered a 0, or lowest, priority. Higher priority SCCs are moved to the front of the set when sorting.

When the complete set of available SCCs is determined, the SCCs are ordered in the following manner:

1. The highest priority SCCs are ordered first.
2. If the priorities are equal, the SCCs are sorted from most restrictive to least restrictive.
3. If both the priorities and restrictions are equal, the SCCs are sorted by name.

By default, the anyuid SCC granted to cluster administrators is given priority
in their SCC set. This allows cluster administrators to run pods as any
user by specifying RunAsUser in the pod&#8217;s SecurityContext.

# Example security context constraints

The following examples show the security context constraints (SCC) format and
annotations:


```yaml
allowHostDirVolumePlugin: true
allowHostIPC: true
allowHostNetwork: true
allowHostPID: true
allowHostPorts: true
allowPrivilegedContainer: true
allowedCapabilities: 1
- '*'
apiVersion: security.openshift.io/v1
defaultAddCapabilities: [] 2
fsGroup: 3
  type: RunAsAny
groups: 4
- system:cluster-admins
- system:nodes
kind: SecurityContextConstraints
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/description: 'privileged allows access to all privileged and host
      features and the ability to run as any user, any group, any fsGroup, and with
      any SELinux context.  WARNING: this is the most relaxed SCC and should be used
      only for cluster administration. Grant with caution.'
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: privileged
priority: null
readOnlyRootFilesystem: false
requiredDropCapabilities: 5

  type: RunAsAny
seccompProfiles:

supplementalGroups: 8
  type: RunAsAny
users: 9
- system:serviceaccount:default:registry
- system:serviceaccount:default:router
- system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:build-controller
volumes: 10
- '*'
```


A list of capabilities that a pod can request. An empty list means
that none of capabilities can be requested while the special symbol *
allows any capabilities.
A list of additional capabilities that are added to any pod.
The FSGroup strategy, which dictates the allowable values for the
security context.
The groups that can access this SCC.
A list of capabilities to drop from a pod. Or, specify ALL to drop all
capabilities.
The runAsUser strategy type, which dictates the allowable values for the
security context.
The seLinuxContext strategy type, which dictates the allowable values for
the security context.
The supplementalGroups strategy, which dictates the allowable supplemental
groups for the security context.
The users who can access this SCC.
The allowable volume types for the security context. In the example, * allows the use of all volume types.

The users and groups fields on the SCC control which users can access the
SCC.
By default, cluster administrators, nodes, and the build controller are granted
access to the privileged SCC. All authenticated users are granted access to the
restricted-v2 SCC.


```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: security-context-demo
spec:
  securityContext: 1
  containers:
  - name: sec-ctx-demo
    image: gcr.io/google-samples/node-hello:1.0
```


When a container or pod does not request a user ID under which it should be run,
the effective UID depends on the SCC that emits this pod. Because the restricted-v2 SCC
is granted to all authenticated users by default, it will be available to all
users and service accounts and used in most cases. The restricted-v2 SCC uses
MustRunAsRange strategy for constraining and defaulting the possible values of
the securityContext.runAsUser field. The admission plugin will look for the
openshift.io/sa.scc.uid-range annotation on the current project to populate
range fields, as it does not provide this range. In the end, a container will
have runAsUser equal to the first value of the range that is
hard to predict because every project has different ranges.


```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: security-context-demo
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 1000 1
  containers:
    - name: sec-ctx-demo
      image: gcr.io/google-samples/node-hello:1.0
```


A container or pod that requests a specific user ID will be accepted by
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform only when a service account or a user is granted access to a SCC
that allows such a user ID. The SCC can allow arbitrary IDs, an ID that falls
into a range, or the exact user ID specific to the request.

This configuration is valid for SELinux, fsGroup, and Supplemental Groups.

# Creating security context constraints

If the default security context constraints (SCCs) do not satisfy your application workload requirements, you can create a custom SCC by using the OpenShift CLI (oc).


[IMPORTANT]
----
Creating and modifying your own SCCs are advanced operations that might cause instability to your cluster. If you have questions about using your own SCCs, contact Red Hat Support. For information about contacting Red Hat support, see Getting support.
----

* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* Log in to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

1. Define the SCC in a YAML file named scc-admin.yaml:

```yaml
kind: SecurityContextConstraints
apiVersion: security.openshift.io/v1
metadata:
  name: scc-admin
allowPrivilegedContainer: true
runAsUser:
  type: RunAsAny
seLinuxContext:
  type: RunAsAny
fsGroup:
  type: RunAsAny
supplementalGroups:
  type: RunAsAny
users:
- my-admin-user
groups:
- my-admin-group
```


Optionally, you can drop specific capabilities for an SCC by setting the requiredDropCapabilities field with the desired values. Any specified capabilities are dropped from the container. To drop all capabilities, specify ALL. For example, to create an SCC that drops the KILL, MKNOD, and SYS_CHROOT capabilities, add the following to the SCC object:

```yaml
requiredDropCapabilities:
- KILL
- MKNOD
- SYS_CHROOT
```


[NOTE]
----
You cannot list a capability in both allowedCapabilities and requiredDropCapabilities.
----

CRI-O supports the same list of capability values that are found in the Docker documentation.
2. Create the SCC by passing in the file:

```terminal
$ oc create -f scc-admin.yaml
```

Example output

```terminal
securitycontextconstraints "scc-admin" created
```


* Verify that the SCC was created:

```terminal
$ oc get scc scc-admin
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME        PRIV      CAPS      SELINUX    RUNASUSER   FSGROUP    SUPGROUP   PRIORITY   READONLYROOTFS   VOLUMES
scc-admin   true      []        RunAsAny   RunAsAny    RunAsAny   RunAsAny   <none>     false            [awsElasticBlockStore azureDisk azureFile cephFS cinder configMap downwardAPI emptyDir fc flexVolume flocker gcePersistentDisk gitRepo glusterfs iscsi nfs persistentVolumeClaim photonPersistentDisk quobyte rbd secret vsphere]
```


# Configuring a workload to require a specific SCC

You can configure a workload to require a certain security context constraint (SCC). This is useful in scenarios where you want to pin a specific SCC to the workload or if you want to prevent your required SCC from being preempted by another SCC in the cluster.

To require a specific SCC, set the openshift.io/required-scc annotation on your workload. You can set this annotation on any resource that can set a pod manifest template, such as a deployment or daemon set.

The SCC must exist in the cluster and must be applicable to the workload, otherwise pod admission fails. An SCC is considered applicable to the workload if the user creating the pod or the pod&#8217;s service account has use permissions for the SCC in the pod&#8217;s namespace.


[WARNING]
----
Do not change the openshift.io/required-scc annotation in the live pod's manifest, because doing so causes the pod admission to fail. To change the required SCC, update the annotation in the underlying pod template, which causes the pod to be deleted and re-created.
----

* The SCC must exist in the cluster.

1. Create a YAML file for the deployment and specify a required SCC by setting the openshift.io/required-scc annotation:
Example deployment.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
spec:
# ...
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        openshift.io/required-scc: "my-scc" 1
# ...
```

Specify the name of the SCC to require.
2. Create the resource by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f deployment.yaml
```


* Verify that the deployment used the specified SCC:
1. View the value of the pod's openshift.io/scc annotation by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get pod <pod_name> -o jsonpath='{.metadata.annotations.openshift\.io\/scc}{"\n"}' 1
```

Replace <pod_name> with the name of your deployment pod.
2. Examine the output and confirm that the displayed SCC matches the SCC that you defined in the deployment:
Example output

```terminal
my-scc
```


# Role-based access to security context constraints

You can specify SCCs as resources that are handled by RBAC. This allows
you to scope access to your SCCs to a certain project or to the entire
cluster. Assigning users, groups, or service accounts directly to an
SCC retains cluster-wide scope.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not run workloads in or share access to default projects. Default projects are reserved for running core cluster components.
The following default projects are considered highly privileged: default, kube-public, kube-system, openshift, openshift-infra, openshift-node, and other system-created projects that have the openshift.io/run-level label set to 0 or 1. Functionality that relies on admission plugins, such as pod security admission, security context constraints, cluster resource quotas, and image reference resolution, does not work in highly privileged projects.
----

To include access to SCCs for your role, specify the scc resource
when creating a role.


```terminal
$ oc create role <role-name> --verb=use --resource=scc --resource-name=<scc-name> -n <namespace>
```


This results in the following role definition:


```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
...
  name: role-name 1
  namespace: namespace 2
...
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - security.openshift.io 3
  resourceNames:
  - scc-name 4
  resources:
  - securitycontextconstraints 5
  verbs: 6
  - use
```


The role's name.
Namespace of the defined role. Defaults to default if not specified.
The API group that includes the SecurityContextConstraints resource.
Automatically defined when scc is specified as a resource.
An example name for an SCC you want to have access.
Name of the resource group that allows users to specify SCC names in
the resourceNames field.
A list of verbs to apply to the role.

A local or cluster role with such a rule allows the subjects that are
bound to it with a role binding or a cluster role binding to use the
user-defined SCC called scc-name.


[NOTE]
----
Because RBAC is designed to prevent escalation, even project administrators
are unable to grant access to an SCC. By default, they are not
allowed to use the verb use on SCC resources, including the
restricted-v2 SCC.
----
