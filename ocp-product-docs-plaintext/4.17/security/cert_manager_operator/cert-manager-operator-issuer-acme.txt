# Configuring an ACME issuer


The cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift supports using Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) CA servers, such as Let's Encrypt, to issue certificates. Explicit credentials are configured by specifying the secret details in the Issuer API object. Ambient credentials are extracted from the environment, metadata services, or local files which are not explicitly configured in the Issuer API object.

[NOTE]
----
The Issuer object is namespace scoped. It can only issue certificates from the same namespace. You can also use the ClusterIssuer object to issue certificates across all namespaces in the cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: acme-cluster-issuer
spec:
  acme:
    ...
```

----

[NOTE]
----
By default, you can use the ClusterIssuer object with ambient credentials. To use the Issuer object with ambient credentials, you must enable the --issuer-ambient-credentials setting for the cert-manager controller.
----

# About ACME issuers

The ACME issuer type for the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift represents an Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) certificate authority (CA) server. ACME CA servers rely on a challenge to verify that a client owns the domain names that the certificate is being requested for. If the challenge is successful, the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift can issue the certificate. If the challenge fails, the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift does not issue the certificate.


[NOTE]
----
Private DNS zones are not supported with Let’s Encrypt and internet ACME servers.
----

## Supported ACME challenges types

The cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift supports the following challenge types for ACME issuers:

HTTP-01:: With the HTTP-01 challenge type, you provide a computed key at an HTTP URL endpoint in your domain. If the ACME CA server can get the key from the URL, it can validate you as the owner of the domain.

For more information, see HTTP01 in the upstream cert-manager documentation.


[NOTE]
----
HTTP-01 requires that the Let's Encrypt servers can access the route of the cluster. If an internal or private cluster is behind a proxy, the HTTP-01 validations for certificate issuance fail.
The HTTP-01 challenge is restricted to port 80. For more information, see HTTP-01 challenge (Let's Encrypt).
----

DNS-01:: With the DNS-01 challenge type, you provide a computed key at a DNS TXT record. If the ACME CA server can get the key by DNS lookup, it can validate you as the owner of the domain.

For more information, see DNS01 in the upstream cert-manager documentation.

## Supported DNS-01 providers

The cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift supports the following DNS-01 providers for ACME issuers:

* Amazon Route 53
* Azure DNS

[NOTE]
----
The cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift does not support using Microsoft Entra ID pod identities to assign a managed identity to a pod.
----
* Google Cloud Platform DNS
* Webhook
Red Hat tests and supports DNS providers using an external webhook with cert-manager on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. The following DNS providers are tested and supported with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform:
* cert-manager-webhook-ibmcis

[NOTE]
----
Using a DNS provider that is not listed might work with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, but the provider was not tested by Red Hat and therefore is not supported by Red Hat.
----

# Configuring an ACME issuer to solve HTTP-01 challenges

You can use cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift to set up an ACME issuer to solve HTTP-01 challenges. This procedure uses Let&#8217;s Encrypt as the ACME CA server.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You have a service that you want to expose. In this procedure, the service is named sample-workload.

1. Create an ACME cluster issuer.
1. Create a YAML file that defines the ClusterIssuer object:
Example acme-cluster-issuer.yaml file

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-staging                                        1
spec:
  acme:
    preferredChain: ""
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: <secret_for_private_key>                               2
    server: https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory 3
    solvers:
    - http01:
        ingress:
          ingressClassName: openshift-default                                 4
```

Provide a name for the cluster issuer.
Replace <secret_private_key> with the name of secret to store the ACME account private key in.
Specify the URL to access the ACME server's directory endpoint. This example uses the Let's Encrypt staging environment.
Specify the Ingress class.
2. Optional: If you create the object without specifying ingressClassName, use the following command to patch the existing ingress:

```terminal
$ oc patch ingress/<ingress-name> --type=merge --patch '{"spec":{"ingressClassName":"openshift-default"}}' -n <namespace>
```

3. Create the ClusterIssuer object by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f acme-cluster-issuer.yaml
```

2. Create an Ingress to expose the service of the user workload.
1. Create a YAML file that defines a Namespace object:
Example namespace.yaml file

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: my-ingress-namespace 1
```

Specify the namespace for the Ingress.
2. Create the Namespace object by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f namespace.yaml
```

3. Create a YAML file that defines the Ingress object:
Example ingress.yaml file

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: sample-ingress                                           1
  namespace: my-ingress-namespace                                2
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-staging          3
spec:
  ingressClassName: openshift-default                            4
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - <hostname>                                                 5
    secretName: sample-tls                                       6
  rules:
  - host: <hostname>                                             7
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: sample-workload                                8
            port:
              number: 80
```

Specify the name of the Ingress.
Specify the namespace that you created for the Ingress.
Specify the cluster issuer that you created.
Specify the Ingress class.
Replace <hostname> with the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) to be associated with the certificate. This name is used to add DNS names to the certificate.
Specify the secret that stores the certificate.
Replace <hostname> with the hostname. You can use the <host_name>.<cluster_ingress_domain> syntax to take advantage of the *.<cluster_ingress_domain> wildcard DNS record and serving certificate for the cluster. For example, you might use apps.<cluster_base_domain>. Otherwise, you must ensure that a DNS record exists for the chosen hostname.
Specify the name of the service to expose. This example uses a service named sample-workload.
4. Create the Ingress object by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f ingress.yaml
```


# Configuring an ACME issuer by using explicit credentials for AWS Route53

You can use cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift to set up an Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) issuer to solve DNS-01 challenges by using explicit credentials on AWS. This procedure uses Let&#8217;s Encrypt as the ACME certificate authority (CA) server and shows how to solve DNS-01 challenges with Amazon Route 53.

* You must provide the explicit accessKeyID and secretAccessKey credentials. For more information, see Route53 in the upstream cert-manager documentation.

[NOTE]

    -n my-issuer-namespace
```

Replace <aws_secret_access_key> with your AWS secret access key.
