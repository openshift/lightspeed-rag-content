# Creating and building an application using the CLI



# Before you begin

* Review About the OpenShift CLI.
* You must be able to access a running instance of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. If you do not have access, contact your cluster administrator.
* You must have the OpenShift CLI (oc) downloaded and installed.

# Logging in to the CLI

You can log in to the OpenShift CLI (oc) to access and manage your cluster.

* You must have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* You must have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

* Log into Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform from the CLI using your username and password, with an OAuth token, or with a web browser:
* With username and password:

```terminal
$ oc login -u=<username> -p=<password> --server=<your-openshift-server> --insecure-skip-tls-verify
```

* With an OAuth token:

```terminal
$ oc login <https://api.your-openshift-server.com> --token=<tokenID>
```

* With a web browser:

```terminal
$ oc login <cluster_url> --web
```


You can now create a project or issue other commands for managing your cluster.

* oc login
* oc logout

# Creating a new project

A project enables a community of users to organize and manage their content in isolation. Projects are Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform extensions to Kubernetes namespaces. Projects have additional features that enable user self-provisioning.

Users must receive access to projects from administrators. Cluster administrators can allow developers to create their own projects. In most cases, users automatically have access to their own projects.

Each project has its own set of objects, policies, constraints, and service accounts.

* You must have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* You must have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

* To create a new project, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc new-project user-getting-started --display-name="Getting Started with OpenShift"
```

Example output

```terminal
Now using project "user-getting-started" on server "https://openshift.example.com:6443".
```


* oc new-project

# Granting view permissions

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform automatically creates a few special service accounts in every project. The default service account takes responsibility for running the pods. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform uses and injects this service account into every pod that launches.

The following procedure creates a RoleBinding object for the default ServiceAccount object. The service account communicates with the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform API to learn about pods, services, and resources within the project.

* You must have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* You must have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have a deployed image.
* You must have cluster-admin or project-admin privileges.

* To add the view role to the default service account in the user-getting-started project, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user view -z default -n user-getting-started
```


* Understanding authentication
* RBAC overview
* oc policy add-role-to-user

# Deploying your first image

The simplest way to deploy an application in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is to run an existing container image. The following procedure deploys a front-end component of an application called national-parks-app. The web application displays an interactive map. The map displays the location of major national parks across the world.

* You must have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

* To deploy an application, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc new-app quay.io/openshiftroadshow/parksmap:latest --name=parksmap -l 'app=national-parks-app,component=parksmap,role=frontend,app.kubernetes.io/part-of=national-parks-app'
```

Example output

```text
--> Found container image 0c2f55f (12 months old) from quay.io for "quay.io/openshiftroadshow/parksmap:latest"

    * An image stream tag will be created as "parksmap:latest" that will track this image

--> Creating resources with label app=national-parks-app,app.kubernetes.io/part-of=national-parks-app,component=parksmap,role=frontend ...
    imagestream.image.openshift.io "parksmap" created
    deployment.apps "parksmap" created
    service "parksmap" created
--> Success
```


* oc new-app

## Creating a route

External clients can access applications running on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform through the routing layer and the data object behind that is a route. The default Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform router (HAProxy) uses the HTTP header of the incoming request to determine where to proxy the connection.

Optionally, you can define security, such as TLS, for the route.

* You must have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* You must have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have a deployed image.
* You must have cluster-admin or project-admin privileges.

1. To retrieve the created application service, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get service
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME      TYPE       CLUSTER-IP         EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)   AGE
parksmap  ClusterIP  <your-cluster-IP>  <123.456.789>  8080/TCP  8m29s
```

2. To create a route, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create route edge parksmap --service=parksmap
```

Example output

```terminal
route.route.openshift.io/parksmap created
```

3. To retrieve the created application route, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get route
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME        HOST/PORT                                                   PATH   SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
parksmap    parksmap-user-getting-started.apps.cluster.example.com             parksmap   8080-tcp   edge          None
```


* oc create route edge
* oc get

## Examining the pod

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform leverages the Kubernetes concept of a pod, which is one or more containers deployed together on one host, and the smallest compute unit that can be defined, deployed, and managed.
Pods are the rough equivalent of a machine instance, physical or virtual, to a container.

You can view the pods in your cluster and to determine the health of those pods and the cluster as a whole.

* You must have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* You must have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have a deployed image.

1. To list all pods with node names, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get pods
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
parksmap-5f9579955-6sng8   1/1     Running   0          77s
```

2. To list all pod details, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc describe pods
```

Example output

```terminal

## Scaling the application

In Kubernetes, a Deployment object defines how an application deploys. In most cases, users use Pod, Service, ReplicaSets, and Deployment resources together. In most cases, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform creates the resources for you.

When you deploy the national-parks-app image, a deployment resource is created.  In this example, only one Pod is deployed.

The following procedure scales the national-parks-image to use two instances.

* You must have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* You must have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have a deployed image.

* To scale your application from one pod instance to two pod instances, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc scale --current-replicas=1 --replicas=2 deployment/parksmap
```

Example output

```text
deployment.apps/parksmap scaled
```


1. To ensure that your application scaled properly, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get pods
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
parksmap-5f9579955-6sng8   1/1     Running   0          7m39s
parksmap-5f9579955-8tgft   1/1     Running   0          24s
```

2. To scale your application back down to one pod instance, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc scale --current-replicas=2 --replicas=1 deployment/parksmap
```


* oc scale

# Deploying a Python application

The following procedure deploys a back-end service for the parksmap application. The Python application performs 2D geo-spatial queries against a MongoDB database to locate and return map coordinates of all national parks in the world.

The deployed back-end service is nationalparks.

* You must have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* You must have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have a deployed image.

1. To create a new Python application, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc new-app python~https://github.com/openshift-roadshow/nationalparks-py.git --name nationalparks -l 'app=national-parks-app,component=nationalparks,role=backend,app.kubernetes.io/part-of=national-parks-app,app.kubernetes.io/name=python' --allow-missing-images=true
```

Example output

```

2. To create a route to expose your application, nationalparks, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create route edge nationalparks --service=nationalparks
```

Example output

```terminal

```


* oc new-app

# Connecting to a database

Deploy and connect a MongoDB database where the national-parks-app application stores location information.
Once you mark the national-parks-app application as a backend for the map visualization tool, parksmap deployment uses the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform discover mechanism to display the map automatically.

* You must have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* You must have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have a deployed image.

* To connect to a database, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc new-app quay.io/centos7/mongodb-36-centos7 --name mongodb-nationalparks -e MONGODB_USER=mongodb -e MONGODB_PASSWORD=mongodb -e MONGODB_DATABASE=mongodb -e MONGODB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=mongodb -l 'app.kubernetes.io/part-of=national-parks-app,app.kubernetes.io/name=mongodb'
```

## Creating a secret

The Secret object provides a mechanism to hold sensitive information such as passwords, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform client configuration files, private source repository credentials, and so on.
Secrets decouple sensitive content from the pods. You can mount secrets into containers using a volume plugin or the system can use secrets to perform actions on behalf of a pod.
The following procedure adds the secret nationalparks-mongodb-parameters and mounts it to the nationalparks workload.

* You must have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* You must have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have a deployed image.

1. To create a secret, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create secret generic nationalparks-mongodb-parameters --from-literal=DATABASE_SERVICE_NAME=mongodb-nationalparks --from-literal=MONGODB_USER=mongodb --from-literal=MONGODB_PASSWORD=mongodb --from-literal=MONGODB_DATABASE=mongodb --from-literal=MONGODB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=mongodb
```

Example output

```terminal
secret/nationalparks-mongodb-parameters created
```

2. To update the environment variable to attach the mongodb secret to the nationalpartks workload, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc set env --from=secret/nationalparks-mongodb-parameters deploy/nationalparks
```

Example output

```terminal
deployment.apps/nationalparks updated
```

3. To show the status of the nationalparks deployment, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc rollout status deployment nationalparks
```

Example output

```terminal
deployment "nationalparks" successfully rolled out
```

4. To show the status of the mongodb-nationalparks deployment, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc rollout status deployment mongodb-nationalparks
```

Example output

```terminal
deployment "nationalparks" successfully rolled out
deployment "mongodb-nationalparks" successfully rolled out
```


* oc create secret generic
* oc set env
* oc rollout status

## Loading data and displaying the national parks map

You deployed the parksmap and nationalparks applications and then deployed the mongodb-nationalparks database. However, no data has been loaded into the database.

* You must have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* You must have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have a deployed image.

1. To load national parks data, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc exec $(oc get pods -l component=nationalparks | tail -n 1 | awk '{print $1;}') -- curl -s http://localhost:8080/ws/data/load
```

Example output

```text
"Items inserted in database: 2893"
```

2. To verify that your data is loaded properly, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc exec $(oc get pods -l component=nationalparks | tail -n 1 | awk '{print $1;}') -- curl -s http://localhost:8080/ws/data/all
```

Example output (trimmed)

```terminal
, {"id": "Great Zimbabwe", "latitude": "-20.2674635", "longitude": "30.9337986", "name": "Great Zimbabwe"}]
```

3. To add labels to the route, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc label route nationalparks type=parksmap-backend
```

Example output

```terminal
route.route.openshift.io/nationalparks labeled
```

4. To retrieve your routes to view your map, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get routes
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME            HOST/PORT                                                      PATH   SERVICES        PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
