* RHSA-2024:3637

## New features and enhancements

* You can now install and use the Secondary Scheduler Operator in an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster running in FIPS mode.

[IMPORTANT]
----
To enable FIPS mode for your cluster, you must run the installation program from a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) computer configured to operate in FIPS mode. For more information about configuring FIPS mode on RHEL, see Switching RHEL to FIPS mode.
When running Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) booted in FIPS mode, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform core components use the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures.

## Bug fixes

* This release of the Secondary Scheduler Operator addresses several Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs).

## Known issues

* Currently, you cannot deploy additional resources, such as config maps, CRDs, or RBAC policies through the Secondary Scheduler Operator. Any resources other than roles and role bindings that are required by your custom secondary scheduler must be applied externally. (WRKLDS-645)
