# Release notes for Kube Descheduler Operator 5.1.3

Issued: 7 July 2025

The following advisory is available for the Kube Descheduler Operator 5.1.3:

* RHBA-2025:10386

## Bug fixes

* Previously, the relatedImages field was not set properly in the Kube Descheduler Operator cluster service version (CSV), so the images were not properly mirrored when using oc-mirror. With this release, the relatedImages field is now set properly and the Kube Descheduler Operator images are now mirrored properly when using oc-mirror. (OCPBUGS-56485)

# Release notes for Kube Descheduler Operator 5.1.2

Issued: 1 May 2025

The following advisory is available for the Kube Descheduler Operator 5.1.2:

* RHBA-2025:4334

## Bug fixes

* Previously, when the LifecycleAndUtilization profile was enabled, pods from protected namespaces (openshift-*, kube-system, hypershift) could be evicted. Pods in these namespaces should never be evicted. With this release, these protected namespaces are now properly excluded from eviction when the LifecycleAndUtilization profile is enabled. (OCPBUGS-54414)

* For the CompactAndScale profile, you can use the Technology Preview field devHighNodeUtilizationThresholds to adjust the underutilized threshold value.
