# Installing the custom metrics autoscaler


You can use the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console to install the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator.
The installation creates the following five CRDs:
* ClusterTriggerAuthentication
* KedaController
* ScaledJob
* ScaledObject
* TriggerAuthentication
The installation process also creates the KedaController custom resource (CR). You can modify the default KedaController CR, if needed. For more information, see "Editing the Keda Controller CR".

[NOTE]
----
If you are installing a Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator version lower than 2.17.2, you must manually create the Keda Controller CR. You can use the procedure described in "Editing the Keda Controller CR" to create the CR.

# Installing the custom metrics autoscaler

You can use the following procedure to install the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator.

* Remove any previously-installed Technology Preview versions of the Cluster Metrics Autoscaler Operator.
* Remove any versions of the community-based KEDA.

Also, remove the KEDA 1.x custom resource definitions by running the following commands:

```terminal
$ oc delete crd scaledobjects.keda.k8s.io
```


```terminal
$ oc delete crd triggerauthentications.keda.k8s.io
```

* Optional: If you need the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator to connect to off-cluster services, such as an external Kafka cluster or an external Prometheus service, put any required service CA certificates into a config map. The config map must exist in the same namespace where the Operator is installed. For example:

```terminal
$ oc create configmap -n openshift-keda thanos-cert  --from-file=ca-cert.pem
```


1. In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, click Operators -> OperatorHub.
2. Choose Custom Metrics Autoscaler from the list of available Operators, and click Install.
3. On the Install Operator page, ensure that the All namespaces on the cluster (default) option
is selected for Installation Mode. This installs the Operator in all namespaces.
4. Ensure that the openshift-keda namespace is selected for Installed Namespace. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform creates the namespace, if not present in your cluster.
5. Click Install.
6. Verify the installation by listing the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator components:
1. Navigate to Workloads -> Pods.
2. Select the openshift-keda project from the drop-down menu and verify that the custom-metrics-autoscaler-operator-* pod is running.
3. Navigate to Workloads -> Deployments to verify that the custom-metrics-autoscaler-operator deployment is running.
7. Optional: Verify the installation in the OpenShift CLI using the following commands:

```terminal
$ oc get all -n openshift-keda
```


The output appears similar to the following:
Example output

```terminal

# Editing the Keda Controller CR

You can use the following procedure to modify the KedaController custom resource (CR), which is automatically installed during the installation of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator.

1. In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, click Operators -> Installed Operators.
2. Click Custom Metrics Autoscaler.
3. On the Operator Details page, click the KedaController tab.
4. On the KedaController tab, click Create KedaController and edit the file.

```yaml

Specifies a single namespace in which the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator scales applications. Leave it blank or leave it empty to scale applications in all namespaces. This field should have a namespace or be empty. The default value is empty.
Specifies the level of verbosity for the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator log messages. The allowed values are debug, info, error. The default is info.
Specifies the logging format for the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator log messages. The allowed values are console or json. The default is console.
Optional: Specifies one or more config maps with CA certificates, which the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator can use to connect securely to TLS-enabled metrics sources.
Optional: Add the container mount path.
Optional: Add a volumes block to list each projected volume source.
Specifies the logging level for the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Metrics Server. The allowed values are 0 for info and 4 for debug. The default is 0.
Activates audit logging for the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator and specifies the audit policy to use, as described in the "Configuring audit logging" section.
