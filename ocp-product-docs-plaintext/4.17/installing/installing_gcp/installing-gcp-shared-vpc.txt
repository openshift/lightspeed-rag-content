# Installing a cluster on GCP into a shared VPC


In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.17, you can install a cluster into a shared Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). In this installation method, the cluster is configured to use a VPC from a different GCP project. A shared VPC enables an organization to connect resources from multiple projects to a common VPC network. You can communicate within the organization securely and efficiently by using internal IP addresses from that network. For more information about shared VPC, see Shared VPC overview in the GCP documentation.
The installation program provisions the rest of the required infrastructure, which you can further customize. To customize the installation, you modify parameters in the install-config.yaml file before you install the cluster.

# Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation and update processes.
* You read the documentation on selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users.
* If you use a firewall, you configured it to allow the sites that your cluster requires access to.
* You configured a GCP project to host the cluster. This project, known as the service project, must be attached to the host project. For more information, see Attaching service projects in the GCP documentation.
* You have a GCP service account that has the required GCP permissions in both the host and service projects.
* You have a GCP host project that contains a shared VPC network and that has a configured Cloud Router and Cloud NAT gateway, to ensure that internet access from the VPC is available. For more information, see Cloud Router overview and  Cloud NAT overview (Google documentation).

# Internet access for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.17, you require access to the internet to
install
your cluster.

You must have internet access to:

* Access OpenShift Cluster Manager to download the installation program and perform subscription management. If the cluster has internet access and you do not disable Telemetry, that service automatically entitles your cluster.
* Access Quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install your cluster.
* Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.

# Generating a key pair for cluster node SSH access

During an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation, you can provide an SSH public key to the installation program. The key is passed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) nodes through their Ignition config files and is used to authenticate SSH access to the nodes. The key is added to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys list for the core user on each node, which enables password-less authentication.

After the key is passed to the nodes, you can use the key pair to SSH in to the RHCOS nodes as the user core. To access the nodes through SSH, the private key identity must be managed by SSH for your local user.

If you want to SSH in to your cluster nodes to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, you must provide the SSH public key during the installation process. The ./openshift-install gather command also requires the SSH public key to be in place on the cluster nodes.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not skip this procedure in production environments, where disaster recovery and debugging is required.
----


[NOTE]
----
You must use a local key, not one that you configured with platform-specific
approaches such as
AWS key pairs.
----

1. If you do not have an existing SSH key pair on your local machine to use for authentication onto your cluster nodes, create one. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

```terminal
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N '' -f <path>/<file_name> 1
```

Specify the path and file name, such as ~/.ssh/id_ed25519, of the new SSH key. If you have an existing key pair, ensure your public key is in the your ~/.ssh directory.

[NOTE]
----
If you plan to install an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster that uses the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures, do not create a key that uses the ed25519 algorithm. Instead, create a key that uses the rsa or ecdsa algorithm.
----
2. View the public SSH key:

```terminal
$ cat <path>/<file_name>.pub
```


For example, run the following to view the ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub public key:

```terminal
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

3. Add the SSH private key identity to the SSH agent for your local user, if it has not already been added. SSH agent management of the key is required for password-less SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes, or if you want to use the ./openshift-install gather command.

[NOTE]
----
On some distributions, default SSH private key identities such as ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_dsa are managed automatically.
----
1. If the ssh-agent process is not already running for your local user, start it as a background task:

```terminal
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

Example output

```terminal
Agent pid 31874
```


[NOTE]
----
If your cluster is in FIPS mode, only use FIPS-compliant algorithms to generate the SSH key. The key must be either RSA or ECDSA.
----
4. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent:

```terminal
$ ssh-add <path>/<file_name> 1
```

Specify the path and file name for your SSH private key, such as ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
Example output

```terminal
Identity added: /home/<you>/<path>/<file_name> (<computer_name>)
```


* When you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, provide the SSH public key to the installation program.

# Obtaining the installation program

Before you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, download the installation file on
 the host you are using for installation.

* You have a computer that runs Linux or macOS, with 500 MB of local disk space.

1. Go to the Cluster Type page on the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console. If you have a Red Hat account, log in with your credentials. If you do not, create an account.

[TIP]
----
You can also download the binaries for a specific Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release.
----
2. Select your infrastructure provider from the Run it yourself section of the page.
3. Select your host operating system and architecture from the dropdown menus under OpenShift Installer and click Download Installer.
4. Place the downloaded file in the directory where you want to store the installation configuration files.

[IMPORTANT]
----
* The installation program creates several files on the computer that you use to install your cluster. You must keep the installation program and the files that the installation program creates after you finish installing the cluster. Both of the files are required to delete the cluster.
* Deleting the files created by the installation program does not remove your cluster, even if the cluster failed during installation. To remove your cluster, complete the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform uninstallation procedures for your specific cloud provider.
----
5. Extract the installation program. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

```terminal
$ tar -xvf openshift-install-linux.tar.gz
```

6. Download your installation pull secret from Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager. This pull secret allows you to authenticate with the services that are provided by the included authorities, including Quay.io, which serves the container images for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform components.


[TIP]
----
Alternatively, you can retrieve the installation program from the Red Hat Customer Portal, where you can specify a version of the installation program to download.
However, you must have an active subscription to access this page.
----

# Creating the installation files for GCP

To install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on {cp-first} ({cp}) into a shared VPC, you must generate the install-config.yaml file and modify it so that the cluster uses the correct VPC networks, DNS zones, and project names.

## Manually creating the installation configuration file

Installing the cluster requires that you manually create the installation configuration file.

* You have an SSH public key on your local machine to provide to the installation program. The key will be used for SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes for debugging and disaster recovery.
* You have obtained the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your
cluster.

1. Create an installation directory to store your required installation assets in:

```terminal
$ mkdir <installation_directory>
```


[IMPORTANT]
----
You must create a directory. Some installation assets, like bootstrap X.509
certificates have short expiration intervals, so you must not reuse an
installation directory. If you want to reuse individual files from another
cluster installation, you can copy them into your directory. However, the file
names for the installation assets might change between releases. Use caution
when copying installation files from an earlier Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version.
----
2. Customize the sample install-config.yaml file template that is provided and save
it in the <installation_directory>.

[NOTE]
----
You must name this configuration file install-config.yaml.
----
3. Back up the install-config.yaml file so that you can use it to install multiple clusters.

[IMPORTANT]
----
The install-config.yaml file is consumed during the next step of the installation process. You must back it up now.
----

* Installation configuration parameters for GCP

## Enabling Shielded VMs

You can use Shielded VMs when installing your cluster. Shielded VMs have extra security features including secure boot, firmware and integrity monitoring, and rootkit detection. For more information, see Google&#8217;s documentation on Shielded VMs.


[NOTE]
----
Shielded VMs are currently not supported on clusters with 64-bit ARM infrastructures.
----

* Use a text editor to edit the install-config.yaml file prior to deploying your cluster and add one of the following stanzas:
1. To use shielded VMs for only control plane machines:

```yaml
controlPlane:
  platform:
    gcp:
       secureBoot: Enabled
```

2. To use shielded VMs for only compute machines:

```yaml
compute:
- platform:
    gcp:
       secureBoot: Enabled
```

3. To use shielded VMs for all machines:

```yaml
platform:
  gcp:
    defaultMachinePlatform:
       secureBoot: Enabled
```


## Enabling Confidential VMs

You can use Confidential VMs when installing your cluster. Confidential VMs encrypt data while it is being processed. For more information, see Google&#8217;s documentation on Confidential Computing. You can enable Confidential VMs and Shielded VMs at the same time, although they are not dependent on each other.


[NOTE]
----
Confidential VMs are currently not supported on 64-bit ARM architectures.
----

* Use a text editor to edit the install-config.yaml file prior to deploying your cluster and add one of the following stanzas:
1. To use confidential VMs for only control plane machines:

```yaml
controlPlane:
  platform:
    gcp:
       confidentialCompute: Enabled 1
       type: n2d-standard-8 2
       onHostMaintenance: Terminate 3
```

Enable confidential VMs.
Specify a machine type that supports Confidential VMs. Confidential VMs require the N2D or C2D series of machine types. For more information on supported machine types, see Supported operating systems and machine types.
Specify the behavior of the VM during a host maintenance event, such as a hardware or software update. For a machine that uses Confidential VM, this value must be set to Terminate, which stops the VM. Confidential VMs do not support live VM migration.
2. To use confidential VMs for only compute machines:

```yaml
compute:
- platform:
    gcp:
       confidentialCompute: Enabled
       type: n2d-standard-8
       onHostMaintenance: Terminate
```

3. To use confidential VMs for all machines:

```yaml
platform:
  gcp:
    defaultMachinePlatform:
       confidentialCompute: Enabled
       type: n2d-standard-8
       onHostMaintenance: Terminate
```


## Sample customized install-config.yaml file for shared VPC installation

There are several configuration parameters which are required to install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on GCP using a shared VPC. The following is a sample install-config.yaml file which demonstrates these fields.


[IMPORTANT]
----
This sample YAML file is provided for reference only. You must modify this file with the correct values for your environment and cluster.
----


```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
credentialsMode: Passthrough 1
metadata:
  name: cluster_name
platform:
  gcp:
    computeSubnet: shared-vpc-subnet-1 2
    controlPlaneSubnet: shared-vpc-subnet-2 3
    network: shared-vpc 4
    networkProjectID: host-project-name 5
    projectID: service-project-name 6
    region: us-east1
    defaultMachinePlatform:
      tags: 7
      - global-tag1
controlPlane:
  name: master
  platform:
    gcp:
      tags: 7
      - control-plane-tag1
      type: n2-standard-4
      zones:
      - us-central1-a
      - us-central1-c
  replicas: 3
compute:
- name: worker
  platform:
    gcp:
      tags: 7
      - compute-tag1
      type: n2-standard-4
      zones:
      - us-central1-a
      - us-central1-c
  replicas: 3
networking:
  clusterNetwork:
  - cidr: 10.128.0.0/14
    hostPrefix: 23
  machineNetwork:
  - cidr: 10.0.0.0/16
pullSecret: '{"auths": ...}'
sshKey: ssh-ed25519 AAAA... 8
```


credentialsMode must be set to Passthrough or Manual. See the "Prerequisites" section for the required GCP permissions that your service account must have.
The name of the subnet in the shared VPC for compute machines to use.
The name of the subnet in the shared VPC for control plane machines to use.
The name of the shared VPC.
The name of the host project where the shared VPC exists.
The name of the GCP project where you want to install the cluster.
Optional. One or more network tags to apply to compute machines, control plane machines, or all machines.
You can optionally provide the sshKey value that you use to access the machines in your cluster.

## Configuring the cluster-wide proxy during installation

Production environments can deny direct access to the internet and instead have
an HTTP or HTTPS proxy available. You can configure a new Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
cluster to use a proxy by configuring the proxy settings in the
install-config.yaml file.

* You have an existing install-config.yaml file.
* You reviewed the sites that your cluster requires access to and determined whether any of them need to bypass the proxy. By default, all cluster egress traffic is proxied, including calls to hosting cloud provider APIs. You added sites to the Proxy object's spec.noProxy field to bypass the proxy if necessary.

[NOTE]
----
The Proxy object status.noProxy field is populated with the values of the networking.machineNetwork[].cidr, networking.clusterNetwork[].cidr, and networking.serviceNetwork[] fields from your installation configuration.
For installations on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, and Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP), the Proxy object status.noProxy field is also populated with the instance metadata endpoint (169.254.169.254).
----

1. Edit your install-config.yaml file and add the proxy settings. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: my.domain.com
proxy:
  httpProxy: http://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port> 1
  httpsProxy: https://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port> 2
  noProxy: example.com 3
additionalTrustBundle: | 4
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    <MY_TRUSTED_CA_CERT>
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
additionalTrustBundlePolicy: <policy_to_add_additionalTrustBundle> 5
```

A proxy URL to use for creating HTTP connections outside the cluster. The
URL scheme must be http.
A proxy URL to use for creating HTTPS connections outside the cluster.
A comma-separated list of destination domain names, IP addresses, or other network CIDRs to exclude from proxying. Preface a domain with . to match subdomains only. For example, .y.com matches x.y.com, but not y.com. Use * to bypass the proxy for all destinations.
If provided, the installation program generates a config map that is named user-ca-bundle in
the openshift-config namespace that contains one or more additional CA
certificates that are required for proxying HTTPS connections. The Cluster Network
Operator then creates a trusted-ca-bundle config map that merges these contents
with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) trust bundle, and this config map is referenced in the trustedCA field of the Proxy object. The additionalTrustBundle field is required unless
the proxy's identity certificate is signed by an authority from the RHCOS trust
bundle.
Optional: The policy to determine the configuration of the Proxy object to reference the user-ca-bundle config map in the trustedCA field. The allowed values are Proxyonly and Always. Use Proxyonly to reference the user-ca-bundle config map only when http/https proxy is configured. Use Always to always reference the user-ca-bundle config map. The default value is Proxyonly.

[NOTE]
----
The installation program does not support the proxy readinessEndpoints field.
----

[NOTE]
----
If the installer times out, restart and then complete the deployment by using the wait-for command of the installer. For example:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install wait-for install-complete --log-level debug
```

----
2. Save the file and reference it when installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

The installation program creates a cluster-wide proxy that is named cluster that uses the proxy
settings in the provided install-config.yaml file. If no proxy settings are
provided, a cluster Proxy object is still created, but it will have a nil
spec.


[NOTE]
----
Only the Proxy object named cluster is supported, and no additional
proxies can be created.
----

# Installing the OpenShift CLI

# Alternatives to storing administrator-level secrets in the kube-system project

By default, administrator secrets are stored in the kube-system project. If you configured the credentialsMode parameter in the install-config.yaml file to Manual, you must use one of the following alternatives:

* To manage long-term cloud credentials manually, follow the procedure in Manually creating long-term credentials.
* To implement short-term credentials that are managed outside the cluster for individual components, follow the procedures in Configuring a GCP cluster to use short-term credentials.

## Manually creating long-term credentials

The Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) can be put into manual mode prior to installation in environments where the cloud identity and access management (IAM) APIs are not reachable, or the administrator prefers not to store an administrator-level credential secret in the cluster kube-system namespace.

1. Add the following granular permissions to the GCP account that the installation program uses:
Required GCP permissions
* compute.machineTypes.list
* compute.regions.list
* compute.zones.list
* dns.changes.create
* dns.changes.get
* dns.managedZones.create
* dns.managedZones.delete
* dns.managedZones.get
* dns.managedZones.list
* dns.networks.bindPrivateDNSZone
* dns.resourceRecordSets.create
* dns.resourceRecordSets.delete
* dns.resourceRecordSets.list
2. If you did not set the credentialsMode parameter in the install-config.yaml configuration file to Manual, modify the value as shown:
Sample configuration file snippet

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
credentialsMode: Manual
# ...
```

3. If you have not previously created installation manifest files, do so by running the following command:

```terminal
$ openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory>
```


where <installation_directory> is the directory in which the installation program creates files.
4. Set a $RELEASE_IMAGE variable with the release image from your installation file by running the following command:

```terminal
$ RELEASE_IMAGE=$(./openshift-install version | awk '/release image/ {print $3}')
```

5. Extract the list of CredentialsRequest custom resources (CRs) from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc adm release extract \
  --from=$RELEASE_IMAGE \
  --credentials-requests \
  --included \1
  --install-config=<path_to_directory_with_installation_configuration>/install-config.yaml \2
  --to=<path_to_directory_for_credentials_requests> 3
```

The --included parameter includes only the manifests that your specific cluster configuration requires.
Specify the location of the install-config.yaml file.
Specify the path to the directory where you want to store the CredentialsRequest objects. If the specified directory does not exist, this command creates it.

This command creates a YAML file for each CredentialsRequest object.
Sample CredentialsRequest object

```yaml
apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
kind: CredentialsRequest
metadata:
  name: <component_credentials_request>
  namespace: openshift-cloud-credential-operator
  ...
spec:
  providerSpec:
    apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
    kind: GCPProviderSpec
    predefinedRoles:
    - roles/storage.admin
    - roles/iam.serviceAccountUser
    skipServiceCheck: true
  ...
```

6. Create YAML files for secrets in the openshift-install manifests directory that you generated previously. The secrets must be stored using the namespace and secret name defined in the spec.secretRef for each CredentialsRequest object.
Sample CredentialsRequest object with secrets

```yaml
apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
kind: CredentialsRequest
metadata:
  name: <component_credentials_request>
  namespace: openshift-cloud-credential-operator
  ...
spec:
  providerSpec:
    apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
      ...
  secretRef:
    name: <component_secret>
    namespace: <component_namespace>
  ...
```

Sample Secret object

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: <component_secret>
  namespace: <component_namespace>
data:
  service_account.json: <base64_encoded_gcp_service_account_file>
```



[IMPORTANT]
----
Before upgrading a cluster that uses manually maintained credentials, you must ensure that the CCO is in an upgradeable state.
----

## Configuring a GCP cluster to use short-term credentials

To install a cluster that is configured to use GCP Workload Identity, you must configure the CCO utility and create the required GCP resources for your cluster.

### Configuring the Cloud Credential Operator utility

To create and manage cloud credentials from outside of the cluster when the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) is operating in manual mode, extract and prepare the CCO utility (ccoctl) binary.


[NOTE]
----
The ccoctl utility is a Linux binary that must run in a Linux environment.
----

* You have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform account with cluster administrator access.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have added one of the following authentication options to the GCP account that the installation program uses:
* The IAM Workload Identity Pool Admin role.
* The following granular permissions:
Required GCP permissions
* compute.projects.get
* iam.googleapis.com/workloadIdentityPoolProviders.create
* iam.googleapis.com/workloadIdentityPoolProviders.get
* iam.googleapis.com/workloadIdentityPools.create
* iam.googleapis.com/workloadIdentityPools.delete
* iam.googleapis.com/workloadIdentityPools.get
* iam.googleapis.com/workloadIdentityPools.undelete
* iam.roles.create
* iam.roles.delete
* iam.roles.list
* iam.roles.undelete
* iam.roles.update
* iam.serviceAccounts.create
* iam.serviceAccounts.delete
* iam.serviceAccounts.getIamPolicy
* iam.serviceAccounts.list
* iam.serviceAccounts.setIamPolicy
* iam.workloadIdentityPoolProviders.get
* iam.workloadIdentityPools.delete
* resourcemanager.projects.get
* resourcemanager.projects.getIamPolicy
* resourcemanager.projects.setIamPolicy
* storage.buckets.create
* storage.buckets.delete
* storage.buckets.get
* storage.buckets.getIamPolicy
* storage.buckets.setIamPolicy
* storage.objects.create
* storage.objects.delete
* storage.objects.list

1. Set a variable for the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:

```terminal
$ RELEASE_IMAGE=$(./openshift-install version | awk '/release image/ {print $3}')
```

2. Obtain the CCO container image from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:

```terminal
$ CCO_IMAGE=$(oc adm release info --image-for='cloud-credential-operator' $RELEASE_IMAGE -a ~/.pull-secret)
```


[NOTE]
----
Ensure that the architecture of the $RELEASE_IMAGE matches the architecture of the environment in which you will use the ccoctl tool.
----
3. Extract the ccoctl binary from the CCO container image within the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc image extract $CCO_IMAGE \
  --file="/usr/bin/ccoctl.<rhel_version>" \1
  -a ~/.pull-secret
```

For <rhel_version>, specify the value that corresponds to the version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) that the host uses.
If no value is specified, ccoctl.rhel8 is used by default.
The following values are valid:
* rhel8: Specify this value for hosts that use RHEL 8.
* rhel9: Specify this value for hosts that use RHEL 9.
4. Change the permissions to make ccoctl executable by running the following command:

```terminal
$ chmod 775 ccoctl.<rhel_version>
```


* To verify that ccoctl is ready to use, display the help file. Use a relative file name when you run the command, for example:

```terminal
$ ./ccoctl.rhel9
```

Example output

```terminal
OpenShift credentials provisioning tool

Usage:
  ccoctl [command]

Available Commands:
  aws          Manage credentials objects for AWS cloud
  azure        Manage credentials objects for Azure
  gcp          Manage credentials objects for Google cloud
  help         Help about any command
  ibmcloud     Manage credentials objects for {ibm-cloud-title}
  nutanix      Manage credentials objects for Nutanix

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for ccoctl

Use "ccoctl [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```


### Creating GCP resources with the Cloud Credential Operator utility

You can use the ccoctl gcp create-all command to automate the creation of GCP resources.


[NOTE]
----
By default, ccoctl creates objects in the directory in which the commands are run. To create the objects in a different directory, use the --output-dir flag. This procedure uses <path_to_ccoctl_output_dir> to refer to this directory.
----

You must have:

* Extracted and prepared the ccoctl binary.

1. Set a $RELEASE_IMAGE variable with the release image from your installation file by running the following command:

```terminal
$ RELEASE_IMAGE=$(./openshift-install version | awk '/release image/ {print $3}')
```

2. Extract the list of CredentialsRequest objects from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc adm release extract \
  --from=$RELEASE_IMAGE \
  --credentials-requests \
  --included \1
  --install-config=<path_to_directory_with_installation_configuration>/install-config.yaml \2
  --to=<path_to_directory_for_credentials_requests> 3
```

The --included parameter includes only the manifests that your specific cluster configuration requires.
Specify the location of the install-config.yaml file.
Specify the path to the directory where you want to store the CredentialsRequest objects. If the specified directory does not exist, this command creates it.

[NOTE]
----
This command might take a few moments to run.
----
3. Use the ccoctl tool to process all CredentialsRequest objects by running the following command:

```terminal
$ ccoctl gcp create-all \
  --name=<name> \1
  --region=<gcp_region> \2
  --project=<gcp_project_id> \3
  --credentials-requests-dir=<path_to_credentials_requests_directory> 4
```

Specify the user-defined name for all created GCP resources used for tracking.
Specify the GCP region in which cloud resources will be created.
Specify the GCP project ID in which cloud resources will be created.
Specify the directory containing the files of CredentialsRequest manifests to create GCP service accounts.

[NOTE]
----
If your cluster uses Technology Preview features that are enabled by the TechPreviewNoUpgrade feature set, you must include the --enable-tech-preview parameter.
----

* To verify that the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform secrets are created, list the files in the <path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/manifests directory:

```terminal
$ ls <path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/manifests
```

Example output

```text
cluster-authentication-02-config.yaml
openshift-cloud-controller-manager-gcp-ccm-cloud-credentials-credentials.yaml
openshift-cloud-credential-operator-cloud-credential-operator-gcp-ro-creds-credentials.yaml
openshift-cloud-network-config-controller-cloud-credentials-credentials.yaml
openshift-cluster-api-capg-manager-bootstrap-credentials-credentials.yaml
openshift-cluster-csi-drivers-gcp-pd-cloud-credentials-credentials.yaml
openshift-image-registry-installer-cloud-credentials-credentials.yaml
openshift-ingress-operator-cloud-credentials-credentials.yaml
openshift-machine-api-gcp-cloud-credentials-credentials.yaml
```


You can verify that the IAM service accounts are created by querying GCP. For more information, refer to GCP documentation on listing IAM service accounts.

### Incorporating the Cloud Credential Operator utility manifests

To implement short-term security credentials managed outside the cluster for individual components, you must move the manifest files that the Cloud Credential Operator utility (ccoctl) created to the correct directories for the installation program.

* You have configured an account with the cloud platform that hosts your cluster.
* You have configured the Cloud Credential Operator utility (ccoctl).
* You have created the cloud provider resources that are required for your cluster with the ccoctl utility.

1. Add the following granular permissions to the GCP account that the installation program uses:
Required GCP permissions
* compute.machineTypes.list
* compute.regions.list
* compute.zones.list
* dns.changes.create
* dns.changes.get
* dns.managedZones.create
* dns.managedZones.delete
* dns.managedZones.get
* dns.managedZones.list
* dns.networks.bindPrivateDNSZone
* dns.resourceRecordSets.create
* dns.resourceRecordSets.delete
* dns.resourceRecordSets.list
2. If you did not set the credentialsMode parameter in the install-config.yaml configuration file to Manual, modify the value as shown:
Sample configuration file snippet

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
credentialsMode: Manual
# ...
```

3. If you have not previously created installation manifest files, do so by running the following command:

```terminal
$ openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory>
```


where <installation_directory> is the directory in which the installation program creates files.
4. Copy the manifests that the ccoctl utility generated to the manifests directory that the installation program created by running the following command:

```terminal
$ cp /<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/manifests/* ./manifests/
```

5. Copy the tls directory that contains the private key to the installation directory:

```terminal
$ cp -a /<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/tls .
```


# Deploying the cluster

You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on a compatible cloud platform.


[IMPORTANT]
----
You can run the create cluster command of the installation program only once, during initial installation.
----

* You have configured an account with the cloud platform that hosts your cluster.
* You have the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.
* You have verified that the cloud provider account on your host has the correct permissions to deploy the cluster. An account with incorrect permissions causes the installation process to fail with an error message that displays the missing permissions.

1. Remove any existing GCP credentials that do not use the service account key
for the GCP account that you configured for your cluster and that are stored in the
following locations:
* The GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS, GOOGLE_CLOUD_KEYFILE_JSON, or GCLOUD_KEYFILE_JSON
environment variables
* The ~/.gcp/osServiceAccount.json file
* The gcloud cli default credentials
2. Change to the directory that contains the installation program and initialize the cluster deployment:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install create cluster --dir <installation_directory> \ 1
    --log-level=info 2
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the
location of your customized ./install-config.yaml file.
To view different installation details, specify warn, debug, or
error instead of info.
3. Optional: You can reduce the number of permissions for the service account that you used to install the cluster.
* If you assigned the Owner role to your service account, you can remove that role and replace it with the Viewer role.
* If you included the Service Account Key Admin role,
you can remove it.

When the cluster deployment completes successfully:

* The terminal displays directions for accessing your cluster, including a link to the web console and credentials for the kubeadmin user.
* Credential information also outputs to <installation_directory>/.openshift_install.log.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not delete the installation program or the files that the installation program creates. Both are required to delete the cluster.
----


```terminal
...
INFO Install complete!
INFO To access the cluster as the system:admin user when using 'oc', run 'export KUBECONFIG=/home/myuser/install_dir/auth/kubeconfig'
INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.mycluster.example.com
INFO Login to the console with user: "kubeadmin", and password: "password"
INFO Time elapsed: 36m22s
```



[IMPORTANT]
----
* The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending node-bootstrapper certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for Recovering from expired control plane certificates for more information.
* It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.

# Logging in to the cluster by using the CLI

You can log in to your cluster as a default system user by exporting the cluster kubeconfig file.
The kubeconfig file contains information about the cluster that is used by the CLI to connect a client to the correct cluster and API server.
The file is specific to a cluster and is created during Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation.

* You deployed an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* You installed the oc CLI.

1. Export the kubeadmin credentials:

```terminal
$ export KUBECONFIG=<installation_directory>/auth/kubeconfig 1
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the path to the directory that you stored
the installation files in.
2. Verify you can run oc commands successfully using the exported configuration:

```terminal
$ oc whoami
```

Example output

```terminal
system:admin
```


* See Accessing the web console for more details about accessing and understanding the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

# Telemetry access for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.17, the Telemetry service, which runs by default to provide metrics about cluster health and the success of updates, requires internet access. If your cluster is connected to the internet, Telemetry runs automatically, and your cluster is registered to OpenShift Cluster Manager.

After you confirm that your OpenShift Cluster Manager inventory is correct, either maintained automatically by Telemetry or manually by using OpenShift Cluster Manager, use subscription watch to track your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform subscriptions at the account or multi-cluster level.

* See About remote health monitoring for more information about the Telemetry service

# Next steps

* Customize your cluster.
* If necessary, you can
opt out of remote health reporting.
