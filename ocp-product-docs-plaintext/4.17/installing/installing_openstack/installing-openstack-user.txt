# Installing a cluster on OpenStack on your own infrastructure


In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.17, you can install a cluster on
Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) that runs on user-provisioned infrastructure.
Using your own infrastructure allows you to integrate your cluster with existing infrastructure and modifications. The process requires more labor on your part than installer-provisioned installations, because you must create all RHOSP resources, like Nova servers, Neutron ports, and security groups. However, Red Hat provides Ansible playbooks to help you in the deployment process.

# Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation and update processes.
* You read the documentation on selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users.
* You verified that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.17 is compatible with your RHOSP version by using the Supported platforms for OpenShift clusters section. You can also compare platform support across different versions by viewing the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on RHOSP support matrix.
* You have an RHOSP account where you want to install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
* You understand performance and scalability practices for cluster scaling, control plane sizing, and etcd. For more information, see Recommended practices for scaling the cluster.
* On the machine from which you run the installation program, you have:
* A single directory in which you can keep the files you create during the installation process
* Python 3

# Internet access for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.17, you require access to the internet to
install
your cluster.

You must have internet access to perform the following actions:

* Access OpenShift Cluster Manager to download the installation program and perform subscription management. If the cluster has internet access and you do not disable Telemetry, that service automatically entitles your cluster.
* Access Quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install your cluster.
* Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.

# Resource guidelines for installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on RHOSP

To support an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation, your Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) quota must meet the following requirements:



A cluster might function with fewer than recommended resources, but its performance is not guaranteed.


[IMPORTANT]
----
If RHOSP object storage (Swift) is available and operated by a user account with the swiftoperator role, it is used as the default backend for the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform image registry. In this case, the volume storage requirement is 175 GB. Swift space requirements vary depending on the size of the image registry.
----


[NOTE]
----
By default, your security group and security group rule quotas might be low. If you encounter problems, run openstack quota set --secgroups 3 --secgroup-rules 60 <project> as an administrator to increase them.
----

An Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform deployment comprises control plane machines, compute machines, and a bootstrap machine.

## Control plane machines

By default, the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation process creates three control
plane machines.

Each machine requires:

* An instance from the RHOSP quota
* A port from the RHOSP quota
* A flavor with at least 16 GB memory and 4 vCPUs
* At least 100 GB storage space from the RHOSP quota

## Compute machines

By default, the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation process creates three compute
machines.

Each machine requires:

* An instance from the RHOSP quota
* A port from the RHOSP quota
* A flavor with at least 8 GB memory and 2 vCPUs
* At least 100 GB storage space from the RHOSP quota


[TIP]
----
Compute machines host the applications that you run on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform; aim to
run as many as you can.
----

## Bootstrap machine

During installation, a bootstrap machine is temporarily provisioned to stand up the
control plane. After the production control plane is ready, the bootstrap
machine is deprovisioned.

The bootstrap machine requires:

* An instance from the RHOSP quota
* A port from the RHOSP quota
* A flavor with at least 16 GB memory and 4 vCPUs
* At least 100 GB storage space from the RHOSP quota

# Downloading playbook dependencies

The Ansible playbooks that simplify the installation process on user-provisioned infrastructure require several ansible collections and Python modules. On the machine where you will run the installation program, add the Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) repositories and then install the packages.

The following dependencies are required:

* Python modules:
* openstackclient
* openstacksdk
* netaddr
* pip
* Ansible collections:
* ansible-collections-openstack, which installs Ansible Core
* ansible-collection-community-general
* ansible-collection-ansible-netcommon


[NOTE]
----
These instructions assume that you are using Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.
----

* Python 3 is installed on your machine.

1. On a command line, add the repositories:
1. Register with Red Hat Subscription Manager:

```terminal
$ sudo subscription-manager register # If not done already
```

2. Pull the latest subscription data:

```terminal
$ sudo subscription-manager attach --pool=$YOUR_POOLID # If not done already
```

3. Disable the current repositories:

```terminal
$ sudo subscription-manager repos --disable=* # If not done already
```

4. Add the required repositories:

```terminal
$ sudo subscription-manager repos \
  --enable=rhel-9-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms \
  --enable=rhel-9-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms \
  --enable=openstack-17.1-for-rhel-9-x86_64-rpms
```

2. Install the modules:

```terminal
$ sudo dnf install ansible-collection-ansible-netcommon \
    ansible-collection-community-general \
    ansible-collections-openstack \
    python3-netaddr \
    python3-openstackclient \
    python3-openstacksdk \
    python3-pip
```

3. Ensure that the python command points to python3:

```terminal
$ sudo alternatives --set python /usr/bin/python3
```


# Downloading the installation playbooks

Download Ansible playbooks that you can use to install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on your own Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) infrastructure.

* The curl command-line tool is available on your machine.

* To download the playbooks to your working directory, run the following script from a command line:

```terminal
$ xargs -n 1 curl -O <<< '
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/installer/release-4.17/upi/openstack/bootstrap.yaml
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/installer/release-4.17/upi/openstack/common.yaml
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/installer/release-4.17/upi/openstack/compute-nodes.yaml
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/installer/release-4.17/upi/openstack/control-plane.yaml

        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/installer/release-4.17/upi/openstack/down-security-groups.yaml
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/installer/release-4.17/upi/openstack/down-containers.yaml
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/installer/release-4.17/upi/openstack/inventory.yaml
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/installer/release-4.17/upi/openstack/network.yaml
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/installer/release-4.17/upi/openstack/security-groups.yaml
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/installer/release-4.17/upi/openstack/update-network-resources.yaml'
```


The playbooks are downloaded to your machine.


[IMPORTANT]
----
During the installation process, you can modify the playbooks to configure your deployment.
Retain all playbooks for the life of your cluster. You must have the playbooks to remove your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster from RHOSP.
----


[IMPORTANT]
----
You must match any edits you make in the bootstrap.yaml, compute-nodes.yaml, control-plane.yaml, network.yaml, and security-groups.yaml files to the corresponding playbooks that are prefixed with down-. For example, edits to the bootstrap.yaml file must be reflected in the down-bootstrap.yaml file, too. If you do not edit both files, the supported cluster removal process will fail.
----

# Obtaining the installation program

Before you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, download the installation file on
 the host you are using for installation.

* You have a computer that runs Linux or macOS, with 500 MB of local disk space.

1. Go to the Cluster Type page on the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console. If you have a Red Hat account, log in with your credentials. If you do not, create an account.

[TIP]
----
You can also download the binaries for a specific Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release.
----
2. Select your infrastructure provider from the Run it yourself section of the page.
3. Select your host operating system and architecture from the dropdown menus under OpenShift Installer and click Download Installer.
4. Place the downloaded file in the directory where you want to store the installation configuration files.

[IMPORTANT]
----
* The installation program creates several files on the computer that you use to install your cluster. You must keep the installation program and the files that the installation program creates after you finish installing the cluster. Both of the files are required to delete the cluster.
* Deleting the files created by the installation program does not remove your cluster, even if the cluster failed during installation. To remove your cluster, complete the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform uninstallation procedures for your specific cloud provider.
----
5. Extract the installation program. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

```terminal
$ tar -xvf openshift-install-linux.tar.gz
```

6. Download your installation pull secret from Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager. This pull secret allows you to authenticate with the services that are provided by the included authorities, including Quay.io, which serves the container images for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform components.


[TIP]
----
Alternatively, you can retrieve the installation program from the Red Hat Customer Portal, where you can specify a version of the installation program to download.
However, you must have an active subscription to access this page.
----

# Generating a key pair for cluster node SSH access

During an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation, you can provide an SSH public key to the installation program. The key is passed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) nodes through their Ignition config files and is used to authenticate SSH access to the nodes. The key is added to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys list for the core user on each node, which enables password-less authentication.

After the key is passed to the nodes, you can use the key pair to SSH in to the RHCOS nodes as the user core. To access the nodes through SSH, the private key identity must be managed by SSH for your local user.

If you want to SSH in to your cluster nodes to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, you must provide the SSH public key during the installation process. The ./openshift-install gather command also requires the SSH public key to be in place on the cluster nodes.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not skip this procedure in production environments, where disaster recovery and debugging is required.
----


[NOTE]
----
You must use a local key, not one that you configured with platform-specific
approaches such as
AWS key pairs.
----

1. If you do not have an existing SSH key pair on your local machine to use for authentication onto your cluster nodes, create one. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

```terminal
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N '' -f <path>/<file_name> 1
```

Specify the path and file name, such as ~/.ssh/id_ed25519, of the new SSH key. If you have an existing key pair, ensure your public key is in the your ~/.ssh directory.

[NOTE]
----
If you plan to install an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster that uses the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures, do not create a key that uses the ed25519 algorithm. Instead, create a key that uses the rsa or ecdsa algorithm.
----
2. View the public SSH key:

```terminal
$ cat <path>/<file_name>.pub
```


For example, run the following to view the ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub public key:

```terminal
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

3. Add the SSH private key identity to the SSH agent for your local user, if it has not already been added. SSH agent management of the key is required for password-less SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes, or if you want to use the ./openshift-install gather command.

[NOTE]
----
On some distributions, default SSH private key identities such as ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_dsa are managed automatically.
----
1. If the ssh-agent process is not already running for your local user, start it as a background task:

```terminal
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

Example output

```terminal
Agent pid 31874
```


[NOTE]
----
If your cluster is in FIPS mode, only use FIPS-compliant algorithms to generate the SSH key. The key must be either RSA or ECDSA.
----
4. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent:

```terminal
$ ssh-add <path>/<file_name> 1
```

Specify the path and file name for your SSH private key, such as ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
Example output

```terminal
Identity added: /home/<you>/<path>/<file_name> (<computer_name>)
```


* When you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, provide the SSH public key to the installation program.

# Creating the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) image

The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program requires that a Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) image be present in the Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) cluster. Retrieve the latest RHCOS image, then upload it using the RHOSP CLI.

* The RHOSP CLI is installed.

1. Log in to the Red Hat Customer Portal's Product Downloads page.
2. Under Version, select the most recent release of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.17 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.

[IMPORTANT]
----
The RHCOS images might not change with every release of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
You must download images with the highest version that is less than or equal to
the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version that you install. Use the image versions that match
your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version if they are available.
----
3. Download the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) - OpenStack Image (QCOW).
4. Decompress the image.

[NOTE]
----
You must decompress the RHOSP image before the cluster can use it. The name of the downloaded file might not contain a compression extension, like .gz or .tgz. To find out if or how the file is compressed, in a command line, enter:

```terminal
$ file <name_of_downloaded_file>
```

----
5. From the image that you downloaded, create an image that is named rhcos in your cluster by using the RHOSP CLI:

```terminal
$ openstack image create --container-format=bare --disk-format=qcow2 --file rhcos-${RHCOS_VERSION}-openstack.qcow2 rhcos
```


[IMPORTANT]
----
Depending on your RHOSP environment, you might be able to upload the image in either .raw or .qcow2 formats. If you use Ceph, you must use the .raw format.
----

[WARNING]
----
If the installation program finds multiple images with the same name, it chooses one of them at random. To avoid this behavior, create unique names for resources in RHOSP.
----

After you upload the image to RHOSP, it is usable in the installation process.

# Verifying external network access

The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation process requires external network access. You must provide an external network value to it, or deployment fails. Before you begin the process, verify that a network with the external router type exists in Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP).

* Configure OpenStack's networking service to have DHCP agents forward instances' DNS queries

1. Using the RHOSP CLI, verify the name and ID of the 'External' network:

```terminal
$ openstack network list --long -c ID -c Name -c "Router Type"
```

Example output

```terminal
+--------------------------------------+----------------+-------------+
| ID                                   | Name           | Router Type |
+--------------------------------------+----------------+-------------+
| 148a8023-62a7-4672-b018-003462f8d7dc | public_network | External    |
+--------------------------------------+----------------+-------------+
```


A network with an external router type appears in the network list. If at least one does not, see Creating a default floating IP network and Creating a default provider network.


[NOTE]
----
If the Neutron trunk service plugin is enabled, a trunk port is created by default. For more information, see Neutron trunk port.
----

# Enabling access to the environment

At deployment, all Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform machines are created in a Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP)-tenant network. Therefore, they are not accessible directly in most RHOSP deployments.

You can configure Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform API and application access by using floating IP addresses (FIPs) during installation. You can also complete an installation without configuring FIPs, but the installer will not configure a way to reach the API or applications externally.

## Enabling access with floating IP addresses

Create floating IP (FIP) addresses for external access to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
API, cluster applications, and the bootstrap process.

1. Using the Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) CLI, create the API FIP:

```terminal
$ openstack floating ip create --description "API <cluster_name>.<base_domain>" <external_network>
```

2. Using the Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) CLI, create the apps, or Ingress, FIP:

```terminal
$ openstack floating ip create --description "Ingress <cluster_name>.<base_domain>" <external_network>
```

3. By using the Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) CLI, create the bootstrap FIP:

```terminal
$ openstack floating ip create --description "bootstrap machine" <external_network>
```

4. Add records that follow these patterns to your DNS server for the API and Ingress FIPs:

```dns
api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.  IN  A  <API_FIP>
*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>. IN  A <apps_FIP>
```


[NOTE]
----
If you do not control the DNS server, you can access the cluster by adding the cluster domain names such as the following to your /etc/hosts file:
* <api_floating_ip> api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
* <application_floating_ip> grafana-openshift-monitoring.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
* <application_floating_ip> prometheus-k8s-openshift-monitoring.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
* <application_floating_ip> oauth-openshift.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
* <application_floating_ip> console-openshift-console.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
* application_floating_ip integrated-oauth-server-openshift-authentication.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
The cluster domain names in the /etc/hosts file grant access to the web console and the monitoring interface of your cluster locally. You can also use the kubectl or oc. You can access the user applications by using the additional entries pointing to the <application_floating_ip>. This action makes the API and applications accessible to only you, which is not suitable for production deployment, but does allow installation for development and testing.
----
5. Add the FIPs to the
inventory.yaml
file as the values of the following
variables:
* os_api_fip
* os_bootstrap_fip
* os_ingress_fip

If you use these values, you must also enter an external network as the value of the
os_external_network variable in the inventory.yaml file.


[TIP]
----
You can make Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform resources available outside of the cluster by assigning a floating IP address and updating your firewall configuration.
----

## Completing installation without floating IP addresses

You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) without providing floating IP addresses.

In the
inventory.yaml
file, do not define the following
variables:

* os_api_fip
* os_bootstrap_fip
* os_ingress_fip

If you cannot provide an external network, you can also leave os_external_network blank. If you do not provide a value for os_external_network, a router is not created for you, and, without additional action, the installer will fail to retrieve an image from Glance. Later in the installation process, when you create network resources, you must configure external connectivity on your own.

If you run the installer
with the wait-for command
from a system that cannot reach the cluster API due to a lack of floating IP addresses or name resolution, installation fails. To prevent installation failure in these cases, you can use a proxy network or run the installer from a system that is on the same network as your machines.


[NOTE]
----
You can enable name resolution by creating DNS records for the API and Ingress ports. For example:

```dns
api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>.  IN  A  <api_port_IP>
*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>. IN  A <ingress_port_IP>
```

If you do not control the DNS server, you can add the record to your /etc/hosts file. This action makes the API accessible to only you, which is not suitable for production deployment but does allow installation for development and testing.
----

# Defining parameters for the installation program

The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program relies on a file that is called clouds.yaml. The file describes Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) configuration parameters, including the project name, log in information, and authorization service URLs.

1. Create the clouds.yaml file:
* If your RHOSP distribution includes the Horizon web UI, generate a clouds.yaml file in it.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Remember to add a password to the auth field. You can also keep secrets in a separate file from clouds.yaml.
----
* If your RHOSP distribution does not include the Horizon web UI, or you do not want to use Horizon, create the file yourself. For detailed information about clouds.yaml, see Config files in the RHOSP documentation.

```yaml
clouds:
  shiftstack:
    auth:
      auth_url: http://10.10.14.42:5000/v3
      project_name: shiftstack
      username: <username>
      password: <password>
      user_domain_name: Default
      project_domain_name: Default
  dev-env:
    region_name: RegionOne
    auth:
      username: <username>
      password: <password>
      project_name: 'devonly'
      auth_url: 'https://10.10.14.22:5001/v2.0'
```

2. If your RHOSP installation uses self-signed certificate authority (CA) certificates for endpoint authentication:
1. Copy the certificate authority file to your machine.
2. Add the cacerts key to the clouds.yaml file. The value must be an absolute, non-root-accessible path to the CA certificate:

```yaml
clouds:
  shiftstack:
    ...
    cacert: "/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/ca.crt.pem"
```


[TIP]
----
After you run the installer with a custom CA certificate, you can update the certificate by editing the value of the ca-cert.pem key in the cloud-provider-config keymap. On a command line, run:

```terminal
$ oc edit configmap -n openshift-config cloud-provider-config
```

----
3. Place the clouds.yaml file in one of the following locations:
1. The value of the OS_CLIENT_CONFIG_FILE environment variable
2. The current directory
3. A Unix-specific user configuration directory, for example ~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml
4. A Unix-specific site configuration directory, for example /etc/openstack/clouds.yaml

The installation program searches for clouds.yaml in that order.

# Creating network resources on RHOSP

Create the network resources that an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) installation on your own infrastructure requires. To save time, run supplied Ansible playbooks that generate security groups, networks, subnets, routers, and ports.

* You downloaded the modules in "Downloading playbook dependencies".
* You downloaded the playbooks in "Downloading the installation playbooks".

1. For a dual stack cluster deployment, edit the inventory.yaml file and uncomment the os_subnet6 attribute.
2. To ensure that your network resources have unique names on the RHOSP deployment, create an environment variable and JSON file for use in the Ansible playbooks:
1. Create an environment variable that has a unique name value by running the following command:

```terminal
$ export OS_NET_ID="openshift-$(dd if=/dev/urandom count=4 bs=1 2>/dev/null |hexdump -e '"%02x"')"
```

2. Verify that the variable is set by running the following command on a command line:

```terminal
$ echo $OS_NET_ID
```

3. Create a JSON object that includes the variable in a file called netid.json by running the following command:

```terminal
$ echo "{\"os_net_id\": \"$OS_NET_ID\"}" | tee netid.json
```

3. On a command line, create the network resources by running the following command:

```terminal
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml network.yaml
```


[NOTE]
----
The API and Ingress VIP fields will be overwritten in the inventory.yaml playbook with the IP addresses assigned to the network ports.
----

[NOTE]
----
The resources created by the network.yaml playbook are deleted by the down-network.yaml playbook.
----

# Creating the installation configuration file

You can customize the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster you install on
Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP).

* You have the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.

1. Create the install-config.yaml file.
1. Change to the directory that contains the installation program and run the following command:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install create install-config --dir <installation_directory> 1
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the directory name to store the
files that the installation program creates.

When specifying the directory:
* Verify that the directory has the execute permission. This permission is required to run Terraform binaries under the installation directory.
* Use an empty directory. Some installation assets, such as bootstrap X.509 certificates, have short expiration intervals, therefore you must not reuse an installation directory. If you want to reuse individual files from another cluster installation, you can copy them into your directory. However, the file names for the installation assets might change between releases. Use caution when copying installation files from an earlier Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version.
2. At the prompts, provide the configuration details for your cloud:
1. Optional: Select an SSH key to use to access your cluster machines.

[NOTE]
----
For production Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your ssh-agent process uses.
----
2. Select openstack as the platform to target.
3. Specify the Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) external network name to use for installing the cluster.
4. Specify the floating IP address to use for external access to the OpenShift API.
5. Specify a RHOSP flavor with at least 16 GB RAM to use for control plane nodes
and 8 GB RAM for compute nodes.
6. Select the base domain to deploy the cluster to. All DNS records will be
sub-domains of this base and will also include the cluster name.
7. Enter a name for your cluster. The name must be 14 or fewer characters long.
2. Modify the install-config.yaml file. You can find more information about the available parameters in the "Installation configuration parameters" section.
3. Back up the install-config.yaml file so that you can use
it to install multiple clusters.

[IMPORTANT]
----
The install-config.yaml file is consumed during the installation process. If
you want to reuse the file, you must back it up now.
----

You now have the file install-config.yaml in the directory that you specified.

* Installation configuration parameters for OpenStack

## Custom subnets in RHOSP deployments

Optionally, you can deploy a cluster on a Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) subnet of your choice. The subnet&#8217;s GUID is passed as the value of platform.openstack.machinesSubnet in the install-config.yaml file.

This subnet is used as the cluster&#8217;s primary subnet. By default, nodes and ports are created on it. You can create nodes and ports on a different RHOSP subnet by setting the value of the platform.openstack.machinesSubnet property to the subnet&#8217;s UUID.

Before you run the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installer with a custom subnet, verify that your configuration meets the following requirements:

* The subnet that is used by platform.openstack.machinesSubnet has DHCP enabled.
* The CIDR of platform.openstack.machinesSubnet matches the CIDR of networking.machineNetwork.
* The installation program user has permission to create ports on this network, including ports with fixed IP addresses.

Clusters that use custom subnets have the following limitations:

* If you plan to install a cluster that uses floating IP addresses, the platform.openstack.machinesSubnet subnet must be attached to a router that is connected to the externalNetwork network.
* If the platform.openstack.machinesSubnet value is set in the install-config.yaml file, the installation program does not create a private network or subnet for your RHOSP machines.
* You cannot use the platform.openstack.externalDNS property at the same time as a custom subnet. To add DNS to a cluster that uses a custom subnet, configure DNS on the RHOSP network.


[NOTE]
----
By default, the API VIP takes x.x.x.5 and the Ingress VIP takes x.x.x.7 from your network's CIDR block. To override these default values,
set values for platform.openstack.apiVIPs and platform.openstack.ingressVIPs that are outside of the DHCP allocation pool.
----


[IMPORTANT]

The CIDR ranges for networks are not adjustable after cluster installation. Red Hat does not provide direct guidance on determining the range during cluster installation because it requires careful consideration of the number of created pods per namespace.

## Setting a custom subnet for machines

The IP range that the installation program uses by default might not match the Neutron subnet that you create when you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. If necessary, update the CIDR value for new machines by editing the installation configuration file.

* You have the install-config.yaml file that was generated by the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program.
* You have Python 3 installed.

1. On a command line, browse to the directory that contains the install-config.yaml and inventory.yaml files.
2. From that directory, either run a script to edit the install-config.yaml file or update the file manually:
* To set the value by using a script, run the following command:

```terminal
$ python -c 'import os
import sys
import yaml
import re
re_os_net_id = re.compile(r"{{\s*os_net_id\s*}}")
os_net_id = os.getenv("OS_NET_ID")
path = "common.yaml"
facts = None
for _dict in yaml.safe_load(open(path))[0]["tasks"]:
    if "os_network" in _dict.get("set_fact", {}):
        facts = _dict["set_fact"]
        break
if not facts:
    print("Cannot find `os_network` in common.yaml file. Make sure OpenStack resource names are defined in one of the tasks.")
    sys.exit(1)
os_network = re_os_net_id.sub(os_net_id, facts["os_network"])
os_subnet = re_os_net_id.sub(os_net_id, facts["os_subnet"])
path = "install-config.yaml"
data = yaml.safe_load(open(path))
inventory = yaml.safe_load(open("inventory.yaml"))["all"]["hosts"]["localhost"]
machine_net = [{"cidr": inventory["os_subnet_range"]}]
api_vips = [inventory["os_apiVIP"]]
ingress_vips = [inventory["os_ingressVIP"]]
ctrl_plane_port = {"network": {"name": os_network}, "fixedIPs": [{"subnet": {"name": os_subnet}}]}
if inventory.get("os_subnet6_range"): 1
    os_subnet6 = re_os_net_id.sub(os_net_id, facts["os_subnet6"])
    machine_net.append({"cidr": inventory["os_subnet6_range"]})
    api_vips.append(inventory["os_apiVIP6"])
    ingress_vips.append(inventory["os_ingressVIP6"])
    data["networking"]["networkType"] = "OVNKubernetes"
    data["networking"]["clusterNetwork"].append({"cidr": inventory["cluster_network6_cidr"], "hostPrefix": inventory["cluster_network6_prefix"]})
    data["networking"]["serviceNetwork"].append(inventory["service_subnet6_range"])
    ctrl_plane_port["fixedIPs"].append({"subnet": {"name": os_subnet6}})
data["networking"]["machineNetwork"] = machine_net
data["platform"]["openstack"]["apiVIPs"] = api_vips
data["platform"]["openstack"]["ingressVIPs"] = ingress_vips
data["platform"]["openstack"]["controlPlanePort"] = ctrl_plane_port
del data["platform"]["openstack"]["externalDNS"]
open(path, "w").write(yaml.dump(data, default_flow_style=False))'
```

Applies to dual stack (IPv4/IPv6) environments.

## Emptying compute machine pools

To proceed with an installation that uses your own infrastructure, set the number of compute machines in the installation configuration file to zero. Later, you create these machines manually.

* You have the install-config.yaml file that was generated by the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program.

1. On a command line, browse to the directory that contains install-config.yaml.
2. From that directory, either run a script to edit the install-config.yaml file or update the file manually:
* To set the value by using a script, run:

```terminal
$ python -c '
import yaml;
path = "install-config.yaml";
data = yaml.safe_load(open(path));
data["compute"][0]["replicas"] = 0;
open(path, "w").write(yaml.dump(data, default_flow_style=False))'
```

* To set the value manually, open the file and set the value of compute.<first entry>.replicas to 0.

## Cluster deployment on RHOSP provider networks

You can deploy your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) with a primary network interface on a provider network. Provider networks are commonly used to give projects direct access to a public network that can be used to reach the internet. You can also share provider networks among projects as part of the network creation process.

RHOSP provider networks map directly to an existing physical network in the data center. A RHOSP administrator must create them.

In the following example, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform workloads are connected to a data center by using a provider network:

![A diagram that depicts four OpenShift workloads on OpenStack. Each workload is connected by its NIC to an external data center by using a provider network.]

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters that are installed on provider networks do not require tenant networks or floating IP addresses. The installer does not create these resources during installation.

Example provider network types include flat (untagged) and VLAN (802.1Q tagged).


[NOTE]
----
A cluster can support as many provider network connections as the network type allows. For example, VLAN networks typically support up to 4096 connections.
----

You can learn more about provider and tenant networks in the RHOSP documentation.

### RHOSP provider network requirements for cluster installation

Before you install an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, your Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) deployment and provider network must meet a number of conditions:

* The RHOSP networking service (Neutron) is enabled and accessible through the RHOSP networking API.
* The RHOSP networking service has the port security and allowed address pairs extensions enabled.
* The provider network can be shared with other tenants.

[TIP]
----
Use the openstack network create command with the --share flag to create a network that can be shared.
----
* The RHOSP project that you use to install the cluster must own the provider network, as well as an appropriate subnet.

[TIP]
----
To create a network for a project that is named "openshift," enter the following command:: 

```terminal
$ openstack network create --project openshift
```

To create a subnet for a project that is named "openshift," enter the following command:: 

```terminal
$ openstack subnet create --project openshift
```

To learn more about creating networks on RHOSP, read the provider networks documentation.
----

If the cluster is owned by the admin user, you must run the installer as that user to create ports on the network.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Provider networks must be owned by the RHOSP project that is used to create the cluster. If they are not, the RHOSP Compute service (Nova) cannot request a port from that network.
----
* Verify that the provider network can reach the RHOSP metadata service IP address, which is 169.254.169.254 by default.

Depending on your RHOSP SDN and networking service configuration, you might need to provide the route when you create the subnet. For example:

```terminal
$ openstack subnet create --dhcp --host-route destination=169.254.169.254/32,gateway=192.0.2.2 ...
```

* Optional: To secure the network, create role-based access control (RBAC) rules that limit network access to a single project.

### Deploying a cluster that has a primary interface on a provider network

You can deploy an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster that has its primary network interface on an Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) provider network.

* Your Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) deployment is configured as described by "RHOSP provider network requirements for cluster installation".

1. In a text editor, open the install-config.yaml file.
2. Set the value of the platform.openstack.apiVIPs property to the IP address for the API VIP.
3. Set the value of the platform.openstack.ingressVIPs property to the IP address for the Ingress VIP.
4. Set the value of the platform.openstack.machinesSubnet property to the UUID of the provider network subnet.
5. Set the value of the networking.machineNetwork.cidr property to the CIDR block of the provider network subnet.


[IMPORTANT]
----
The platform.openstack.apiVIPs and platform.openstack.ingressVIPs properties must both be unassigned IP addresses from the networking.machineNetwork.cidr block.
----


```yaml
        ...
        platform:
          openstack:
            apiVIPs: 1
              - 192.0.2.13
            ingressVIPs: 1
              - 192.0.2.23
            machinesSubnet: fa806b2f-ac49-4bce-b9db-124bc64209bf
            # ...
        networking:
          machineNetwork:
          - cidr: 192.0.2.0/24
```


In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 and later, the apiVIP and ingressVIP configuration settings are deprecated. Instead, use a list format to enter values in the apiVIPs and ingressVIPs configuration settings.


[WARNING]
----
You cannot set the platform.openstack.externalNetwork or platform.openstack.externalDNS parameters while using a provider network for the primary network interface.
----

When you deploy the cluster, the installer uses the install-config.yaml file to deploy the cluster on the provider network.


[TIP]
----
You can add additional networks, including provider networks, to the platform.openstack.additionalNetworkIDs list.
After you deploy your cluster, you can attach pods to additional networks. For more information, see Understanding multiple networks.
----

# Creating the Kubernetes manifest and Ignition config files

Because you must modify some cluster definition files and manually start the cluster machines, you must generate the Kubernetes manifest and Ignition config files that the cluster needs to configure the machines.

The installation configuration file transforms into the Kubernetes manifests. The manifests wrap into the Ignition configuration files, which are later used to configure the cluster machines.


[IMPORTANT]
----
* The Ignition config files that the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending node-bootstrapper certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for Recovering from expired control plane certificates for more information.
* It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.
----

* You obtained the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program.
* You created the install-config.yaml installation configuration file.

1. Change to the directory that contains the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program and generate the Kubernetes manifests for the cluster:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory> 1
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the installation directory that
contains the install-config.yaml file you created.
2. Remove the Kubernetes manifest files that define the control plane machines, compute machine sets, and control plane machine sets:

```terminal
$ rm -f openshift/99_openshift-cluster-api_master-machines-*.yaml openshift/99_openshift-cluster-api_worker-machineset-*.yaml openshift/99_openshift-machine-api_master-control-plane-machine-set.yaml
```


Because you create and manage these resources yourself, you do not have
to initialize them.
* You can preserve the compute machine set files to create compute machines by using the machine API, but you must update references to them to match your environment.
3. Check that the mastersSchedulable parameter in the <installation_directory>/manifests/cluster-scheduler-02-config.yml Kubernetes manifest file is set to false. This setting prevents pods from being scheduled on the control plane machines:
1. Open the <installation_directory>/manifests/cluster-scheduler-02-config.yml file.
2. Locate the mastersSchedulable parameter and ensure that it is set to false.
3. Save and exit the file.
4. To create the Ignition configuration files, run the following command from the directory that contains the installation program:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install create ignition-configs --dir <installation_directory> 1
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the same installation directory.

Ignition config files are created for the bootstrap, control plane, and compute nodes in the installation directory. The kubeadmin-password and kubeconfig files are created in the ./<installation_directory>/auth directory:

```
.
├── auth
│   ├── kubeadmin-password
│   └── kubeconfig
├── bootstrap.ign
├── master.ign
├── metadata.json
└── worker.ign
```

5. Export the metadata file's infraID key as an environment variable:

```terminal
$ export INFRA_ID=$(jq -r .infraID metadata.json)
```



[TIP]
----
Extract the infraID key from metadata.json and use it as a prefix for all of the RHOSP resources that you create. By doing so, you avoid name conflicts when making multiple deployments in the same project.
----

# Preparing the bootstrap Ignition files

The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation process relies on bootstrap machines that are created from a bootstrap Ignition configuration file.

Edit the file and upload it. Then, create a secondary bootstrap Ignition configuration file that
Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) uses to download the primary file.

* You have the bootstrap Ignition file that the installer program generates, bootstrap.ign.
* The infrastructure ID from the installer's metadata file is set as an environment variable ($INFRA_ID).
* If the variable is not set, see Creating the Kubernetes manifest and Ignition config files.
* You have an HTTP(S)-accessible way to store the bootstrap Ignition file.
* The documented procedure uses the RHOSP image service (Glance), but you can also use the RHOSP storage service (Swift), Amazon S3, an internal HTTP server, or an ad hoc Nova server.

1. Run the following Python script. The script modifies the bootstrap Ignition file to set the hostname and, if available, CA certificate file when it runs:

```python
import base64
import json
import os

with open('bootstrap.ign', 'r') as f:
    ignition = json.load(f)

files = ignition['storage'].get('files', [])

infra_id = os.environ.get('INFRA_ID', 'openshift').encode()
hostname_b64 = base64.standard_b64encode(infra_id + b'-bootstrap\n').decode().strip()
files.append(
{
    'path': '/etc/hostname',
    'mode': 420,
    'contents': {
        'source': 'data:text/plain;charset=utf-8;base64,' + hostname_b64
    }
})

ca_cert_path = os.environ.get('OS_CACERT', '')
if ca_cert_path:
    with open(ca_cert_path, 'r') as f:
        ca_cert = f.read().encode()
        ca_cert_b64 = base64.standard_b64encode(ca_cert).decode().strip()

    files.append(
    {
        'path': '/opt/openshift/tls/cloud-ca-cert.pem',
        'mode': 420,
        'contents': {
            'source': 'data:text/plain;charset=utf-8;base64,' + ca_cert_b64
        }
    })

ignition['storage']['files'] = files;

with open('bootstrap.ign', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(ignition, f)
```

2. Using the RHOSP CLI, create an image that uses the bootstrap Ignition file:

```terminal
$ openstack image create --disk-format=raw --container-format=bare --file bootstrap.ign <image_name>
```

3. Get the image's details:

```terminal
$ openstack image show <image_name>
```


Make a note of the file value; it follows the pattern v2/images/<image_ID>/file.

[NOTE]
----
Verify that the image you created is active.
----
4. Retrieve the image service's public address:

```terminal
$ openstack catalog show image
```

5. Combine the public address with the image file value and save the result as the storage location. The location follows the pattern <image_service_public_URL>/v2/images/<image_ID>/file.
6. Generate an auth token and save the token ID:

```terminal
$ openstack token issue -c id -f value
```

7. Insert the following content into a file called $INFRA_ID-bootstrap-ignition.json and edit the placeholders to match your own values:

```json
{
  "ignition": {
    "config": {
      "merge": [{
        "source": "<storage_url>", 1
        "httpHeaders": [{
          "name": "X-Auth-Token", 2
          "value": "<token_ID>" 3
        }]
      }]
    },
    "security": {
      "tls": {
        "certificateAuthorities": [{
          "source": "data:text/plain;charset=utf-8;base64,<base64_encoded_certificate>" 4
        }]
      }
    },
    "version": "3.2.0"
  }
}
```

Replace the value of ignition.config.merge.source with the bootstrap Ignition file storage URL.
Set name in httpHeaders to "X-Auth-Token".
Set value in httpHeaders to your token's ID.
If the bootstrap Ignition file server uses a self-signed certificate, include the base64-encoded certificate.
8. Save the secondary Ignition config file.

The bootstrap Ignition data will be passed to RHOSP during installation.


[WARNING]
----
The bootstrap Ignition file contains sensitive information, like clouds.yaml credentials. Ensure that you store it in a secure place, and delete it after you complete the installation process.
----

# Creating control plane Ignition config files on RHOSP

Installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) on your own infrastructure requires control plane Ignition config files. You must create multiple config files.


[NOTE]
----
As with the bootstrap Ignition configuration, you must explicitly define a hostname for each control plane machine.
----

* The infrastructure ID from the installation program's metadata file is set as an environment variable ($INFRA_ID).
* If the variable is not set, see "Creating the Kubernetes manifest and Ignition config files".

* On a command line, run the following Python script:

```terminal
$ for index in $(seq 0 2); do
    MASTER_HOSTNAME="$INFRA_ID-master-$index\n"
    python -c "import base64, json, sys;
ignition = json.load(sys.stdin);
storage = ignition.get('storage', {});
files = storage.get('files', []);
files.append({'path': '/etc/hostname', 'mode': 420, 'contents': {'source': 'data:text/plain;charset=utf-8;base64,' + base64.standard_b64encode(b'$MASTER_HOSTNAME').decode().strip(), 'verification': {}}, 'filesystem': 'root'});
storage['files'] = files;
ignition['storage'] = storage
json.dump(ignition, sys.stdout)" <master.ign >"$INFRA_ID-master-$index-ignition.json"
done
```


You now have three control plane Ignition files: <INFRA_ID>-master-0-ignition.json, <INFRA_ID>-master-1-ignition.json,
and <INFRA_ID>-master-2-ignition.json.

# Updating network resources on RHOSP

Update the network resources that an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) installation on your own infrastructure requires.

* Python 3 is installed on your machine.
* You downloaded the modules in "Downloading playbook dependencies".
* You downloaded the playbooks in "Downloading the installation playbooks".

1. Optional: Add an external network value to the inventory.yaml playbook:
Example external network value in the inventory.yaml Ansible Playbook

```yaml
...
      # The public network providing connectivity to the cluster. If not
      # provided, the cluster external connectivity must be provided in another
      # way.

      # Required for os_api_fip, os_ingress_fip, os_bootstrap_fip.
      os_external_network: 'external'
...
```


[IMPORTANT]
----
If you did not provide a value for os_external_network in the inventory.yaml file, you must ensure that VMs can access Glance and an external connection yourself.
----
2. Optional: Add external network and floating IP (FIP) address values to the inventory.yaml playbook:
Example FIP values in the inventory.yaml Ansible Playbook

```yaml
...
      # OpenShift API floating IP address. If this value is non-empty, the
      # corresponding floating IP will be attached to the Control Plane to
      # serve the OpenShift API.
      os_api_fip: '203.0.113.23'

      # OpenShift Ingress floating IP address. If this value is non-empty, the
      # corresponding floating IP will be attached to the worker nodes to serve
      # the applications.
      os_ingress_fip: '203.0.113.19'

      # If this value is non-empty, the corresponding floating IP will be
      # attached to the bootstrap machine. This is needed for collecting logs
      # in case of install failure.
      os_bootstrap_fip: '203.0.113.20'
```


[IMPORTANT]
----
If you do not define values for os_api_fip and os_ingress_fip, you must perform postinstallation network configuration.
If you do not define a value for os_bootstrap_fip, the installation program cannot download debugging information from failed installations.
See "Enabling access to the environment" for more information.
----
3. On a command line, create security groups by running the security-groups.yaml playbook:

```terminal
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml security-groups.yaml
```

4. On a command line, update the network resources by running the update-network-resources.yaml playbook:

```terminal
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml update-network-resources.yaml 1
```

This playbook will add tags to the network, subnets, ports, and router. It also attaches floating IP addresses to the API and Ingress ports and sets the security groups for those ports.
5. Optional: If you want to control the default resolvers that Nova servers use, run the RHOSP CLI command:

```terminal
$ openstack subnet set --dns-nameserver <server_1> --dns-nameserver <server_2> "$INFRA_ID-nodes"
```

6. Optional: You can use the inventory.yaml file that you created to customize your installation. For example, you can deploy a cluster that uses bare metal machines.

## Deploying a cluster with bare metal machines

If you want your cluster to use bare metal machines, modify the
inventory.yaml
file. Your cluster can have both control plane and compute machines running on bare metal, or just compute machines.


[NOTE]
----
Be sure that your install-config.yaml file reflects whether the RHOSP network that you use for bare metal workers supports floating IP addresses or not.
----

* The RHOSP Bare Metal service (Ironic) is enabled and accessible via the RHOSP Compute API.
* Bare metal is available as a RHOSP flavor.
* If your cluster runs on an RHOSP version that is more than 16.1.6 and less than 16.2.4, bare metal workers do not function due to a known issue that causes the metadata service to be unavailable for services on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform nodes.
* The RHOSP network supports both VM and bare metal server attachment.
* If you want to deploy the machines on a pre-existing network, a RHOSP subnet is provisioned.
* If you want to deploy the machines on an installer-provisioned network, the RHOSP Bare Metal service (Ironic) is able to listen for and interact with Preboot eXecution Environment (PXE) boot machines that run on tenant networks.
* You created an inventory.yaml file as part of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation process.

1. In the inventory.yaml file, edit the flavors for machines:
1. If you want to use bare-metal control plane machines, change the value of os_flavor_master to a bare metal flavor.
2. Change the value of os_flavor_worker to a bare metal flavor.
An example bare metal inventory.yaml file

```yaml
all:
  hosts:
    localhost:
      ansible_connection: local
      ansible_python_interpreter: "{{ansible_playbook_python}}"

      # User-provided values
      os_subnet_range: '10.0.0.0/16'
      os_flavor_master: 'my-bare-metal-flavor' 1
      os_flavor_worker: 'my-bare-metal-flavor' 2
      os_image_rhcos: 'rhcos'
      os_external_network: 'external'
...
```

If you want to have bare-metal control plane machines, change this value to a bare metal flavor.
Change this value to a bare metal flavor to use for compute machines.

Use the updated inventory.yaml file to complete the installation process.
Machines that are created during deployment use the flavor that you
added to the file.


[NOTE]
----
The installer may time out while waiting for bare metal machines to boot.
If the installer times out, restart and then complete the deployment by using the wait-for command of the installer. For example:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install wait-for install-complete --log-level debug
```

----

# Creating the bootstrap machine on RHOSP

Create a bootstrap machine and give it the network access it needs to run on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP). Red Hat provides an Ansible playbook that you run to simplify this process.

* You downloaded the modules in "Downloading playbook dependencies".
* You downloaded the playbooks in "Downloading the installation playbooks".
* The inventory.yaml, common.yaml, and bootstrap.yaml Ansible playbooks are in a common directory.
* The metadata.json file that the installation program created is in the same directory as the Ansible playbooks.

1. On a command line, change the working directory to the location of the playbooks.
2. On a command line, run the bootstrap.yaml playbook:

```terminal
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml bootstrap.yaml
```

3. After the bootstrap server is active, view the logs to verify that the Ignition files were received:

```terminal
$ openstack console log show "$INFRA_ID-bootstrap"
```


# Creating the control plane machines on RHOSP

Create three control plane machines by using the Ignition config files that you generated. Red Hat provides an Ansible playbook that you run to simplify this process.

* You downloaded the modules in "Downloading playbook dependencies".
* You downloaded the playbooks in "Downloading the installation playbooks".
* The infrastructure ID from the installation program's metadata file is set as an environment variable ($INFRA_ID).
* The inventory.yaml, common.yaml, and control-plane.yaml Ansible playbooks are in a common directory.
* You have the three Ignition files that were created in "Creating control plane Ignition config files".

1. On a command line, change the working directory to the location of the playbooks.
2. If the control plane Ignition config files are not already in your working directory, copy them into it.
3. On a command line, run the control-plane.yaml playbook:

```terminal
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml control-plane.yaml
```

4. Run the following command to monitor the bootstrapping process:

```terminal
$ openshift-install wait-for bootstrap-complete
```


You will see messages that confirm that the control plane machines are running and have joined the cluster:

```terminal
INFO API v1.30.3 up
INFO Waiting up to 30m0s for bootstrapping to complete...
...
INFO It is now safe to remove the bootstrap resources
```


# Logging in to the cluster by using the CLI

You can log in to your cluster as a default system user by exporting the cluster kubeconfig file.
The kubeconfig file contains information about the cluster that is used by the CLI to connect a client to the correct cluster and API server.
The file is specific to a cluster and is created during Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation.

* You deployed an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

1. Export the kubeadmin credentials by running the following command:

```terminal
$ export KUBECONFIG=<installation_directory>/auth/kubeconfig 1
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the path to the directory that you stored
the installation files in.
2. Verify you can run oc commands successfully using the exported configuration by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc whoami
```

Example output

```terminal
system:admin
```


# Deleting bootstrap resources from RHOSP

Delete the bootstrap resources that you no longer need.

* You downloaded the modules in "Downloading playbook dependencies".
* You downloaded the playbooks in "Downloading the installation playbooks".
* The inventory.yaml, common.yaml, and down-bootstrap.yaml Ansible playbooks are in a common directory.
* The control plane machines are running.
* If you do not know the status of the machines, see "Verifying cluster status".

1. On a command line, change the working directory to the location of the playbooks.
2. On a command line, run the down-bootstrap.yaml playbook:

```terminal
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml down-bootstrap.yaml
```


The bootstrap port, server, and floating IP address are deleted.


[WARNING]
----
If you did not disable the bootstrap Ignition file URL earlier, do so now.

# Creating compute machines on RHOSP

After standing up the control plane, create compute machines. Red Hat provides an Ansible playbook that you run to simplify this process.

* You downloaded the modules in "Downloading playbook dependencies".
* You downloaded the playbooks in "Downloading the installation playbooks".
* The inventory.yaml, common.yaml, and compute-nodes.yaml Ansible playbooks are in a common directory.
* The metadata.json file that the installation program created is in the same directory as the Ansible playbooks.
* The control plane is active.

1. On a command line, change the working directory to the location of the playbooks.
2. On a command line, run the playbook:

```terminal
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml compute-nodes.yaml
```


* Approve the certificate signing requests for the machines.

# Approving the certificate signing requests for your machines

When you add machines to a cluster, two pending certificate signing requests (CSRs) are generated for each machine that you added. You must confirm that these CSRs are approved or, if necessary, approve them yourself. The client requests must be approved first, followed by the server requests.

* You added machines to your cluster.

1. Confirm that the cluster recognizes the machines:

```terminal
$ oc get nodes
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME      STATUS    ROLES   AGE  VERSION
master-0  Ready     master  63m  v1.30.3
master-1  Ready     master  63m  v1.30.3
master-2  Ready     master  64m  v1.30.3
```


The output lists all of the machines that you created.

[NOTE]
----
The preceding output might not include the compute nodes, also known as worker nodes, until some CSRs are approved.
----
2. Review the pending CSRs and ensure that you see the client requests with the Pending or Approved status for each machine that you added to the cluster:

```terminal
$ oc get csr
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME        AGE     REQUESTOR                                                                   CONDITION
csr-8b2br   15m     system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Pending
csr-8vnps   15m     system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Pending
...
```


In this example, two machines are joining the cluster. You might see more approved CSRs in the list.
3. If the CSRs were not approved, after all of the pending CSRs for the machines you added are in Pending status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines:

[NOTE]
----
Because the CSRs rotate automatically, approve your CSRs within an hour of adding the machines to the cluster. If you do not approve them within an hour, the certificates will rotate, and more than two certificates will be present for each node. You must approve all of these certificates. After the client CSR is approved, the Kubelet creates a secondary CSR for the serving certificate, which requires manual approval. Then, subsequent serving certificate renewal requests are automatically approved by the machine-approver if the Kubelet requests a new certificate with identical parameters.
----

[NOTE]
----
For clusters running on platforms that are not machine API enabled, such as bare metal and other user-provisioned infrastructure, you must implement a method of automatically approving the kubelet serving certificate requests (CSRs). If a request is not approved, then the oc exec, oc rsh, and oc logs commands cannot succeed, because a serving certificate is required when the API server connects to the kubelet. Any operation that contacts the Kubelet endpoint requires this certificate approval to be in place. The method must watch for new CSRs, confirm that the CSR was submitted by the node-bootstrapper service account in the system:node or system:admin groups, and confirm the identity of the node.
----
* To approve them individually, run the following command for each valid CSR:

```terminal
$ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name> 1
```

<csr_name> is the name of a CSR from the list of current CSRs.
* To approve all pending CSRs, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs --no-run-if-empty oc adm certificate approve
```


[NOTE]
----
Some Operators might not become available until some CSRs are approved.
----
4. Now that your client requests are approved, you must review the server requests for each machine that you added to the cluster:

```terminal
$ oc get csr
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME        AGE     REQUESTOR                                                                   CONDITION
csr-bfd72   5m26s   system:node:ip-10-0-50-126.us-east-2.compute.internal                       Pending
csr-c57lv   5m26s   system:node:ip-10-0-95-157.us-east-2.compute.internal                       Pending
...
```

5. If the remaining CSRs are not approved, and are in the Pending status, approve the CSRs for your cluster machines:
* To approve them individually, run the following command for each valid CSR:

```terminal
$ oc adm certificate approve <csr_name> 1
```

<csr_name> is the name of a CSR from the list of current CSRs.
* To approve all pending CSRs, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs oc adm certificate approve
```

6. After all client and server CSRs have been approved, the machines have the Ready status. Verify this by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get nodes
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME      STATUS    ROLES   AGE  VERSION
master-0  Ready     master  73m  v1.30.3
master-1  Ready     master  73m  v1.30.3
master-2  Ready     master  74m  v1.30.3
worker-0  Ready     worker  11m  v1.30.3
worker-1  Ready     worker  11m  v1.30.3
```


[NOTE]
----
It can take a few minutes after approval of the server CSRs for the machines to transition to the Ready status.

# Verifying a successful installation

Verify that the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation is complete.

* You have the installation program (openshift-install)

* On a command line, enter:

```terminal
$ openshift-install --log-level debug wait-for install-complete
```


The program outputs the console URL, as well as the administrator&#8217;s login information.

# Telemetry access for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.17, the Telemetry service, which runs by default to provide metrics about cluster health and the success of updates, requires internet access. If your cluster is connected to the internet, Telemetry runs automatically, and your cluster is registered to OpenShift Cluster Manager.

After you confirm that your OpenShift Cluster Manager inventory is correct, either maintained automatically by Telemetry or manually by using OpenShift Cluster Manager, use subscription watch to track your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform subscriptions at the account or multi-cluster level.

* See About remote health monitoring for more information about the Telemetry service

# Next steps

* Customize your cluster.
* If necessary, you can
opt out of remote health reporting.
* If you need to enable external access to node ports, configure ingress cluster traffic by using a node port.
* If you did not configure RHOSP to accept application traffic over floating IP addresses, configure RHOSP access with floating IP addresses.
