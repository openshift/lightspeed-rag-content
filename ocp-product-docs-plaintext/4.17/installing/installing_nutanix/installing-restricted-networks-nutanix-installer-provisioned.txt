# Installing a cluster on Nutanix in a restricted network


In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.17, you can install a cluster on Nutanix infrastructure in a restricted network by creating an internal mirror of the installation release content.

# Prerequisites

* You have reviewed details about the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation and update processes.
* The installation program requires access to port 9440 on Prism Central and Prism Element. You verified that port 9440 is accessible.
* If you use a firewall, you have met these prerequisites:
* You confirmed that port 9440 is accessible. Control plane nodes must be able to reach Prism Central and Prism Element on port 9440 for the installation to succeed.
* You configured the firewall to grant access to the sites that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform requires. This includes the use of Telemetry.
* If your Nutanix environment is using the default self-signed SSL/TLS certificate, replace it with a certificate that is signed by a CA. The installation program requires a valid CA-signed certificate to access to the Prism Central API. For more information about replacing the self-signed certificate, see the  Nutanix AOS Security Guide.

If your Nutanix environment uses an internal CA to issue certificates, you must configure a cluster-wide proxy as part of the installation process. For more information, see Configuring a custom PKI.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Use 2048-bit certificates. The installation fails if you use 4096-bit certificates with Prism Central 2022.x.
----
* You have a container image registry, such as Red Hat Quay. If you do not already have a registry, you can create a mirror registry using  mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift.
* You have used the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI (oc) plugin to mirror all of the required Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform content and other images, including the Nutanix CSI Operator, to your mirror registry.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Because the installation media is on the mirror host, you can use that computer to complete all installation steps.
----

# About installations in restricted networks

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.17, you can perform an installation that does not
require an active connection to the internet to obtain software components. Restricted network installations can be completed using installer-provisioned infrastructure or user-provisioned infrastructure, depending on the cloud platform to which you are installing the cluster.

If you choose to perform a restricted network installation on a cloud platform, you
still require access to its cloud APIs. Some cloud functions, like
Amazon Web Service&#8217;s Route 53 DNS and IAM services, require internet access.
Depending on your network, you might require less internet
access for an installation on bare metal hardware, Nutanix, or on VMware vSphere.

To complete a restricted network installation, you must create a registry that
mirrors the contents of the OpenShift image registry and contains the
installation media. You can create this registry on a mirror host, which can
access both the internet and your closed network, or by using other methods
that meet your restrictions.

## Additional limits

Clusters in restricted networks have the following additional limitations and restrictions:

* The ClusterVersion status includes an Unable to retrieve available updates
error.
* By default, you cannot use the contents of the Developer Catalog because
you cannot access the required image stream tags.

# Generating a key pair for cluster node SSH access

During an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation, you can provide an SSH public key to the installation program. The key is passed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) nodes through their Ignition config files and is used to authenticate SSH access to the nodes. The key is added to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys list for the core user on each node, which enables password-less authentication.

After the key is passed to the nodes, you can use the key pair to SSH in to the RHCOS nodes as the user core. To access the nodes through SSH, the private key identity must be managed by SSH for your local user.

If you want to SSH in to your cluster nodes to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, you must provide the SSH public key during the installation process. The ./openshift-install gather command also requires the SSH public key to be in place on the cluster nodes.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not skip this procedure in production environments, where disaster recovery and debugging is required.
----


[NOTE]
----
You must use a local key, not one that you configured with platform-specific
approaches such as
AWS key pairs.
----

1. If you do not have an existing SSH key pair on your local machine to use for authentication onto your cluster nodes, create one. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

```terminal
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N '' -f <path>/<file_name> 1
```

Specify the path and file name, such as ~/.ssh/id_ed25519, of the new SSH key. If you have an existing key pair, ensure your public key is in the your ~/.ssh directory.

[NOTE]
----
If you plan to install an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster that uses the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures, do not create a key that uses the ed25519 algorithm. Instead, create a key that uses the rsa or ecdsa algorithm.
----
2. View the public SSH key:

```terminal
$ cat <path>/<file_name>.pub
```


For example, run the following to view the ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub public key:

```terminal
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

3. Add the SSH private key identity to the SSH agent for your local user, if it has not already been added. SSH agent management of the key is required for password-less SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes, or if you want to use the ./openshift-install gather command.

[NOTE]
----
On some distributions, default SSH private key identities such as ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_dsa are managed automatically.
----
1. If the ssh-agent process is not already running for your local user, start it as a background task:

```terminal
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

Example output

```terminal
Agent pid 31874
```


[NOTE]
----
If your cluster is in FIPS mode, only use FIPS-compliant algorithms to generate the SSH key. The key must be either RSA or ECDSA.
----
4. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent:

```terminal
$ ssh-add <path>/<file_name> 1
```

Specify the path and file name for your SSH private key, such as ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
Example output

```terminal
Identity added: /home/<you>/<path>/<file_name> (<computer_name>)
```


* When you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, provide the SSH public key to the installation program.

# Adding Nutanix root CA certificates to your system trust

Because the installation program requires access to the Prism Central API, you must add your Nutanix trusted root CA certificates to your system trust before you install an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

1. From the Prism Central web console, download the Nutanix root CA certificates.
2. Extract the compressed file that contains the Nutanix root CA certificates.
3. Add the files for your operating system to the system trust. For example, on a Fedora operating system, run the following command:

```terminal
# cp certs/lin/* /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors
```

4. Update your system trust. For example, on a Fedora operating system, run the following command:

```terminal
# update-ca-trust extract
```


# Downloading the RHCOS cluster image

Prism Central requires access to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) image to install the cluster. You can use the installation program to locate and download the RHCOS image and make it available through an internal HTTP server or Nutanix Objects.

* Obtain the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster. For a restricted network installation, these files are on your mirror host.

1. Change to the directory that contains the installation program and run the following command:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install coreos print-stream-json
```

2. Use the output of the command to find the location of the Nutanix image, and click the link to download it.
Example output

```terminal
"nutanix": {
  "release": "411.86.202210041459-0",
  "formats": {
    "qcow2": {
      "disk": {
        "location": "https://rhcos.mirror.openshift.com/art/storage/releases/rhcos-4.11/411.86.202210041459-0/x86_64/rhcos-411.86.202210041459-0-nutanix.x86_64.qcow2",
        "sha256": "42e227cac6f11ac37ee8a2f9528bb3665146566890577fd55f9b950949e5a54b"
```

3. Make the image available through an internal HTTP server or Nutanix Objects.
4. Note the location of the downloaded image. You update the platform section in the installation configuration file (install-config.yaml) with the image's location before deploying the cluster.


```yaml
platform:
  nutanix:
    clusterOSImage: http://example.com/images/rhcos-411.86.202210041459-0-nutanix.x86_64.qcow2
```


# Creating the installation configuration file

You can customize the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster you install on
Nutanix.

* You have the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.
For a restricted network installation, these files are on your mirror host.
* You have the imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml file that was created when you mirrored your registry.
* You have the location of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) image you download.
* You have obtained the contents of the certificate for your mirror registry.
* You have retrieved a Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) image and uploaded it to an accessible location.
* You have verified that you have met the Nutanix networking requirements. For more information, see "Preparing to install on Nutanix".

1. Create the install-config.yaml file.
1. Change to the directory that contains the installation program and run the following command:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install create install-config --dir <installation_directory> 1
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the directory name to store the
files that the installation program creates.

When specifying the directory:
* Verify that the directory has the execute permission. This permission is required to run Terraform binaries under the installation directory.
* Use an empty directory. Some installation assets, such as bootstrap X.509 certificates, have short expiration intervals, therefore you must not reuse an installation directory. If you want to reuse individual files from another cluster installation, you can copy them into your directory. However, the file names for the installation assets might change between releases. Use caution when copying installation files from an earlier Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version.
2. At the prompts, provide the configuration details for your cloud:
1. Optional: Select an SSH key to use to access your cluster machines.

[NOTE]
----
For production Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your ssh-agent process uses.
----
2. Select nutanix as the platform to target.
3. Enter the Prism Central domain name or IP address.
4. Enter the port that is used to log into Prism Central.
5. Enter the credentials that are used to log into Prism Central.

The installation program connects to Prism Central.
6. Select the Prism Element that will manage the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
7. Select the network subnet to use.
8. Enter the virtual IP address that you configured for control plane API access.
9. Enter the virtual IP address that you configured for cluster ingress.
10. Enter the base domain. This base domain must be the same one that you configured in the DNS records.
11. Enter a descriptive name for your cluster.

The cluster name you enter must match the cluster name you specified when configuring the DNS records.
2. In the install-config.yaml file, set the value of platform.nutanix.clusterOSImage to the image location or name. For example:

```yaml
platform:
  nutanix:
      clusterOSImage: http://mirror.example.com/images/rhcos-47.83.202103221318-0-nutanix.x86_64.qcow2
```

3. Edit the install-config.yaml file to give the additional information that is required for an installation in a restricted network.
1. Update the pullSecret value to contain the authentication information for
your registry:

```yaml
pullSecret: '{"auths":{"<mirror_host_name>:5000": {"auth": "<credentials>","email": "you@example.com"}}}'
```


For <mirror_host_name>, specify the registry domain name
that you specified in the certificate for your mirror registry, and for
<credentials>, specify the base64-encoded user name and password for
your mirror registry.
2. Add the additionalTrustBundle parameter and value.

```yaml
additionalTrustBundle: |
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```


The value must be the contents of the certificate file that you used for your mirror registry. The certificate file can be an existing, trusted certificate authority, or the self-signed certificate that you generated for the mirror registry.
3. Add the image content resources, which resemble the following YAML excerpt:

```yaml
imageContentSources:
- mirrors:
  - <mirror_host_name>:5000/<repo_name>/release
  source: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release
- mirrors:
  - <mirror_host_name>:5000/<repo_name>/release
  source: registry.redhat.io/ocp/release
```


For these values, use the imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml file that was created when you mirrored the registry.
4. Optional: Set the publishing strategy to Internal:

```yaml
publish: Internal
```


By setting this option, you create an internal Ingress Controller and a private load balancer.
4. Optional: Update one or more of the default configuration parameters in the install.config.yaml file to customize the installation.

For more information about the parameters, see "Installation configuration parameters".

[NOTE]
----
If you are installing a three-node cluster, be sure to set the compute.replicas parameter to 0. This ensures that cluster's control planes are schedulable. For more information, see "Installing a three-node cluster on {platform}".
----
5. Back up the install-config.yaml file so that you can use
it to install multiple clusters.

[IMPORTANT]
----
The install-config.yaml file is consumed during the installation process. If
you want to reuse the file, you must back it up now.
----

Required. The installation program prompts you for this value.
The controlPlane section is a single mapping, but the compute section is a sequence of mappings. To meet the requirements of the different data structures, the first line of the compute section must begin with a hyphen, -, and the first line of the controlPlane section must not. Although both sections currently define a single machine pool, it is possible that future versions of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform will support defining multiple compute pools during installation. Only one control plane pool is used.
Whether to enable or disable simultaneous multithreading, or hyperthreading. By default, simultaneous multithreading is enabled to increase the performance of your machines' cores. You can disable it by setting the parameter value to Disabled. If you disable simultaneous multithreading in some cluster machines, you must disable it in all cluster machines.

[IMPORTANT]
----
If you disable simultaneous multithreading, ensure that your capacity planning accounts for the dramatically decreased machine performance.
----
Optional: Provide additional configuration for the machine pool parameters for the compute and control plane machines.
Optional: Provide one or more pairs of a prism category key and a prism category value. These category key-value pairs must exist in Prism Central. You can provide separate categories to compute machines, control plane machines, or all machines.
The cluster network plugin to install. The default value OVNKubernetes is the only supported value.
Optional: Specify a project with which VMs are associated. Specify either name or uuid for the project type, and then provide the corresponding UUID or project name. You can associate projects to compute machines, control plane machines, or all machines.
Optional: By default, the installation program downloads and installs the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) image. If Prism Central does not have internet access, you can override the default behavior by hosting the RHCOS image on any HTTP server or Nutanix Objects and pointing the installation program to the image.
For <local_registry>, specify the registry domain name, and optionally the port, that your mirror registry uses to serve content. For example registry.example.com or registry.example.com:5000. For <credentials>,
specify the base64-encoded user name and password for your mirror registry.
Whether to enable or disable FIPS mode. By default, FIPS mode is not enabled. If FIPS mode is enabled, the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform runs on bypass the default Kubernetes cryptography suite and use the cryptography modules that are provided with RHCOS instead.

[IMPORTANT]
----
When running Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) booted in FIPS mode, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform core components use the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures.
----
Optional: You can provide the sshKey value that you use to access the machines in your cluster.

[NOTE]
----
For production Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your ssh-agent process uses.
----
Provide the contents of the certificate file that you used for your mirror registry.
Provide these values from the metadata.name: release-0 section of the imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml file that was created when you mirrored the registry.

## Configuring failure domains

Failure domains improve the fault tolerance of an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster by distributing control plane and compute machines across multiple Nutanix Prism Elements (clusters).


[TIP]
----
It is recommended that you configure three failure domains to ensure high-availability.
----

* You have an installation configuration file (install-config.yaml).

1. Edit the install-config.yaml file and add the following stanza to configure the first failure domain:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
compute:
# ...
platform:
  nutanix:
    failureDomains:
    - name: <failure_domain_name>
      prismElement:
        name: <prism_element_name>
        uuid: <prism_element_uuid>
      subnetUUIDs:
      - <network_uuid>
# ...
```


where:
<failure_domain_name>:: Specifies a unique name for the failure domain. The name is limited to 64 or fewer characters, which can include lower-case letters, digits, and a dash (-). The dash cannot be in the leading or ending position of the name.
<prism_element_name>:: Optional. Specifies the name of the Prism Element.
<prism_element_uuid>:: Specifies the UUID of the Prism Element.
<network_uuid>:: Specifies the UUID of the Prism Element subnet object. The subnet's IP address prefix (CIDR) should contain the virtual IP addresses that the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster uses. Only one subnet per failure domain (Prism Element) in an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster is supported.
2. As required, configure additional failure domains.
3. To distribute control plane and compute machines across the failure domains, do one of the following:
* If compute and control plane machines can share the same set of failure domains, add the failure domain names under the cluster's default machine configuration.
Example of control plane and compute machines sharing a set of failure domains

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
compute:
# ...
platform:
  nutanix:
    defaultMachinePlatform:
      failureDomains:
        - failure-domain-1
        - failure-domain-2
        - failure-domain-3
# ...
```

* If compute and control plane machines must use different failure domains, add the failure domain names under the respective machine pools.
Example of control plane and compute machines using different failure domains

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
compute:
# ...
controlPlane:
  platform:
    nutanix:
      failureDomains:
        - failure-domain-1
        - failure-domain-2
        - failure-domain-3
# ...
compute:
  platform:
    nutanix:
      failureDomains:
        - failure-domain-1
        - failure-domain-2
# ...
```

4. Save the file.

## Configuring the cluster-wide proxy during installation

Production environments can deny direct access to the internet and instead have
an HTTP or HTTPS proxy available. You can configure a new Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
cluster to use a proxy by configuring the proxy settings in the
install-config.yaml file.

* You have an existing install-config.yaml file.
* You reviewed the sites that your cluster requires access to and determined whether any of them need to bypass the proxy. By default, all cluster egress traffic is proxied, including calls to hosting cloud provider APIs. You added sites to the Proxy object's spec.noProxy field to bypass the proxy if necessary.

[NOTE]
----
The Proxy object status.noProxy field is populated with the values of the networking.machineNetwork[].cidr, networking.clusterNetwork[].cidr, and networking.serviceNetwork[] fields from your installation configuration.
For installations on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, and Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP), the Proxy object status.noProxy field is also populated with the instance metadata endpoint (169.254.169.254).
----

1. Edit your install-config.yaml file and add the proxy settings. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: my.domain.com
proxy:
  httpProxy: http://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port> 1
  httpsProxy: https://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port> 2
  noProxy: example.com 3
additionalTrustBundle: | 4
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    <MY_TRUSTED_CA_CERT>
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
additionalTrustBundlePolicy: <policy_to_add_additionalTrustBundle> 5
```

A proxy URL to use for creating HTTP connections outside the cluster. The
URL scheme must be http.
A proxy URL to use for creating HTTPS connections outside the cluster.
A comma-separated list of destination domain names, IP addresses, or other network CIDRs to exclude from proxying. Preface a domain with . to match subdomains only. For example, .y.com matches x.y.com, but not y.com. Use * to bypass the proxy for all destinations.
If provided, the installation program generates a config map that is named user-ca-bundle in
the openshift-config namespace that contains one or more additional CA
certificates that are required for proxying HTTPS connections. The Cluster Network
Operator then creates a trusted-ca-bundle config map that merges these contents
with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) trust bundle, and this config map is referenced in the trustedCA field of the Proxy object. The additionalTrustBundle field is required unless
the proxy's identity certificate is signed by an authority from the RHCOS trust
bundle.
Optional: The policy to determine the configuration of the Proxy object to reference the user-ca-bundle config map in the trustedCA field. The allowed values are Proxyonly and Always. Use Proxyonly to reference the user-ca-bundle config map only when http/https proxy is configured. Use Always to always reference the user-ca-bundle config map. The default value is Proxyonly.

[NOTE]
----
The installation program does not support the proxy readinessEndpoints field.
----

[NOTE]
----
If the installer times out, restart and then complete the deployment by using the wait-for command of the installer. For example:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install wait-for install-complete --log-level debug
```

----
2. Save the file and reference it when installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

The installation program creates a cluster-wide proxy that is named cluster that uses the proxy
settings in the provided install-config.yaml file. If no proxy settings are
provided, a cluster Proxy object is still created, but it will have a nil
spec.


[NOTE]
----
Only the Proxy object named cluster is supported, and no additional
proxies can be created.

To check your PATH, open the command prompt and execute the following command:

```terminal
C:\> path
```


* After you install the OpenShift CLI, it is available using the oc command:

```terminal
C:\> oc <command>
```


## Installing the OpenShift CLI on macOS

You can install the OpenShift CLI (oc) binary on macOS by using the following procedure.

1. Navigate to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform downloads page on the Red Hat Customer Portal.
2. Select the appropriate version from the Version drop-down list.
3. Click Download Now next to the OpenShift v4.17 macOS Clients entry and save the file.

[NOTE]
----
For macOS arm64, choose the OpenShift v4.17 macOS arm64 Client entry.
----
4. Unpack and unzip the archive.
5. Move the oc binary to a directory on your PATH.

To check your PATH, open a terminal and execute the following command:

```terminal
$ echo $PATH
```


* Verify your installation by using an oc command:

```terminal
$ oc <command>
```


# Configuring IAM for Nutanix

Installing the cluster requires that the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) operate in manual mode. While the installation program configures the CCO for manual mode, you must specify the identity and access management secrets.

* You have configured the ccoctl binary.
* You have an install-config.yaml file.

1. Create a YAML file that contains the credentials data in the following format:
Credentials data format

```yaml
credentials:
- type: basic_auth 1
  data:
    prismCentral: 2
      username: <username_for_prism_central>
      password: <password_for_prism_central>
    prismElements: 3
    - name: <name_of_prism_element>
      username: <username_for_prism_element>
      password: <password_for_prism_element>
```

Specify the authentication type. Only basic authentication is supported.
Specify the Prism Central credentials.
Optional: Specify the Prism Element credentials.
2. Set a $RELEASE_IMAGE variable with the release image from your installation file by running the following command:

```terminal
$ RELEASE_IMAGE=$(./openshift-install version | awk '/release image/ {print $3}')
```

3. Extract the list of CredentialsRequest custom resources (CRs) from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc adm release extract \
  --from=$RELEASE_IMAGE \
  --credentials-requests \
  --included \1
  --install-config=<path_to_directory_with_installation_configuration>/install-config.yaml \2
  --to=<path_to_directory_for_credentials_requests> 3
```

The --included parameter includes only the manifests that your specific cluster configuration requires.
Specify the location of the install-config.yaml file.
Specify the path to the directory where you want to store the CredentialsRequest objects. If the specified directory does not exist, this command creates it.
Sample CredentialsRequest object

```yaml
  apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
  kind: CredentialsRequest
  metadata:
    annotations:
      include.release.openshift.io/self-managed-high-availability: "true"
    labels:
      controller-tools.k8s.io: "1.0"
    name: openshift-machine-api-nutanix
    namespace: openshift-cloud-credential-operator
  spec:
    providerSpec:
      apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
      kind: NutanixProviderSpec
    secretRef:
      name: nutanix-credentials
      namespace: openshift-machine-api
```

4. Use the ccoctl tool to process all CredentialsRequest objects by running the following command:

```terminal
$ ccoctl nutanix create-shared-secrets \
  --credentials-requests-dir=<path_to_credentials_requests_directory> \1
  --output-dir=<ccoctl_output_dir> \2
  --credentials-source-filepath=<path_to_credentials_file> 3
```

Specify the path to the directory that contains the files for the component CredentialsRequests objects.
Optional: Specify the directory in which you want the ccoctl utility to create objects. By default, the utility creates objects in the directory in which the commands are run.
Optional: Specify the directory that contains the credentials data YAML file. By default, ccoctl expects this file to be in <home_directory>/.nutanix/credentials.
5. Edit the install-config.yaml configuration file so that the credentialsMode parameter is set to Manual.
Example install-config.yaml configuration file

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: cluster1.example.com
credentialsMode: Manual 1
...
```

Add this line to set the credentialsMode parameter to Manual.
6. Create the installation manifests by running the following command:

```terminal
$ openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory> 1
```

Specify the path to the directory that contains the install-config.yaml file for your cluster.
7. Copy the generated credential files to the target manifests directory by running the following command:

```terminal
$ cp <ccoctl_output_dir>/manifests/*credentials.yaml ./<installation_directory>/manifests
```


* Ensure that the appropriate secrets exist in the manifests directory.

```terminal
$ ls ./<installation_directory>/manifests
```

Example output

```text
cluster-config.yaml
cluster-dns-02-config.yml
cluster-infrastructure-02-config.yml
cluster-ingress-02-config.yml
cluster-network-01-crd.yml
cluster-network-02-config.yml
cluster-proxy-01-config.yaml
cluster-scheduler-02-config.yml
cvo-overrides.yaml
kube-cloud-config.yaml
kube-system-configmap-root-ca.yaml
machine-config-server-tls-secret.yaml
openshift-config-secret-pull-secret.yaml

openshift-machine-api-nutanix-credentials-credentials.yaml
```


# Deploying the cluster

You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on a compatible cloud platform.


[IMPORTANT]
----
You can run the create cluster command of the installation program only once, during initial installation.
----

* You have the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.
* You have verified that the cloud provider account on your host has the correct permissions to deploy the cluster. An account with incorrect permissions causes the installation process to fail with an error message that displays the missing permissions.

* In the directory that contains the installation program, initialize the cluster deployment by running the following command:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install create cluster --dir <installation_directory> \ 1
    --log-level=info 2
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the
location of your customized ./install-config.yaml file.
To view different installation details, specify warn, debug, or
error instead of info.

When the cluster deployment completes successfully:

* The terminal displays directions for accessing your cluster, including a link to the web console and credentials for the kubeadmin user.
* Credential information also outputs to <installation_directory>/.openshift_install.log.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not delete the installation program or the files that the installation program creates. Both are required to delete the cluster.
----


```terminal
...
INFO Install complete!
INFO To access the cluster as the system:admin user when using 'oc', run 'export KUBECONFIG=/home/myuser/install_dir/auth/kubeconfig'
INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.mycluster.example.com
INFO Login to the console with user: "kubeadmin", and password: "password"
INFO Time elapsed: 36m22s
```



[IMPORTANT]
----
* The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending node-bootstrapper certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for Recovering from expired control plane certificates for more information.
* It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.
----

# Post installation

Complete the following steps to complete the configuration of your cluster.

## Disabling the default OperatorHub catalog sources

Operator catalogs that source content provided by Red Hat and community projects are configured for OperatorHub by default during an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation.
In a restricted network environment, you must disable the default catalogs as a cluster administrator.

* Disable the sources for the default catalogs by adding disableAllDefaultSources: true to the OperatorHub object:

```terminal
$ oc patch OperatorHub cluster --type json \
    -p '[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/disableAllDefaultSources", "value": true}]'
```



[TIP]
----
Alternatively, you can use the web console to manage catalog sources. From the Administration -> Cluster Settings -> Configuration -> OperatorHub page, click the Sources tab, where you can create, update, delete, disable, and enable individual sources.
----

## Installing the policy resources into the cluster

Mirroring the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform content using the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI (oc) plugin creates resources, which include catalogSource-certified-operator-index.yaml and imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml.

* The ImageContentSourcePolicy resource associates the mirror registry with the source registry and redirects image pull requests from the online registries to the mirror registry.
* The CatalogSource resource is used by Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to retrieve information about the available Operators in the mirror registry, which lets users discover and install Operators.

After you install the cluster, you must install these resources into the cluster.

* You have mirrored the image set to the registry mirror in the disconnected environment.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

1. Log in to the OpenShift CLI as a user with the cluster-admin role.
2. Apply the YAML files from the results directory to the cluster:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f ./oc-mirror-workspace/results-<id>/
```


1. Verify that the ImageContentSourcePolicy resources were successfully installed:

```terminal
$ oc get imagecontentsourcepolicy
```

2. Verify that the CatalogSource resources were successfully installed:

```terminal
$ oc get catalogsource --all-namespaces
```


## Configuring the default storage container

After you install the cluster, you must install the Nutanix CSI Operator and configure the default storage container for the cluster.

For more information, see the Nutanix documentation for installing the CSI Operator and configuring registry storage.

# Telemetry access for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.17, the Telemetry service, which runs by default to provide metrics about cluster health and the success of updates, requires internet access. If your cluster is connected to the internet, Telemetry runs automatically, and your cluster is registered to OpenShift Cluster Manager.

After you confirm that your OpenShift Cluster Manager inventory is correct, either maintained automatically by Telemetry or manually by using OpenShift Cluster Manager, use subscription watch to track your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform subscriptions at the account or multi-cluster level.
