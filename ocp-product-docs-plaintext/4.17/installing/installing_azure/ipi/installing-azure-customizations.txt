# Installing a cluster on Azure with customizations


You can install a customized cluster on infrastructure that the installation program provisions on Microsoft Azure. To customize the installation, modify parameters in the install-config.yaml file before you install the cluster.

# Using the Azure Marketplace offering

Using the Azure Marketplace offering lets you deploy an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, which is billed on pay-per-use basis (hourly, per core) through Azure, while still being supported directly by Red&#160;Hat.

To deploy an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster using the Azure Marketplace offering, you must first obtain the Azure Marketplace image. The installation program uses this image to deploy worker or control plane nodes. When obtaining your image, consider the following:

* While the images are the same, the Azure Marketplace publisher is different depending on your region. If you are located in North America, specify redhat as the publisher. If you are located in EMEA, specify redhat-limited as the publisher.
* The offer includes a rh-ocp-worker SKU and a rh-ocp-worker-gen1 SKU. The rh-ocp-worker SKU represents a Hyper-V generation version 2 VM image. The default instance types used in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform are version 2 compatible. If you plan to use an instance type that is only version 1 compatible, use the image associated with the rh-ocp-worker-gen1 SKU. The rh-ocp-worker-gen1 SKU represents a Hyper-V version 1 VM image.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Installing images with the Azure marketplace is not supported on clusters with 64-bit ARM instances.
You should only modify the RHCOS image for compute machines to use {platform-abbreviation} Marketplace image. Control plane machines and infrastructure nodes do not require an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform subscription and use the public RHCOS default image by default, which does not incur subscription costs on your {platform-abbreviation-short} bill. Therefore, you should not modify the cluster default boot image or the control plane boot images. Applying the {platform-abbreviation-short} Marketplace image to them will incur additional licensing costs that cannot be recovered.
----

* You have installed the Azure CLI client (az).
* Your Azure account is entitled for the offer and you have logged into this account with the Azure CLI client.

1. Display all of the available Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform images by running one of the following commands:
* North America:

```terminal
$  az vm image list --all --offer rh-ocp-worker --publisher redhat -o table
```

Example output

```terminal
Offer          Publisher       Sku                 Urn                                                             Version

```

[NOTE]
----
Use the latest image that is available for compute and control plane nodes. If required, your VMs are automatically upgraded as part of the installation process.
----
2. Inspect the image for your offer by running one of the following commands:
* North America:

```terminal
$ az vm image show --urn redhat:rh-ocp-worker:rh-ocp-worker:<version>
```

* EMEA:

```terminal
$ az vm image show --urn redhat-limited:rh-ocp-worker:rh-ocp-worker:<version>
```

3. Review the terms of the offer by running one of the following commands:
* North America:

```terminal
$ az vm image terms show --urn redhat:rh-ocp-worker:rh-ocp-worker:<version>
```

* EMEA:

```terminal
$ az vm image terms show --urn redhat-limited:rh-ocp-worker:rh-ocp-worker:<version>
```

4. Accept the terms of the offering by running one of the following commands:
* North America:

```terminal
$ az vm image terms accept --urn redhat:rh-ocp-worker:rh-ocp-worker:<version>
```

* EMEA:

```terminal
$ az vm image terms accept --urn redhat-limited:rh-ocp-worker:rh-ocp-worker:<version>
```

5. Record the image details of your offer. You must update the compute section in the install-config.yaml file with values for publisher, offer, sku, and version before deploying the cluster. You may also update the controlPlane section to deploy control plane machines with the specified image details, or the defaultMachinePlatform section to deploy both control plane and compute machines with the specified image details. Use the latest available image for control plane and compute nodes.


```yaml
apiVersion: v1

# Creating the installation configuration file

You can customize the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster you install on
Microsoft Azure.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not specify windows, microsoft, or other variants of these words in the metadata.name parameter of the install-config.yaml file. Specifying one of these words for the cluster name causes the installation program to generate an error message like the following example message:

```terminal
The resource name 'windows-xxxx-identity' or a part of the name is a trademarked or reserved word.
```

Additionally, specifying login at the beginning of the name in the metadata.name parameter of the install-config.yaml file results in the generation of an error message. You can specify login in the middle or end of the name.
----

* You have the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.
* You have an Azure subscription ID and tenant ID.
* If you are installing the cluster using a service principal, you have its application ID and password.
* If you are installing the cluster using a system-assigned managed identity, you have enabled it on the virtual machine that you will run the installation program from.
* If you are installing the cluster using a user-assigned managed identity, you have met these prerequisites:
* You have its client ID.
* You have assigned it to the virtual machine that you will run the installation program from.

1. Optional: If you have run the installation program on this computer before, and want to use an alternative service principal or managed identity, go to the ~/.azure/ directory and delete the osServicePrincipal.json configuration file.

Deleting this file prevents the installation program from automatically reusing subscription and authentication values from a previous installation.
2. Create the install-config.yaml file.
1. Change to the directory that contains the installation program and run the following command:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install create install-config --dir <installation_directory>
```

* <installation_directory>: For <installation_directory>, specify the directory name to store the
files that the installation program creates.

When specifying the directory:
* Verify that the directory has the execute permission. This permission is required to run Terraform binaries under the installation directory.
* Use an empty directory. Some installation assets, such as bootstrap X.509 certificates, have short expiration intervals, therefore you must not reuse an installation directory. If you want to reuse individual files from another cluster installation, you can copy them into your directory. However, the file names for the installation assets might change between releases. Use caution when copying installation files from an earlier Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version.
2. At the prompts, provide the configuration details for your cloud:
1. Optional: Select an SSH key to use to access your cluster machines.

[NOTE]
----
For production Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your ssh-agent process uses.
----
2. Select azure as the platform to target.

If the installation program cannot locate the osServicePrincipal.json configuration file from a previous installation, you are prompted for Azure subscription and authentication values.
3. Enter the following Azure parameter values for your subscription:
* azure subscription id: Enter the subscription ID to use for the cluster.
* azure tenant id: Enter the tenant ID.
4. Depending on the Azure identity you are using to deploy the cluster, do one of the following when prompted for the azure service principal client id:
* If you are using a service principal, enter its application ID.
* If you are using a system-assigned managed identity, leave this value blank.
* If you are using a user-assigned managed identity, specify its client ID.
5. Depending on the Azure identity you are using to deploy the cluster, do one of the following when prompted for the azure service principal client secret:
* If you are using a service principal, enter its password.
* If you are using a system-assigned managed identity, leave this value blank.
* If you are using a user-assigned managed identity, leave this value blank.
6. Select the region to deploy the cluster to.
7. Select the base domain to deploy the cluster to. The base domain corresponds
to the Azure DNS Zone that you created for your cluster.
8. Enter a descriptive name for your cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
----
All Azure resources that are available through public endpoints are subject to resource name restrictions, and you cannot create resources that use certain terms. For a list of terms that Azure restricts, see Resolve reserved resource name errors in the Azure documentation.
----
3. Modify the install-config.yaml file. You can find more information about the available parameters in the "Installation configuration parameters" section.

[NOTE]
----
If you are installing a three-node cluster, be sure to set the compute.replicas parameter to 0. This ensures that the cluster's control planes are schedulable. For more information, see "Installing a three-node cluster on Azure".
----
4. Back up the install-config.yaml file so that you can use
it to install multiple clusters.

[IMPORTANT]
----
The install-config.yaml file is consumed during the installation process. If
you want to reuse the file, you must back it up now.
----

If previously not detected, the installation program creates an osServicePrincipal.json configuration file and stores this file in the ~/.azure/ directory on your computer. This ensures that the installation program can load the profile when it is creating an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on the target platform.

* Installation configuration parameters for Azure

## Minimum resource requirements for cluster installation

Each created cluster must meet minimum requirements so that the cluster runs as expected.



1. One vCPU is equivalent to one physical core when simultaneous multithreading (SMT), or Hyper-Threading, is not enabled. When enabled, use the following formula to calculate the corresponding ratio: (threads per core × cores) × sockets = vCPUs.
2. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and Kubernetes are sensitive to disk performance, and faster storage is recommended, particularly for etcd on the control plane nodes which require a 10 ms p99 fsync duration. Note that on many cloud platforms, storage size and IOPS scale together, so you might need to over-allocate storage volume to obtain sufficient performance.
3. As with all user-provisioned installations, if you choose to use RHEL compute machines in your cluster, you take responsibility for all operating system life cycle management and maintenance, including performing system updates, applying patches, and completing all other required tasks. Use of RHEL 7 compute machines is deprecated and has been removed in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 and later.


[NOTE]
----
As of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.13, RHCOS is based on RHEL version 9.2, which updates the micro-architecture requirements. The following list contains the minimum instruction set architectures (ISA) that each architecture requires:
* x86-64 architecture requires x86-64-v2 ISA
* ARM64 architecture requires ARMv8.0-A ISA
* IBM Power architecture requires Power 9 ISA
* s390x architecture requires z14 ISA
For more information, see Architectures (RHEL documentation).
----


[IMPORTANT]
----
You are required to use Azure virtual machines that have the premiumIO parameter set to true.
----

If an instance type for your platform meets the minimum requirements for cluster machines, it is supported to use in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

Required. The installation program prompts you for this value.
If you do not provide these parameters and values, the installation program provides the default value.
The controlPlane section is a single mapping, but the compute section is a sequence of mappings. To meet the requirements of the different data structures, the first line of the compute section must begin with a hyphen, -, and the first line of the controlPlane section must not. Only one control plane pool is used.
Whether to enable or disable simultaneous multithreading, or hyperthreading. By default, simultaneous multithreading is enabled to increase the performance of your machines' cores. You can disable it by setting the parameter value to Disabled. If you disable simultaneous multithreading in some cluster machines, you must disable it in all cluster machines.

[IMPORTANT]
----
If you disable simultaneous multithreading, ensure that your capacity planning accounts for the dramatically decreased machine performance. Use larger virtual machine types, such as Standard_D8s_v3, for your machines if you disable simultaneous multithreading.
----
You can specify the size of the disk to use in GB. Minimum recommendation for control plane nodes is 1024 GB.
Specify a list of zones to deploy your machines to. For high availability, specify at least two zones.
The cluster network plugin to install. The default value OVNKubernetes is the only supported value.
Optional: A custom Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) image that should be used to boot control plane and compute machines. The publisher, offer, sku, and version parameters under platform.azure.defaultMachinePlatform.osImage apply to both control plane and compute machines. If the parameters under controlPlane.platform.azure.osImage or compute.platform.azure.osImage are set, they override the platform.azure.defaultMachinePlatform.osImage parameters.
Specify the name of the resource group that contains the DNS zone for your base domain.
Specify the name of an already existing resource group to install your cluster to. If undefined, a new resource group is created for the cluster.
Whether to enable or disable FIPS mode. By default, FIPS mode is not enabled. If FIPS mode is enabled, the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform runs on bypass the default Kubernetes cryptography suite and use the cryptography modules that are provided with RHCOS instead.

[IMPORTANT]
----
To enable FIPS mode for your cluster, you must run the installation program from a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) computer configured to operate in FIPS mode. For more information about configuring FIPS mode on RHEL, see Switching RHEL to FIPS mode.
When running Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) booted in FIPS mode, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform core components use the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures.
----
You can optionally provide the sshKey value that you use to access the machines in your cluster.

[NOTE]
----
For production Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your ssh-agent process uses.
----

## Configuring the cluster-wide proxy during installation

To enable internet access in environments that deny direct connections, configure a cluster-wide proxy in the install-config.yaml file. This configuration ensures that the new Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster routes traffic through the specified HTTP or HTTPS proxy.

* You have an existing install-config.yaml file.
* You have reviewed the sites that your cluster requires access to and determined whether any of them need to bypass the proxy. By default, all cluster egress traffic is proxied, including calls to hosting cloud provider APIs. You added sites to the Proxy object's spec.noProxy field to bypass the proxy if necessary.

[NOTE]
----
The Proxy object status.noProxy field is populated with the values of the networking.machineNetwork[].cidr, networking.clusterNetwork[].cidr, and networking.serviceNetwork[] fields from your installation configuration.
For installations on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, and Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP), the Proxy object status.noProxy field is also populated with the instance metadata endpoint (169.254.169.254).
----

1. Edit your install-config.yaml file and add the proxy settings. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: my.domain.com
proxy:
  httpProxy: http://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port>
  httpsProxy: https://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port>
  noProxy: example.com
additionalTrustBundle: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    <MY_TRUSTED_CA_CERT>
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
additionalTrustBundlePolicy: <policy_to_add_additionalTrustBundle>
# ...
```


where:
proxy.httpProxy:: Specifies a proxy URL to use for creating HTTP connections outside the cluster. The URL scheme must be http.
proxy.httpsProxy:: Specifies a proxy URL to use for creating HTTPS connections outside the cluster.
proxy.noProxy:: Specifies a comma-separated list of destination domain names, IP addresses, or other network CIDRs to exclude from proxying. Preface a domain with . to match subdomains only. For example, .y.com matches x.y.com, but not y.com. Use * to bypass the proxy for all destinations.
additionalTrustBundle:: If provided, the installation program generates a config map that is named user-ca-bundle in the openshift-config namespace to hold the additional CA certificates. If you provide additionalTrustBundle and at least one proxy setting, the Proxy object is configured to reference the user-ca-bundle config map in the trustedCA field. The Cluster Network Operator then creates a trusted-ca-bundle config map that merges the contents specified for the trustedCA parameter with the RHCOS trust bundle. The additionalTrustBundle field is required unless the proxy's identity certificate is signed by an authority from the RHCOS trust bundle.
additionalTrustBundlePolicy:: Specifies the policy that determines the configuration of the Proxy object to reference the user-ca-bundle config map in the trustedCA field. The allowed values are Proxyonly and Always. Use Proxyonly to reference the user-ca-bundle config map only when http/https proxy is configured. Use Always to always reference the user-ca-bundle config map. The default value is Proxyonly. Optional parameter.

[NOTE]
----
The installation program does not support the proxy readinessEndpoints field.
----

[NOTE]
----
If the installer times out, restart and then complete the deployment by using the wait-for command of the installer. For example:
+

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install wait-for install-complete --log-level debug
```

----
2. Save the file and reference it when installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

The installation program creates a cluster-wide proxy that is named cluster that uses the proxy settings in the provided install-config.yaml file. If no proxy settings are provided, a cluster Proxy object is still created, but it will have a nil spec.

[NOTE]
----
Only the Proxy object named cluster is supported, and no additional proxies can be created.

# Configuring user-defined tags for Azure

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, you can use tags for grouping resources and for managing resource access and cost. Tags are applied only to the resources created by the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program and its core Operators such as Machine API Operator, Cluster Ingress Operator, Cluster Image Registry Operator. The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform consists of the following types of tags:

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform tags:: By default, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program attaches the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform tags to the Azure resources. These Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform tags are not accessible to the users. The format of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform tags is kubernetes.io_cluster.<cluster_id>:owned, where <cluster_id> is the value of .status.infrastructureName in the infrastructure resource for the cluster.
User-defined tags:: User-defined tags are manually created in install-config.yaml file during installation. When creating the user-defined tags, you must consider the following points:
* User-defined tags on Azure resources can only be defined during Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster creation, and cannot be modified after the cluster is created.
* Support for user-defined tags is available only for the resources created in the Azure Public Cloud.
* User-defined tags are not supported for the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters upgraded to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.17.

## Creating user-defined tags for Azure

To define the list of user-defined tags, edit the .platform.azure.userTags field in the install-config.yaml file.

* Specify the .platform.azure.userTags field as shown in the following install-config.yaml file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
#...
platform:
  azure:
    userTags: 1
      <key>: <value> 2
#...
```

Defines the additional keys and values that the installation program adds as tags to all Azure resources that it creates.
Specify the key and value. You can configure a maximum of 10 tags for resource group and resources. Tag keys are case-insensitive. For more information on requirements for specifying user-defined tags, see "User-defined tags requirements" section.
Example install-config.yaml file

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
#...
platform:
  azure:
    userTags:
      createdBy: user
      environment: dev
#...
```


* Access the list of created user-defined tags for the Azure resources by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get infrastructures.config.openshift.io cluster -o=jsonpath-as-json='{.status.platformStatus.azure.resourceTags}'
```

Example output

```json
[
    [
        {
            "key": "createdBy",
            "value": "user"
        },
        {
            "key": "environment",
            "value": "dev"
        }
    ]
]
```


## User-defined tags requirements

The user-defined tags have the following requirements:

* A tag key must have a maximum of 128 characters.
* A tag key must begin with a letter.
* A tag key must end with a letter, number or underscore.
* A tag key must contain only letters, numbers, underscores(_), periods(.), and hyphens(-).
* A tag key must not be specified as name.
* A tag key must not have the following prefixes:
* kubernetes.io
* openshift.io
* microsoft
* azure
* windows
* A tag value must have a maximum of 256 characters.

For more information about Azure tags, see Azure user-defined tags.

# Alternatives to storing administrator-level secrets in the kube-system project

By default, administrator secrets are stored in the kube-system project. If you configured the credentialsMode parameter in the install-config.yaml file to Manual, you must use one of the following alternatives:

* To manage long-term cloud credentials manually, follow the procedure in Manually creating long-term credentials.
* To implement short-term credentials that are managed outside the cluster for individual components, follow the procedures in Configuring an Azure cluster to use short-term credentials.

## Manually creating long-term credentials

The Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) can be put into manual mode prior to installation in environments where the cloud identity and access management (IAM) APIs are not reachable, or the administrator prefers not to store an administrator-level credential secret in the cluster kube-system namespace.

1. If you did not set the credentialsMode parameter in the install-config.yaml configuration file to Manual, modify the value as shown:
Sample configuration file snippet

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
credentialsMode: Manual
# ...
```

2. If you have not previously created installation manifest files, do so by running the following command:

```terminal
$ openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory>
```


where <installation_directory> is the directory in which the installation program creates files.
3. Set a $RELEASE_IMAGE variable with the release image from your installation file by running the following command:

```terminal
$ RELEASE_IMAGE=$(./openshift-install version | awk '/release image/ {print $3}')
```

4. Extract the list of CredentialsRequest custom resources (CRs) from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc adm release extract \
  --from=$RELEASE_IMAGE \
  --credentials-requests \
  --included \1
  --install-config=<path_to_directory_with_installation_configuration>/install-config.yaml \2
  --to=<path_to_directory_for_credentials_requests> 3
```

The --included parameter includes only the manifests that your specific cluster configuration requires.
Specify the location of the install-config.yaml file.
Specify the path to the directory where you want to store the CredentialsRequest objects. If the specified directory does not exist, this command creates it.

This command creates a YAML file for each CredentialsRequest object.
Sample CredentialsRequest object

```yaml
apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
kind: CredentialsRequest
metadata:
  name: <component_credentials_request>
  namespace: openshift-cloud-credential-operator
  ...
spec:
  providerSpec:
    apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
    kind: AzureProviderSpec
    roleBindings:
    - role: Contributor
  ...
```

5. Create YAML files for secrets in the openshift-install manifests directory that you generated previously. The secrets must be stored using the namespace and secret name defined in the spec.secretRef for each CredentialsRequest object.
Sample CredentialsRequest object with secrets

```yaml
apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
kind: CredentialsRequest
metadata:
  name: <component_credentials_request>
  namespace: openshift-cloud-credential-operator
  ...
spec:
  providerSpec:
    apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
    kind: AzureProviderSpec
    roleBindings:
    - role: Contributor
      ...
  secretRef:
    name: <component_secret>
    namespace: <component_namespace>
  ...
```

Sample Secret object

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: <component_secret>
  namespace: <component_namespace>
data:
  azure_subscription_id: <base64_encoded_azure_subscription_id>
  azure_client_id: <base64_encoded_azure_client_id>
  azure_client_secret: <base64_encoded_azure_client_secret>
  azure_tenant_id: <base64_encoded_azure_tenant_id>
  azure_resource_prefix: <base64_encoded_azure_resource_prefix>
  azure_resourcegroup: <base64_encoded_azure_resourcegroup>
  azure_region: <base64_encoded_azure_region>
```



[IMPORTANT]
----
Before upgrading a cluster that uses manually maintained credentials, you must ensure that the CCO is in an upgradeable state.
----

## Configuring an Azure cluster to use short-term credentials

To install a cluster that uses Microsoft Entra Workload ID, you must configure the Cloud Credential Operator utility and create the required Azure resources for your cluster.

### Configuring the Cloud Credential Operator utility

To create and manage cloud credentials from outside of the cluster when the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) is operating in manual mode, extract and prepare the CCO utility (ccoctl) binary.


[NOTE]
----
The ccoctl utility is a Linux binary that must run in a Linux environment.
----

* You have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform account with cluster administrator access.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have created a global Microsoft Azure account for the ccoctl utility to use with the following permissions:
Required Azure permissions
* Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/read
* Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/write
* Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/delete
* Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/read
* Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/delete
* Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write
* Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/read
* Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/write
* Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/delete
* Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/listkeys/action
* Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/delete
* Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/read
* Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/write
* Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/write
* Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/delete
* Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/read
* Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/delete
* Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/read
* Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/write
* Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/federatedIdentityCredentials/read
* Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/federatedIdentityCredentials/write
* Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/federatedIdentityCredentials/delete
* Microsoft.Storage/register/action
* Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/register/action

1. Set a variable for the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:

```terminal
$ RELEASE_IMAGE=$(./openshift-install version | awk '/release image/ {print $3}')
```

2. Obtain the CCO container image from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:

```terminal
$ CCO_IMAGE=$(oc adm release info --image-for='cloud-credential-operator' $RELEASE_IMAGE -a ~/.pull-secret)
```


[NOTE]
----
Ensure that the architecture of the $RELEASE_IMAGE matches the architecture of the environment in which you will use the ccoctl tool.
----
3. Extract the ccoctl binary from the CCO container image within the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc image extract $CCO_IMAGE \
  --file="/usr/bin/ccoctl.<rhel_version>" \1
  -a ~/.pull-secret
```

For <rhel_version>, specify the value that corresponds to the version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) that the host uses.
If no value is specified, ccoctl.rhel8 is used by default.
The following values are valid:
* rhel8: Specify this value for hosts that use RHEL 8.
* rhel9: Specify this value for hosts that use RHEL 9.

[NOTE]
----
The ccoctl binary is created in the directory from where you executed the command and not in /usr/bin/. You must rename the directory or move the ccoctl.<rhel_version> binary to ccoctl.
----
4. Change the permissions to make ccoctl executable by running the following command:

```terminal
$ chmod 775 ccoctl
```


* To verify that ccoctl is ready to use, display the help file. Use a relative file name when you run the command, for example:

```terminal
$ ./ccoctl
```

Example output

```terminal
OpenShift credentials provisioning tool

Usage:
  ccoctl [command]

Available Commands:
  aws          Manage credentials objects for AWS cloud
  azure        Manage credentials objects for Azure
  gcp          Manage credentials objects for Google cloud
  help         Help about any command
  ibmcloud     Manage credentials objects for {ibm-cloud-title}
  nutanix      Manage credentials objects for Nutanix

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for ccoctl

Use "ccoctl [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```


### Creating Azure resources with the Cloud Credential Operator utility

You can use the ccoctl azure create-all command to automate the creation of Azure resources.


[NOTE]
----
By default, ccoctl creates objects in the directory in which the commands are run. To create the objects in a different directory, use the --output-dir flag. This procedure uses <path_to_ccoctl_output_dir> to refer to this directory.
----

You must have:

* Extracted and prepared the ccoctl binary.
* Access to your Microsoft Azure account by using the Azure CLI.

1. Set a $RELEASE_IMAGE variable with the release image from your installation file by running the following command:

```terminal
$ RELEASE_IMAGE=$(./openshift-install version | awk '/release image/ {print $3}')
```

2. Extract the list of CredentialsRequest objects from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc adm release extract \
  --from=$RELEASE_IMAGE \
  --credentials-requests \
  --included \1
  --install-config=<path_to_directory_with_installation_configuration>/install-config.yaml \2
  --to=<path_to_directory_for_credentials_requests> 3
```

The --included parameter includes only the manifests that your specific cluster configuration requires.
Specify the location of the install-config.yaml file.
Specify the path to the directory where you want to store the CredentialsRequest objects. If the specified directory does not exist, this command creates it.

[NOTE]
----
This command might take a few moments to run.
----
3. To enable the ccoctl utility to detect your Azure credentials automatically, log in to the Azure CLI by running the following command:

```terminal
$ az login
```

4. Use the ccoctl tool to process all CredentialsRequest objects by running the following command:

```terminal
$ ccoctl azure create-all \
  --name=<azure_infra_name> \1
  --output-dir=<ccoctl_output_dir> \2
  --region=<azure_region> \3
  --subscription-id=<azure_subscription_id> \4
  --credentials-requests-dir=<path_to_credentials_requests_directory> \5
  --dnszone-resource-group-name=<azure_dns_zone_resource_group_name> \6
  --tenant-id=<azure_tenant_id> \7
  --network-resource-group-name <azure_resource_group> 8
```

Specify the user-defined name for all created Azure resources used for tracking.
Optional: Specify the directory in which you want the ccoctl utility to create objects. By default, the utility creates objects in the directory in which the commands are run.
Specify the Azure region in which cloud resources will be created.
Specify the Azure subscription ID to use.
Specify the directory containing the files for the component CredentialsRequest objects.
Specify the name of the resource group containing the cluster's base domain Azure DNS zone.
Specify the Azure tenant ID to use.
Optional: Specify the virtual network resource group if it is different from the cluster resource group.

[NOTE]
----
If your cluster uses Technology Preview features that are enabled by the TechPreviewNoUpgrade feature set, you must include the --enable-tech-preview parameter.
To see additional optional parameters and explanations of how to use them, run the azure create-all --help command.
----

* To verify that the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform secrets are created, list the files in the <path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/manifests directory:

```terminal
$ ls <path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/manifests
```

Example output

```text
azure-ad-pod-identity-webhook-config.yaml
cluster-authentication-02-config.yaml
openshift-cloud-controller-manager-azure-cloud-credentials-credentials.yaml
openshift-cloud-network-config-controller-cloud-credentials-credentials.yaml
openshift-cluster-api-capz-manager-bootstrap-credentials-credentials.yaml
openshift-cluster-csi-drivers-azure-disk-credentials-credentials.yaml
openshift-cluster-csi-drivers-azure-file-credentials-credentials.yaml
openshift-image-registry-installer-cloud-credentials-credentials.yaml
openshift-ingress-operator-cloud-credentials-credentials.yaml
openshift-machine-api-azure-cloud-credentials-credentials.yaml
```


You can verify that the Microsoft Entra ID service accounts are created by querying Azure. For more information, refer to Azure documentation on listing Entra ID service accounts.

### Incorporating the Cloud Credential Operator utility manifests

To implement short-term security credentials managed outside the cluster for individual components, you must move the manifest files that the Cloud Credential Operator utility (ccoctl) created to the correct directories for the installation program.

* You have configured an account with the cloud platform that hosts your cluster.
* You have configured the Cloud Credential Operator utility (ccoctl).
* You have created the cloud provider resources that are required for your cluster with the ccoctl utility.

1. If you did not set the credentialsMode parameter in the install-config.yaml configuration file to Manual, modify the value as shown:
Sample configuration file snippet

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
credentialsMode: Manual
# ...
```

2. If you used the ccoctl utility to create a new Azure resource group instead of using an existing resource group, modify the resourceGroupName parameter in the install-config.yaml as shown:
Sample configuration file snippet

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
# ...
platform:
  azure:
    resourceGroupName: <azure_infra_name> 1
# ...
```

This value must match the user-defined name for Azure resources that was specified with the --name argument of the ccoctl azure create-all command.
3. If you have not previously created installation manifest files, do so by running the following command:

```terminal
$ openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory>
```


where <installation_directory> is the directory in which the installation program creates files.
4. Copy the manifests that the ccoctl utility generated to the manifests directory that the installation program created by running the following command:

```terminal
$ cp /<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/manifests/* ./manifests/
```

5. Copy the tls directory that contains the private key to the installation directory:

```terminal
$ cp -a /<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/tls .
```


# Deploying the cluster

You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on a compatible cloud platform.


[IMPORTANT]
----
You can run the create cluster command of the installation program only once, during initial installation.
----

* You have configured an account with the cloud platform that hosts your cluster.
* You have the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.
* You have an Azure subscription ID and tenant ID.

* In the directory that contains the installation program, initialize the cluster deployment by running the following command:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install create cluster --dir <installation_directory> \ 1
    --log-level=info 2
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the
location of your customized ./install-config.yaml file.
To view different installation details, specify warn, debug, or
error instead of info.

When the cluster deployment completes successfully:

* The terminal displays directions for accessing your cluster, including a link to the web console and credentials for the kubeadmin user.
* Credential information also outputs to <installation_directory>/.openshift_install.log.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not delete the installation program or the files that the installation program creates. Both are required to delete the cluster.
----


```terminal
...
INFO Install complete!
INFO To access the cluster as the system:admin user when using 'oc', run 'export KUBECONFIG=/home/myuser/install_dir/auth/kubeconfig'
INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.mycluster.example.com
INFO Login to the console with user: "kubeadmin", and password: "password"
INFO Time elapsed: 36m22s
```



[IMPORTANT]
----
* The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending node-bootstrapper certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for Recovering from expired control plane certificates for more information.
* It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.
----

# Logging in to the cluster by using the CLI

To log in to your cluster as the default system user, export the kubeconfig file. This configuration enables the CLI to authenticate and connect to the specific API server created during Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation.

The kubeconfig file is specific to a cluster and is created during Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation.

* You deployed an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

1. Export the kubeadmin credentials by running the following command:

```terminal
$ export KUBECONFIG=<installation_directory>/auth/kubeconfig
```


where:
<installation_directory>:: Specifies the path to the directory that stores the installation files.
2. Verify you can run oc commands successfully using the exported configuration by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc whoami
```

Example output

```terminal
system:admin
```


* Accessing the web console
