# Installing a cluster on vSphere using the Agent-based Installer


The Agent-based installation method provides the flexibility to boot your on-premises servers in any way that you choose. It combines the ease of use of the Assisted Installation service with the ability to run offline, including in air-gapped environments.
Agent-based installation is a subcommand of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installer. It generates a bootable ISO image containing all of the information required to deploy an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster with an available release image.
