# AlertingRule [monitoring.openshift.io/v1]


Description:: 
AlertingRule represents a set of user-defined Prometheus rule groups containing alerting rules.  This resource is the supported method for cluster admins to create alerts based on metrics recorded by the platform monitoring stack in OpenShift, i.e. the Prometheus instance deployed to the openshift-monitoring namespace.  You might use this to create custom alerting rules not shipped with OpenShift based on metrics from components such as the node_exporter, which provides machine-level metrics such as CPU usage, or kube-state-metrics, which provides metrics on Kubernetes usage.
 The API is mostly compatible with the upstream PrometheusRule type from the prometheus-operator.  The primary difference being that recording rules are not allowed here - only alerting rules.  For each AlertingRule resource created, a corresponding PrometheusRule will be created in the openshift-monitoring namespace.  OpenShift requires admins to use the AlertingRule resource rather than the upstream type in order to allow better OpenShift specific defaulting and validation, while not modifying the upstream APIs directly.
 You can find upstream API documentation for PrometheusRule resources here:
 https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/main/Documentation/api.md
 Compatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).

# Specification



## .spec

Description:: 
spec describes the desired state of this AlertingRule object.
Type:: object
Required:: 
* groups



## .spec.groups

Description:: 
groups is a list of grouped alerting rules.  Rule groups are the unit at which Prometheus parallelizes rule processing.  All rules in a single group share a configured evaluation interval.  All rules in the group will be processed together on this interval, sequentially, and all rules will be processed.
 It's common to group related alerting rules into a single AlertingRule resources, and within that resource, closely related alerts, or simply alerts with the same interval, into individual groups.  You are also free to create AlertingRule resources with only a single rule group, but be aware that this can have a performance impact on Prometheus if the group is extremely large or has very complex query expressions to evaluate. Spreading very complex rules across multiple groups to allow them to be processed in parallel is also a common use-case.
Type:: array

## .spec.groups[]

Description:: 
RuleGroup is a list of sequentially evaluated alerting rules.
Type:: object
Required:: 
* name
* rules



## .spec.groups[].rules

Description:: 
rules is a list of sequentially evaluated alerting rules.  Prometheus may process rule groups in parallel, but rules within a single group are always processed sequentially, and all rules are processed.
Type:: array

## .spec.groups[].rules[]

Description:: 
Rule describes an alerting rule. See Prometheus documentation: - https://www.prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules
Type:: object
Required:: 
* alert
* expr



## .status

Description:: 
status describes the current state of this AlertOverrides object.
Type:: object



## .status.prometheusRule

Description:: 
prometheusRule is the generated PrometheusRule for this AlertingRule.  Each AlertingRule instance results in a generated PrometheusRule object in the same namespace, which is always the openshift-monitoring namespace.
