# Preparing for users


After installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, you can further expand and customize your
cluster to your requirements, including taking steps to prepare for users.

# Understanding identity provider configuration

The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform control plane includes a built-in OAuth server. Developers and
administrators obtain OAuth access tokens to authenticate themselves to the API.

As an administrator, you can configure OAuth to specify an identity provider
after you install your cluster.

## About identity providers in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

By default, only a kubeadmin user exists on your cluster. To specify an
identity provider, you must create a custom resource (CR) that describes
that identity provider and add it to the cluster.


[NOTE]
----
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform user names containing /, :, and % are not supported.
----

## Supported identity providers

You can configure the following types of identity providers:



After you define an identity provider, you can
use
RBAC to define and apply permissions.

## Identity provider parameters

The following parameters are common to all identity providers:




[NOTE]
----
When adding or changing identity providers, you can map identities from the new
provider to existing users by setting the mappingMethod parameter to
add.
----

## Sample identity provider CR

The following custom resource (CR) shows the parameters and default
values that you use to configure an identity provider. This example
uses the htpasswd identity provider.


```yaml
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: OAuth
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  identityProviders:
  - name: my_identity_provider 1
    mappingMethod: claim 2
    type: HTPasswd
    htpasswd:
      fileData:
        name: htpass-secret 3
```


This provider name is prefixed to provider user names to form an
identity name.
Controls how mappings are established between this provider's
identities and User objects.
An existing secret containing a file generated using
htpasswd.

# Using RBAC to define and apply permissions

Understand and apply role-based access control.

## RBAC overview

Role-based access control (RBAC) objects determine whether a user is allowed to
perform a given action within a project.

can use the cluster roles and bindings to control who has various access levels to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform platform itself and all projects.

Developers can use local roles and bindings to control who has access
to their projects. Note that authorization is a separate step from
authentication, which is more about determining the identity of who is taking the action.

Authorization is managed using:



Be mindful of the difference between local and cluster bindings. For example,
if you bind the cluster-admin role to a user by using a local role binding,
it might appear that this user has the privileges of a cluster administrator.
This is not the case. Binding the cluster-admin to a user in a project
grants super administrator privileges for only that project to the user. That user has the permissions of the cluster role admin, plus a few additional permissions like the ability to edit rate limits, for that project. This binding can be confusing via the web console UI, which does not list cluster role bindings that are bound to true cluster administrators. However, it does list local role bindings that you can use to locally bind cluster-admin.

The relationships between cluster roles, local roles, cluster role bindings,
local role bindings, users, groups and service accounts are illustrated below.

![Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform RBAC]


[WARNING]
----
The get pods/exec, get pods/*, and get * rules grant execution privileges when they are applied to a role. Apply the principle of least privilege and assign only the minimal RBAC rights required for users and agents. For more information, see RBAC rules allow execution privileges.
----

### Evaluating authorization

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform evaluates authorization by using:

Identity:: The user name and list of groups that the user belongs to.
Action:: The action you perform. In most cases, this consists of:
* Project: The project you access. A project is a Kubernetes namespace with
additional annotations that allows a community of users to organize and manage
their content in isolation from other communities.
* Verb : The action itself:  get, list, create, update, delete, deletecollection, or watch.
* Resource name: The API endpoint that you access.
Bindings:: The full list of bindings, the associations between users or groups
with a role.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform evaluates authorization by using the following steps:

1. The identity and the project-scoped action is used to find all bindings that
apply to the user or their groups.
2. Bindings are used to locate all the roles that apply.
3. Roles are used to find all the rules that apply.
4. The action is checked against each rule to find a match.
5. If no matching rule is found, the action is then denied by default.

including a matrix of the verbs and resources each are associated with.

## Projects and namespaces

A Kubernetes namespace provides a mechanism to scope resources in a cluster.
The
Kubernetes documentation
has more information on namespaces.

Namespaces provide a unique scope for:

* Named resources to avoid basic naming collisions.
* Delegated management authority to trusted users.
* The ability to limit community resource consumption.

Most objects in the system are scoped by namespace, but some are
excepted and have no namespace, including nodes and users.

A project is a Kubernetes namespace with additional annotations and is the central vehicle
by which access to resources for regular users is managed.
A project allows a community of users to organize and manage their content in
isolation from other communities. Users must be given access to projects by administrators,
or if allowed to create projects, automatically have access to their own projects.

Projects can have a separate name, displayName, and description.

* The mandatory name is a unique identifier for the project and is most visible when using the CLI tools or API. The maximum name length is 63 characters.
* The optional displayName is how the project is displayed in the web console (defaults to name).
* The optional description can be a more detailed description of the project and is also visible in the web console.

Each project scopes its own set of:



Cluster administrators
can create projects and delegate administrative rights for the project to any member of the user community.
Cluster administrators
can also allow developers to create their own projects.

Developers and administrators can interact with projects by using the CLI or the
web console.

## Default projects

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform comes with a number of default projects, and projects
starting with openshift- are the most essential to users.
These projects host master components that run as pods and other infrastructure
components. The pods created in these namespaces that have a
critical pod annotation
are considered critical, and the have guaranteed admission by kubelet.
Pods created for master components in these namespaces are already marked as
critical.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not run workloads in or share access to default projects. Default projects are reserved for running core cluster components.
The following default projects are considered highly privileged: default, kube-public, kube-system, openshift, openshift-infra, openshift-node, and other system-created projects that have the openshift.io/run-level label set to 0 or 1. Functionality that relies on admission plugins, such as pod security admission, security context constraints, cluster resource quotas, and image reference resolution, does not work in highly privileged projects.
----

## Viewing cluster roles and bindings

You can use the oc CLI to view cluster roles and bindings by using the
oc describe command.

* Install the oc CLI.
* Obtain permission to view the cluster roles and bindings.

1. To view the cluster roles and their associated rule sets:
2. To view the current set of cluster role bindings, which shows the users and
groups that are bound to various roles:

## Viewing local roles and bindings

You can use the oc CLI to view local roles and bindings by using the
oc describe command.

* Install the oc CLI.
* Obtain permission to view the local roles and bindings:
* Users with the admin default cluster role bound locally can view and manage
roles and bindings in that project.

1. To view the current set of local role bindings, which show the users and groups
that are bound to various roles for the current project:

```terminal
$ oc describe rolebinding.rbac
```

2. To view the local role bindings for a different project, add the -n flag
to the command:

```terminal
$ oc describe rolebinding.rbac -n joe-project
```

## Adding roles to users

You can use  the oc adm administrator CLI to manage the roles and bindings.

Binding, or adding, a role to users or groups gives the user or group the access
that is granted by the role. You can add and remove roles to and from users and
groups using oc adm policy commands.

You can bind any of the default cluster roles to local users or groups in your
project.

1. Add a role to a user in a specific project:

```terminal
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user <role> <user> -n <project>
```


For example, you can add the admin role to the alice user in joe project
by running:

```terminal
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user admin alice -n joe
```


[TIP]
----
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to add the role to the user:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: admin-0
  namespace: joe
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: admin
subjects:
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: User
  name: alice
```

----
2. View the local role bindings and verify the addition in the output:

```terminal
$ oc describe rolebinding.rbac -n <project>
```


For example, to view the local role bindings for the joe project:

```terminal
$ oc describe rolebinding.rbac -n joe
```

Example output

```terminal

## Local role binding commands

When you manage a user or group&#8217;s associated roles for local role bindings using the
following operations, a project may be specified with the -n flag. If it is
not specified, then the current project is used.

You can use the following commands for local RBAC management.



## Cluster role bindings for unauthenticated groups


[NOTE]
----
Before Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.17, unauthenticated groups were allowed access to some cluster roles. Clusters updated from versions before Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.17 retain this access for unauthenticated groups.
----

For security reasons Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.17 does not allow unauthenticated groups to have default access to cluster roles.

There are use cases where it might be necessary to add system:unauthenticated to a cluster role.

Cluster administrators can add unauthenticated users to the following cluster roles:

* system:scope-impersonation
* system:webhook
* system:oauth-token-deleter
* self-access-reviewer


[IMPORTANT]
----
Always verify compliance with your organization's security standards when modifying unauthenticated access.
----

## Adding unauthenticated groups to cluster roles

As a cluster administrator, you can add unauthenticated users to the following cluster roles in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform by creating a cluster role binding. Unauthenticated users do not have access to non-public cluster roles. This should only be done in specific use cases when necessary.

You can add unauthenticated users to the following cluster roles:

* system:scope-impersonation
* system:webhook
* system:oauth-token-deleter
* self-access-reviewer


[IMPORTANT]
----
Always verify compliance with your organization's security standards when modifying unauthenticated access.
----

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Create a YAML file named add-<cluster_role>-unauth.yaml and add the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
 annotations:
   rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate: "true"
 name: <cluster_role>access-unauthenticated
roleRef:
 apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
 kind: ClusterRole
 name: <cluster_role>
subjects:
 - apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
   kind: Group
   name: system:unauthenticated
```

2. Apply the configuration by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f add-<cluster_role>.yaml
```


# The kubeadmin user

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform creates a cluster administrator, kubeadmin, after the
installation process completes.

This user has the cluster-admin role automatically applied and is treated
as the root user for the cluster. The password is dynamically generated
and unique to your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform environment. After installation
completes the password is provided in the installation program&#8217;s output.
For example:


```terminal
INFO Install complete!
INFO Run 'export KUBECONFIG=<your working directory>/auth/kubeconfig' to manage the cluster with 'oc', the OpenShift CLI.
INFO The cluster is ready when 'oc login -u kubeadmin -p <provided>' succeeds (wait a few minutes).
INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.demo1.openshift4-beta-abcorp.com
INFO Login to the console with user: kubeadmin, password: <provided>
```


## Removing the kubeadmin user

After you define an identity provider and create a new cluster-admin
user, you can remove the kubeadmin to improve cluster security.


[WARNING]
----
If you follow this procedure before another user is a cluster-admin,
then Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform must be reinstalled. It is not possible to undo
this command.
----

* You must have configured at least one identity provider.
* You must have added the cluster-admin role to a user.
* You must be logged in as an administrator.

* Remove the kubeadmin secrets:

```terminal
$ oc delete secrets kubeadmin -n kube-system
```


# Populating OperatorHub from mirrored Operator catalogs

If you mirrored Operator catalogs for use with disconnected clusters, you can populate OperatorHub with the Operators from your mirrored catalogs. You can use the generated manifests from the mirroring process to create the required ImageContentSourcePolicy and CatalogSource objects.

## Prerequisites

* Mirroring Operator catalogs for use with disconnected clusters

### Creating the ImageContentSourcePolicy object

After mirroring Operator catalog content to your mirror registry, create the required ImageContentSourcePolicy (ICSP) object. The ICSP object configures nodes to translate between the image references stored in Operator manifests and the mirrored registry.

* On a host with access to the disconnected cluster, create the ICSP by running the following command to specify the imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml file in your manifests directory:

```terminal
$ oc create -f <path/to/manifests/dir>/imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml
```


where <path/to/manifests/dir> is the path to the manifests directory for your mirrored content.

You can now create a CatalogSource object to reference your mirrored index image and Operator content.

### Adding a catalog source to a cluster

Adding a catalog source to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster enables the discovery and installation of Operators for users.
Cluster administrators
can create a CatalogSource object that references an index image. OperatorHub uses catalog sources to populate the user interface.


[TIP]
----
Alternatively, you can use the web console to manage catalog sources. From the Administration -> Cluster Settings -> Configuration -> OperatorHub page, click the Sources tab, where you can create, update, delete, disable, and enable individual sources.
----

* You built and pushed an index image to a registry.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

1. Create a CatalogSource object that references your index image.
If you used the oc adm catalog mirror command to mirror your catalog to a target registry, you can use the generated catalogSource.yaml file in your manifests directory as a starting point.
1. Modify the following to your specifications and save it as a catalogSource.yaml file:

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: CatalogSource
metadata:
  name: my-operator-catalog 1
  namespace: {namespace} 2
spec:
  sourceType: grpc
  grpcPodConfig:
    securityContextConfig: <security_mode> 3
  image: <registry>/<namespace>/{index-image}:{tag} 4
  displayName: My Operator Catalog
  publisher: <publisher_name> 5
  updateStrategy:
    registryPoll: 6
      interval: 30m
```

If you mirrored content to local files before uploading to a registry, remove any backslash (/) characters from the metadata.name field to avoid an "invalid resource name" error when you create the object.
If you want the catalog source to be available globally to users in all namespaces, specify the {namespace} namespace. Otherwise, you can specify a different namespace for the catalog to be scoped and available only for that namespace.
Specify the value of legacy or restricted. If the field is not set, the default value is legacy. In a future Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release, it is planned that the default value will be restricted. If your catalog cannot run with restricted permissions, it is recommended that you manually set this field to legacy.
Specify your index image. If you specify a tag after the image name, for example :{tag}, the catalog source pod uses an image pull policy of Always, meaning the pod always pulls the image prior to starting the container. If you specify a digest, for example @sha256:<id>, the image pull policy is IfNotPresent, meaning the pod pulls the image only if it does not already exist on the node.
Specify your name or an organization name publishing the catalog.
Catalog sources can automatically check for new versions to keep up to date.
2. Use the file to create the CatalogSource object:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f catalogSource.yaml
```

2. Verify the following resources are created successfully.
1. Check the pods:

```terminal
$ oc get pods -n {namespace}
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS  AGE
my-operator-catalog-6njx6               1/1     Running   0         28s
marketplace-operator-d9f549946-96sgr    1/1     Running   0         26h
```

2. Check the catalog source:

```terminal
$ oc get catalogsource -n {namespace}
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                  DISPLAY               TYPE PUBLISHER  AGE
my-operator-catalog   My Operator Catalog   grpc            5s
```

3. Check the package manifest:

```terminal
$ oc get packagemanifest -n {namespace}
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                          CATALOG               AGE
jaeger-product                My Operator Catalog   93s
```


You can now install the Operators from the OperatorHub page on your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

* Accessing images for Operators from private registries
* Image template for custom catalog sources
* Image pull policy

# About Operator installation with OperatorHub

OperatorHub is a user interface for discovering Operators; it works in conjunction with Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), which installs and manages Operators on a cluster.

As a cluster administrator, you can install an Operator from OperatorHub by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

During installation, you must determine the following initial settings for the Operator:

Update Channel:: If an Operator is available through multiple channels, you can choose which channel you want to subscribe to. For example, to deploy from the stable channel, if available, select it from the list.
Approval Strategy:: You can choose automatic or manual updates.

If you choose automatic updates for an installed Operator, when a new version of that Operator is available in the selected channel, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically upgrades the running instance of your Operator without human intervention.

If you select manual updates, when a newer version of an Operator is available, OLM creates an update request. As a
cluster administrator,
you must then manually approve that update request to have the Operator updated to the new version.

## Installing from OperatorHub by using the web console

You can install and subscribe to an Operator from OperatorHub by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

* Access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster using an account with

1. Navigate in the web console to the Operators → OperatorHub page.
2. Scroll or type a keyword into the Filter by keyword box to find the Operator you want. For example, type {filter-type} to find the {filter-operator} Operator.

You can also filter options by Infrastructure Features. For example, select Disconnected if you want to see Operators that work in disconnected environments, also known as restricted network environments.
3. Select the Operator to display additional information.

[NOTE]
----
Choosing a Community Operator warns that Red Hat does not certify Community Operators; you must acknowledge the warning before continuing.
----
4. Read the information about the Operator and click Install.
5. On the Install Operator page, configure your Operator installation:
1. If you want to install a specific version of an Operator, select an Update channel and Version from the lists. You can browse the various versions of an Operator across any channels it might have, view the metadata for that channel and version, and select the exact version you want to install.

[NOTE]
----
The version selection defaults to the latest version for the channel selected. If the latest version for the channel is selected, the Automatic approval strategy is enabled by default. Otherwise, Manual approval is required when not installing the latest version for the selected channel.
Installing an Operator with Manual approval causes all Operators installed within the namespace to function with the Manual approval strategy and all Operators are updated together. If you want to update Operators independently, install Operators into separate namespaces.
----
2. Confirm the installation mode for the Operator:
* All namespaces on the cluster (default) installs the Operator in the default openshift-operators namespace to watch and be made available to all namespaces in the cluster. This option is not always available.
* A specific namespace on the cluster allows you to choose a specific, single namespace in which to install the Operator. The Operator will only watch and be made available for use in this single namespace.
3. For clusters on cloud providers with token authentication enabled:
* If the cluster uses AWS STS (STS Mode in the web console), enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS IAM role of your service account in the role ARN field. To create the role's ARN, follow the procedure described in Preparing AWS account.
* If the cluster uses Microsoft Entra Workload ID (Workload Identity / Federated Identity Mode in the web console), add the client ID, tenant ID, and subscription ID in the appropriate field.
4. For Update approval, select either the Automatic or Manual approval strategy.

[IMPORTANT]
----
If the web console shows that the cluster uses AWS STS or Microsoft Entra Workload ID, you must set Update approval to Manual.
Subscriptions with automatic update approvals are not recommended because there might be permission changes to make prior to updating. Subscriptions with manual update approvals ensure that administrators have the opportunity to verify the permissions of the later version and take any necessary steps prior to update.
----
6. Click Install to make the Operator available to the selected namespaces on this Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster:
1. If you selected a Manual approval strategy, the upgrade status of the subscription remains Upgrading until you review and approve the install plan.

After approving on the Install Plan page, the subscription upgrade status moves to Up to date.
2. If you selected an Automatic approval strategy, the upgrade status should resolve to Up to date without intervention.

* After the upgrade status of the subscription is Up to date, select Operators -> Installed Operators to verify that the cluster service version (CSV) of the installed Operator eventually shows up. The Status should eventually resolve to Succeeded in the relevant namespace.

[NOTE]
----
For the All namespaces&#8230;&#8203; installation mode, the status resolves to Succeeded in the openshift-operators namespace, but the status is Copied if you check in other namespaces.
----

If it does not:
* Check the logs in any pods in the openshift-operators project (or other relevant namespace if A specific namespace&#8230;&#8203; installation mode was selected) on the Workloads -> Pods page that are reporting issues to troubleshoot further.
* When the Operator is installed, the metadata indicates which channel and version are installed.

[NOTE]
----
The Channel and Version dropdown menus are still available for viewing other version metadata in this catalog context.
----
