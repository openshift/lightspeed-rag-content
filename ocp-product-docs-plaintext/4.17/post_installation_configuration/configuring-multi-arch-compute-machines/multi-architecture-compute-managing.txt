# Managing a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines


Managing a cluster that has nodes with multiple architectures requires you to consider node architecture as you monitor the cluster and manage your workloads. This requires you to take additional considerations into account when you
configure cluster resource requirements and behavior, or
schedule workloads in a multi-architecture cluster.

# Scheduling workloads on clusters with multi-architecture compute machines

When you deploy workloads on a cluster with compute nodes that use different architectures, you must align pod architecture with the architecture of the underlying node. Your workload may also require additional configuration to particular resources depending on the underlying node architecture.

You can use the Multiarch Tuning Operator to enable architecture-aware scheduling of workloads on clusters with multi-architecture compute machines. The Multiarch Tuning Operator implements additional scheduler predicates in the pods specifications based on the architectures that the pods can support at creation time.

For information about the Multiarch Tuning Operator, see Managing workloads on multi-architecture clusters by using the Multiarch Tuning Operator.

## Sample multi-architecture node workload deployments

Scheduling a workload to an appropriate node based on architecture works in the same way as scheduling based on any other node characteristic.
Consider the following options when determining how to schedule your workloads.

Using nodeAffinity to schedule nodes with specific architectures:: You can allow a workload to be scheduled on only a set of nodes with architectures supported by its images, you can set the spec.affinity.nodeAffinity field in your pod's template specification.
Example deployment with node affinity set

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata: # ...
spec:
   # ...
  template:
     # ...
    spec:
      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
            nodeSelectorTerms:
            - matchExpressions:
              - key: kubernetes.io/arch
                operator: In
                values: 1
                - amd64
                - arm64
```

Specify the supported architectures. Valid values include amd64,arm64, or both values.

Tainting each node for a specific architecture:: You can taint a node to avoid the node scheduling workloads that are incompatible with its architecture. When your cluster uses a MachineSet object, you can add parameters to the .spec.template.spec.taints field to avoid workloads being scheduled on nodes with non-supported architectures.

Before you add a taint to a node, you must scale down the MachineSet object or remove existing available machines. For more information, see Modifying a compute machine set.
Example machine set with taint set

```yaml
apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: MachineSet
metadata: # ...
spec:
  # ...
  template:
    # ...
    spec:
      # ...
      taints:
      - effect: NoSchedule
        key: multiarch.openshift.io/arch
        value: arm64
```

You can also set a taint on a specific node by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc adm taint nodes <node-name> multiarch.openshift.io/arch=arm64:NoSchedule
```


Creating a default toleration in a namespace:: When a node or machine set has a taint, only workloads that tolerate that taint can be scheduled. You can annotate a namespace so all of the workloads get the same default toleration by running the following command:
Example default toleration set on a namespace

```terminal
$ oc annotate namespace my-namespace \
  'scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/defaultTolerations'='[{"operator": "Exists", "effect": "NoSchedule", "key": "multiarch.openshift.io/arch"}]'
```

Tolerating architecture taints in workloads:: When a node or machine set has a taint, only workloads that tolerate that taint can be scheduled. You can configure your workload with a toleration so that it is scheduled on nodes with specific architecture taints.
Example deployment with toleration set

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata: # ...
spec:
  # ...
  template:
    # ...
    spec:
      tolerations:
      - key: "multiarch.openshift.io/arch"
        value: "arm64"
        operator: "Equal"
        effect: "NoSchedule"
```

This example deployment can be scheduled on nodes and machine sets that have the multiarch.openshift.io/arch=arm64 taint specified.

Using node affinity with taints and tolerations:: When a scheduler computes the set of nodes to schedule a pod, tolerations can broaden the set while node affinity restricts the set. If you set a taint on nodes that have a specific architecture, you must also add a toleration to workloads that you want to be scheduled there.
Example deployment with node affinity and toleration set

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata: # ...
spec:
  # ...
  template:
    # ...
    spec:
      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
            nodeSelectorTerms:
            - matchExpressions:
              - key: kubernetes.io/arch
                operator: In
                values:
                - amd64
                - arm64
      tolerations:
      - key: "multiarch.openshift.io/arch"
        value: "arm64"
        operator: "Equal"
        effect: "NoSchedule"
```

# Enabling 64k pages on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) kernel

You can enable the 64k memory page in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) kernel on the 64-bit ARM compute machines in your cluster. The 64k page size kernel specification can be used for large GPU or high memory workloads. This is done using the Machine Config Operator (MCO) which uses a machine config pool to update the kernel. To enable 64k page sizes, you must dedicate a machine config pool for ARM64 to enable on the kernel.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Using 64k pages is exclusive to 64-bit ARM architecture compute nodes or clusters installed on 64-bit ARM machines. If you configure the 64k pages kernel on a machine config pool using 64-bit x86 machines, the machine config pool and MCO will degrade.
----

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You created a cluster with compute nodes of different architecture on one of the supported platforms.

1. Label the nodes where you want to run the 64k page size kernel:

```terminal
$ oc label node <node_name> <label>
```

Example command

```terminal
$ oc label node worker-arm64-01 node-role.kubernetes.io/worker-64k-pages=
```

2. Create a machine config pool that contains the worker role that uses the ARM64 architecture and the worker-64k-pages role:

```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfigPool
metadata:
  name: worker-64k-pages
spec:
  machineConfigSelector:
    matchExpressions:
      - key: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role
        operator: In
        values:
        - worker
        - worker-64k-pages
  nodeSelector:
    matchLabels:
      node-role.kubernetes.io/worker-64k-pages: ""
      kubernetes.io/arch: arm64
```

3. Create a machine config on your compute node to enable 64k-pages with the 64k-pages parameter.

```terminal
$ oc create -f <filename>.yaml
```

Example MachineConfig

```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: "worker-64k-pages" 1
  name: 99-worker-64kpages
spec:
  kernelType: 64k-pages 2
```

Specify the value of the machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role label in the custom machine config pool. The example MachineConfig uses the worker-64k-pages label to enable 64k pages in the worker-64k-pages pool.
Specify your desired kernel type. Valid values are 64k-pages and default

[NOTE]
----
The 64k-pages type is supported on only 64-bit ARM architecture based compute nodes. The realtime type is supported on only 64-bit x86 architecture based compute nodes.
----

* To view your new worker-64k-pages machine config pool, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get mcp
```

# Importing manifest lists in image streams on your multi-architecture compute machines

On an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.17 cluster with multi-architecture compute machines, the image streams in the cluster do not import manifest lists automatically. You must manually change the default importMode option to the PreserveOriginal option in order to import the manifest list.

* You installed the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI (oc).

* The following example command shows how to patch the ImageStream cli-artifacts so that the cli-artifacts:latest image stream tag is imported as a manifest list.

```terminal
$ oc patch is/cli-artifacts -n openshift -p '{"spec":{"tags":[{"name":"latest","importPolicy":{"importMode":"PreserveOriginal"}}]}}'
```


* You can check that the manifest lists imported properly by inspecting the image stream tag. The following command will list the individual architecture manifests for a particular tag.

```terminal
$ oc get istag cli-artifacts:latest -n openshift -oyaml
```


If the dockerImageManifests object is present, then the manifest list import was successful.
