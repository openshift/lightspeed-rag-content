# Configuring CDI to override CPU and memory quotas


You can configure the Containerized Data Importer (CDI) to import, upload, and clone virtual machine disks into namespaces that are subject to CPU and memory resource restrictions.

# About CPU and memory quotas in a namespace

A resource quota, defined by the ResourceQuota object, imposes restrictions on a namespace that limit the total amount of compute resources that can be consumed by resources within that namespace.

The HyperConverged custom resource (CR) defines the user configuration for the Containerized Data Importer (CDI). The CPU and memory request and limit values are set to a default value of 0. This ensures that pods created by CDI that do not specify compute resource requirements are given the default values and are allowed to run in a namespace that is restricted with a quota.

# Overriding CPU and memory defaults

Modify the default settings for CPU and memory requests and limits for your use case by adding the spec.resourceRequirements.storageWorkloads stanza to the HyperConverged custom resource (CR).

* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Edit the HyperConverged CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc edit hyperconverged kubevirt-hyperconverged -n openshift-cnv
```

2. Add the spec.resourceRequirements.storageWorkloads stanza to the CR, setting the values based on your use case. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: hco.kubevirt.io/v1beta1
kind: HyperConverged
metadata:
  name: kubevirt-hyperconverged
spec:
  resourceRequirements:
    storageWorkloads:
      limits:
        cpu: "500m"
        memory: "2Gi"
      requests:
        cpu: "250m"
        memory: "1Gi"
```

3. Save and exit the editor to update the HyperConverged CR.
