# Editing virtual machines


You can update a virtual machine (VM) configuration by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console. You can update the YAML file or the VirtualMachine details page.
You can also edit a VM by using the command line.
To edit a VM to configure disk sharing by using virtual disks or LUN, see Configuring shared volumes for virtual machines.

# Hot plugging memory on a virtual machine

You can add or remove the amount of memory allocated to a virtual machine (VM) without having to restart the VM by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

1. Navigate to Virtualization -> VirtualMachines.
2. Select the required VM to open the VirtualMachine details page.
3. On the Configuration tab, click Edit CPU|Memory.
4. Enter the desired amount of memory and click Save.

[NOTE]
----
You can hot plug up to three times the default initial amount of memory of the VM. Exceeding this limit requires a restart.
----

The system applies these changes immediately. If the VM is migratable, a live migration is triggered. If not, or if the changes cannot be live-updated, a RestartRequired condition is added to the VM.


[NOTE]
----
Memory hot plugging for virtual machines requires guest operating system support for the virtio-mem driver. This support depends on the driver being included and enabled within the guest operating system, not on specific upstream kernel versions.
Supported guest operating systems:
* RHEL 9.4 and later
* RHEL 8.10 and later (hot-unplug is disabled by default)
* Other Linux guests require kernel version 5.16 or later and the virtio-mem kernel module
* Windows guests require virtio-mem driver version 100.95.104.26200 or later

# Hot plugging CPUs on a virtual machine

You can increase or decrease the number of CPU sockets allocated to a virtual machine (VM) without having to restart the VM by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

1. Navigate to Virtualization -> VirtualMachines.
2. Select the required VM to open the VirtualMachine details page.
3. On the Configuration tab, click Edit CPU|Memory.
4. Select the vCPU radio button.
5. Enter the desired number of vCPU sockets and click Save.

[NOTE]
----
You can hot plug up to three times the default initial number of vCPU sockets of the VM. Exceeding this limit requires a restart.
----

If the VM is migratable, a live migration is triggered. If not, or if the changes cannot be live-updated, a RestartRequired condition is added to the VM.

# Editing a virtual machine by using the command line

You can edit a virtual machine (VM) by using the command line.

* You installed the oc CLI.

1. Obtain the virtual machine configuration by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc edit vm <vm_name>
```

2. Edit the YAML configuration.
3. If you edit a running virtual machine, you need to do one of the following:
* Restart the virtual machine.
* Run the following command for the new configuration to take effect:

```terminal
$ oc apply vm <vm_name> -n <namespace>
```


# Adding a disk to a virtual machine

You can add a virtual disk to a virtual machine (VM) by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

1. Navigate to Virtualization -> VirtualMachines in the web console.
2. Select a VM to open the VirtualMachine details page.
3. On the Disks tab, click Add disk.
4. Specify the Source, Name, Size, Type, Interface, and Storage Class.
1. Optional: You can enable preallocation if you use a blank disk source and require maximum write performance when creating data volumes. To do so, select the Enable preallocation checkbox.
2. Optional: You can clear Apply optimized StorageProfile settings to change the Volume Mode and Access Mode for the virtual disk. If you do not specify these parameters, the system uses the default values from the kubevirt-storage-class-defaults config map.
5. Click Add.


[NOTE]
----
If the VM is running, you must restart the VM to apply the change.

## Storage fields



## Advanced storage settings

The following advanced storage settings are optional and available for Blank, Import via URL, and Clone existing PVC disks.

If you do not specify these parameters, the system uses the default storage profile values.



# Mounting a Windows driver disk on a virtual machine

You can mount a Windows driver disk on a virtual machine (VM) by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

1. Navigate to Virtualization -> VirtualMachines.
2. Select the required VM to open the VirtualMachine details page.
3. On the Configuration tab, click Storage.
4. Select the Mount Windows drivers disk checkbox.

The Windows driver disk is displayed in the list of mounted disks.

# Adding a secret, config map, or service account to a virtual machine

You add a secret, config map, or service account to a virtual machine by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

These resources are added to the virtual machine as disks. You then mount the secret, config map, or service account as you would mount any other disk.

If the virtual machine is running, changes do not take effect until you restart the virtual machine. The newly added resources are marked as pending changes at the top of the page.

* The secret, config map, or service account that you want to add must exist in the same namespace as the target virtual machine.

1. Click Virtualization -> VirtualMachines from the side menu.
2. Select a virtual machine to open the VirtualMachine details page.
3. Click Configuration -> Environment.
4. Click Add Config Map, Secret or Service Account.
5. Click Select a resource and select a resource from the list. A six character serial number is automatically generated for the selected resource.
6. Optional: Click Reload to revert the environment to its last saved state.
7. Click Save.

1. On the VirtualMachine details page, click Configuration -> Disks and verify that the resource is displayed in the list of disks.
2. Restart the virtual machine by clicking Actions -> Restart.

You can now mount the secret, config map, or service account as you would mount any other disk.

## Additional resources for config maps, secrets, and service accounts

* Understanding config maps
* Providing sensitive data to pods
* Understanding and creating service accounts
