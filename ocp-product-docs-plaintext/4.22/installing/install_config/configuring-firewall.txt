# Configuring your firewall


If you use a firewall, you must configure it so that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform can access the sites that it requires to function. You must always grant access to some sites, and you grant access to more if you use Red Hat Lightspeed, the Telemetry service, a cloud to host your cluster, and certain build strategies.

# Configuring your firewall for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

Before you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, you must configure your firewall to grant access to the sites that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform requires. When using a firewall, make additional configurations to the firewall so that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform can access the sites that it requires to function.

There are no special configuration considerations for services running on only controller nodes compared to worker nodes.


[NOTE]
----
If your environment has a dedicated load balancer in front of your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, review the allowlists between your firewall and load balancer to prevent unwanted network restrictions to your cluster.
----

1. Set the following registry URLs for your firewall's allowlist:

* You can use the wildcard *.quay.io instead of cdn.quay.io and cdn0[1-6].quay.io in your allowlist.
* You can use the wildcard *.access.redhat.com to simplify the configuration and ensure that all subdomains, including registry.access.redhat.com, are allowed.
* When you add a site, such as quay.io, to your allowlist, do not add a wildcard entry, such as *.quay.io, to your denylist. In most cases, image registries use a content delivery network (CDN) to serve images. If a firewall blocks access, image downloads are denied when the initial download request redirects to a hostname such as cdn01.quay.io.
2. Set your firewall's allowlist to include any site that provides resources for a language or framework that your builds require.
3. If you do not disable Telemetry, you must grant access to the following URLs to access Red Hat Lightspeed:

4. If you use Alibaba Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud to host your cluster, you must grant access to the URLs that offer the cloud provider API and DNS for that cloud:

5. Allowlist the following URLs:


Operators require route access to perform health checks. Specifically, the authentication and web console Operators connect to two routes to verify that the routes work. If you are the cluster administrator and do not want to allow *.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>, then allow these routes:
* oauth-openshift.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
* canary-openshift-ingress-canary.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
* console-openshift-console.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>, or the hostname
that is specified in the spec.route.hostname field of the
consoles.operator/cluster object if the field is not empty.
6. Allowlist the following URL for optional third-party content:

7. If you use a default Red Hat Network Time Protocol (NTP) server allow the following URLs:
* 1.rhel.pool.ntp.org
* 2.rhel.pool.ntp.org
* 3.rhel.pool.ntp.org


[NOTE]
----
If you do not use a default Red Hat NTP server, verify the NTP server for your platform and allow it in your firewall.

# Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform network flow matrix

The following network flow matrixes describe the ingress flows to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform services for the following environments:

* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on bare metal
* Single-node OpenShift with other platforms
* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Single-node OpenShift on AWS


[NOTE]
----
You can use the commatrix plugin for the oc command to generate local network flow data for your cluster. For more information see "Generating ingress network flow data using the commatrix plugin".
----

Use the information in the appropriate network flow matrix to help you manage ingress traffic for your specific environment. You can restrict ingress traffic to essential flows to improve network security.

Additionally, consider the following dynamic port ranges when managing ingress traffic for both bare metal and cloud environments:

* 9000-9999: Reserved for internal Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform components. Do not assign user workloads or services to ports in this range.
* 30000-32767: Kubernetes NodePort service ports. These ports are required only if you expose services by using the NodePort service type. If NodePort services are not used, you can block this port range.

To view or download the complete raw CSV content for an environment, see the following resources:

* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on bare metal
* Single-node OpenShift with other platforms
* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on AWS
* Single-node OpenShift on AWS


[NOTE]
----
The network flow matrixes describe ingress traffic flows for a base Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform or single-node OpenShift installation. The matrixes do not apply for hosted control planes, Red Hat build of MicroShift, or standalone clusters.
----

## Base network flows

The following matrixes describe the base ingress flows to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform services.


[NOTE]
----
For base ingress flows to single-node OpenShift clusters, see the Control plane node base flows matrix only.
----





## Additional network flows for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on bare metal

In addition to the base network flows, the following matrix describes the ingress flows to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform services that are specific to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on bare metal.



## Additional network flows for single-node OpenShift with other platforms

In addition to the base network flows, the following matrix describes the ingress flows to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform services that are specific to single-node OpenShift configured with platform: none in the installation manifest.



## Additional network flows for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on AWS

In addition to the base network flows, the following matrix describes the ingress flows to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform services that are specific to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on AWS.



## Additional network flows for single-node OpenShift on AWS

In addition to the base network flows, the following matrix describes the ingress flows to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform services that are specific to single-node OpenShift on AWS.



# Ingress network flow analysis with the commatrix plugin

The commatrix plugin for the oc command generates ingress network flow data from your cluster. You can also use the plugin to identify any differences between open ports on the host and expected ingress flows for your environment.

The plugin generates ingress flows to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform services for the following environments:

* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on bare metal
* Single-node OpenShift with other platforms
* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Single-node OpenShift on AWS

The plugin outputs the network flow data in various formats, such as CSV or JSON.

# Installing the commatrix plugin

You can install the commatrix plugin from the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog.


[NOTE]
----
You can also install the commatrix plugin by using Krew. For more information, see "CLI Manager Operator overview".
----

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
