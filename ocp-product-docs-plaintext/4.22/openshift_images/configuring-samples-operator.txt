# Configuring the Cluster Samples Operator


The Cluster Samples Operator, which operates in the openshift namespace, installs and updates the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)-based Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform image streams and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform templates.

[IMPORTANT]
----
* The Cluster Samples Operator is deprecated. No new templates, samples, or non-Source-to-Image (Non-S2I) image streams are added to the Cluster Samples Operator. However, the existing S2I builder image streams and templates will continue to receive updates until the Cluster Samples Operator is removed in a future release. S2I image streams and templates include:
* Ruby
* Python
* Node.js
* Perl
* PHP
* HTTPD
* Nginx
* EAP
* Java
* Webserver
* .NET
* Go
* The Cluster Samples Operator will stop managing and providing support to the non-S2I samples (image streams and templates). You can contact the image stream or template owner for any requirements and future plans. In addition, refer to the following link:
* List of the repositories hosting the image stream or templates
----

# Understanding the Cluster Samples Operator

During installation, the Operator creates the default configuration object for itself and then creates the sample image streams and templates, including quick start templates.


[NOTE]
----
To facilitate image stream imports from other registries that require credentials, a cluster administrator can create any additional secrets that contain the content of a Docker config.json file in the openshift namespace needed for image import.
----

The Cluster Samples Operator configuration is a cluster-wide resource. The deployment of the Operator is within the openshift-cluster-samples-operator namespace.

The image for the Cluster Samples Operator has image stream and template definitions for the associated Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release. When each sample is created or updated, the Cluster Samples Operator includes an annotation that denotes the version of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. The Operator uses this annotation to ensure that each sample matches the release version. Samples outside of its inventory are ignored, as are skipped samples. Modifications to any samples that are managed by the Operator, where that version annotation is modified or deleted, are reverted automatically.


[NOTE]
----
The Jenkins images are part of the image payload from installation and are tagged into the image streams directly.
----

The Cluster Samples Operator configuration resource includes a finalizer which cleans up the following upon deletion:

* Operator managed image streams.
* Operator managed templates.
* Operator generated configuration resources.
* Cluster status resources.

Upon deletion of the samples resource, the Cluster Samples Operator recreates the resource by using the default configuration.

If the Cluster Samples Operator is removed during installation, you can use the Cluster Samples Operator with an alternate registry so that content can be imported. Then you can set the Cluster Samples Operator to Managed to get the samples. Use the following instructions:

* Using the Cluster Samples Operator with an alternate registry

# Cluster Samples Operator use of management state

The Cluster Samples Operator is bootstrapped as Managed by default or if global proxy is configured.

In the Managed state, the Cluster Samples Operator is actively managing its resources and keeping the component active to pull sample image streams and images from the registry and ensure that the requisite sample templates are installed.

Certain circumstances result in the Cluster Samples Operator bootstrapping itself as Removed including:

* If the Cluster Samples Operator cannot reach the registry after three minutes on initial startup after a clean installation.
* If the Cluster Samples Operator detects that it is on an IPv6 network.
* If the image controller configuration parameters prevent the creation of image streams by using the default image registry, or by using the image registry specified by samplesRegistry setting. For more information, see the following links:
* Image controller configuration parameters
* Cluster Samples Operator configuration parameters


[NOTE]
----
For Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, the default image registry is
----


[IMPORTANT]
----
IPv6 installations are not currently supported by the registry. The Cluster Samples Operator pulls most of the sample image streams and images from the registry.

## Restricted network installation

The Cluster Samples Operator boostrapping itself as Removed when unable to access registry.redhat.io facilitates restricted network installations when the network restriction is already in place.

As a cluster administrator, you have more time to decide if samples are needed when the Operator is boostrapped Removed. This is because the Cluster Samples Operator does not submit alerts that sample image stream imports are failing when the management state is Removed. When the Cluster Samples Operator management state is Managed, and the Operator attempts to install sample image streams, failing-import alerts start two hours after initial installation.

## Restricted network installation with initial network access

If a cluster that eventually runs on a restricted network is first installed while network access exists, the Cluster Samples Operator installs content from registry.redhat.io.

In this case, you can defer samples installation until you have decided which samples are needed by overriding the default configuration of Managed for a connected installation.

If you want the Cluster Samples Operator to bootstrap with the management state as Removed during an installation that has initial network access, override the Cluster Samples Operator default configuration by using the following instructions:

* Customizing nodes

To host samples in your restricted environment, use the following instructions:

* Using the Cluster Samples Operator with an alternate registry

You must also put the following additional YAML file in the openshift directory created by the openshift-install create manifest process:


```yaml
apiVersion: samples.operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Config
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  architectures:
  - x86_64
  managementState: Removed
```


# Cluster Samples Operator tracking and error recovery of image stream imports

After creation or update of a samples image stream, the Cluster Samples Operator monitors the progress of each image stream tag&#8217;s image import.

If an import fails, the Cluster Samples Operator retries the import through the image stream image import API at a rate of about every 15 minutes until either one of the following occurs:

* The import succeeds.
* The Cluster Samples Operator configuration is changed such that either the image stream is added to the skippedImagestreams list, or the management state is changed to Removed.

## Cluster Samples Operator assistance for mirroring

During installation, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform creates a config map named imagestreamtag-to-image in the openshift-cluster-samples-operator namespace.

The imagestreamtag-to-image config map contains an entry, the populating image, for each image stream tag.

The format of the key for each entry in the data field in the config map is <image_stream_name>_<image_stream_tag_name>.

During a disconnected installation of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, the status of the Cluster Samples Operator is set to Removed. If you choose to change it to Managed, it installs samples.


[NOTE]
----
The use of samples in a network-restricted or discontinued environment might require access to services external to your network. Some example services include: Github, Maven Central, npm, RubyGems, PyPi and others. There might be additional steps to take that allow the Cluster Samples Operators objects to reach the services they require.
----

Use the following principles to determine which images you need to mirror for your image streams to import:

* While the Cluster Samples Operator is set to Removed, you can create your mirrored registry, or determine which existing mirrored registry you want to use.
* Mirror the samples you want to the mirrored registry using the new config map as your guide.
* Add any of the image streams you did not mirror to the skippedImagestreams list of the Cluster Samples Operator configuration object.
* Set samplesRegistry of the Cluster Samples Operator configuration object to the mirrored registry.
* Then set the Cluster Samples Operator to Managed to install the image streams you have mirrored.

# Cluster Samples Operator configuration parameters

The samples resource offers the following configuration fields:



Secret, image stream, and template watch events can come in before the initial samples resource object is created, the Cluster Samples Operator detects and re-queues the event.

## Configuration restrictions

When the Cluster Samples Operator starts supporting multiple architectures, you cannot change the architecture list while the Operator is in the Managed state.

To change the architectures values, a cluster administrator must:

* Mark the Management State as Removed, saving the change.
* In a subsequent change, edit the architecture and change the Management State back to Managed.

The Cluster Samples Operator still processes secrets while in Removed state. You can create the secret before switching to Removed, while in Removed before switching to Managed, or after switching to Managed state. There are delays in creating the samples until the secret event is processed if you create the secret after switching to Managed. This helps facilitate the changing of the registry, where you choose to remove all the samples before switching to ensure a clean slate. Removing all samples before switching is not required.

## Samples resource conditions

The samples resource maintains the following conditions in its status:



# Accessing the Cluster Samples Operator configuration

You can configure the Cluster Samples Operator by editing the file with the provided parameters.

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* Access the Cluster Samples Operator configuration by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc edit configs.samples.operator.openshift.io/cluster
```


The Cluster Samples Operator configuration resembles the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: samples.operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Config
# ...
```


# Removing deprecated image stream tags from the Cluster Samples Operator

The Cluster Samples Operator leaves deprecated image stream tags in an image stream because users can have deployments that use the deprecated image stream tags.

You can remove deprecated image stream tags by editing the image stream with the  oc tag command.


[NOTE]
----
Deprecated image stream tags that the samples providers have removed from their image streams are not included on initial installations.
----

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* Remove deprecated image stream tags by editing the image stream with the following oc tag command:

```terminal
$ oc tag -d <image_stream_name:tag>
```

Example output

```terminal
Deleted tag default/<image_stream_name:tag>.
```
