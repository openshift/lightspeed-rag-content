# Performing latency tests for platform verification


You can use the Cloud-native Network Functions (CNF) tests image to run latency tests on a CNF-enabled Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, where all the components required for running CNF workloads are installed. Run the latency tests to validate node tuning for your workload.
The cnf-tests container image is available at registry.redhat.io/openshift4/cnf-tests-rhel9:v4.22.

# Prerequisites for running latency tests

Your cluster must meet the following requirements before you can run the latency tests:

* You have applied all the required CNF configurations. This includes the PerformanceProfile cluster and other configuration according to the reference design specifications (RDS) or your specific requirements.
* You have logged in to registry.redhat.io with your Customer Portal credentials by using the podman login command.

* Scheduling a workload onto a worker with real-time capabilities

# Measuring latency

The cnf-tests image uses three tools to measure the latency of the system:

* hwlatdetect
* cyclictest
* oslat

Each tool has a specific use. Use the tools in sequence to achieve reliable test results.

hwlatdetect:: Measures the baseline that the bare-metal hardware can achieve. Before proceeding with the next latency test, ensure that the latency reported by hwlatdetect meets the required threshold because you cannot fix hardware latency spikes by operating system tuning.
cyclictest:: Verifies the real-time kernel scheduler latency after hwlatdetect passes validation. The cyclictest tool schedules a repeated timer and measures the difference between the desired and the actual trigger times. The difference can uncover basic issues with the tuning caused by interrupts or process priorities. The tool must run on a real-time kernel.
oslat:: Behaves similarly to a CPU-intensive DPDK application and measures all the interruptions and disruptions to the busy loop that simulates CPU heavy data processing.

The tests introduce the following environment variables:




[NOTE]
----
Variables that are specific to a latency tool take precedence over unified variables. For example, if OSLAT_MAXIMUM_LATENCY is set to 30 microseconds and MAXIMUM_LATENCY is set to 10 microseconds, the oslat test will run with maximum acceptable latency of 30 microseconds.
----

# Running the latency tests

Run the cluster latency tests to validate node tuning for your Cloud-native Network Functions (CNF) workload.


[NOTE]
----
When executing podman commands as a non-root or non-privileged user, mounting paths can fail with permission denied errors. Depending on your local operating system and SELinux configuration, you might also experience issues running these commands from your home directory. To make the podman commands work, run the commands from a folder that is not your home/<username> directory, and append :Z to the volumes creation. For example, -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z. This allows podman to do the proper SELinux relabeling.
----

This procedure runs the three individual tests hwlatdetect, cyclictest, and oslat. For details on these individual tests, see their individual sections.

1. Open a shell prompt in the directory containing the kubeconfig file.

You provide the test image with a kubeconfig file in current directory and its related $KUBECONFIG environment variable, mounted through a volume. This allows the running container to use the kubeconfig file from inside the container.

[NOTE]
----
In the following command, your local kubeconfig is mounted to kubeconfig/kubeconfig in the cnf-tests container, which allows access to the cluster.
----
2. To run the latency tests, run the following command, substituting variable values as appropriate:

```terminal
$ podman run -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z -e KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig/kubeconfig \
-e LATENCY_TEST_RUNTIME=600\
-e MAXIMUM_LATENCY=20 \
registry.redhat.io/openshift4/cnf-tests-rhel9:v4.22 /usr/bin/test-run.sh \
--ginkgo.v --ginkgo.timeout="24h"
```


The LATENCY_TEST_RUNTIME is shown in seconds, in this case 600 seconds (10 minutes). The test runs successfully when the maximum observed latency is lower than MAXIMUM_LATENCY (20 μs).

If the results exceed the latency threshold, the test fails.
3. Optional: Append --ginkgo.dry-run flag to run the latency tests in dry-run mode. This is useful for checking what commands the tests run.
4. Optional: Append --ginkgo.v flag to run the tests with increased verbosity.
5. Optional: Append --ginkgo.timeout="24h" flag to ensure the Ginkgo 2.0 test suite does not timeout before the latency tests complete.

[IMPORTANT]
----
During testing shorter time periods, as shown, can be used to run the tests. However, for final verification and valid results, the test should run for at least 12 hours (43200 seconds).
----

## Running hwlatdetect

The hwlatdetect tool is available in the rt-kernel package with a regular subscription of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9.x.


[NOTE]
----
When executing podman commands as a non-root or non-privileged user, mounting paths can fail with permission denied errors. Depending on your local operating system and SELinux configuration, you might also experience issues running these commands from your home directory. To make the podman commands work, run the commands from a folder that is not your home/<username> directory, and append :Z to the volumes creation. For example, -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z. This allows podman to do the proper SELinux relabeling.
----

* You have reviewed the prerequisites for running latency tests.

* To run the hwlatdetect tests, run the following command, substituting variable values as appropriate:

```terminal
$ podman run -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z -e KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig/kubeconfig \
-e LATENCY_TEST_RUNTIME=600 -e MAXIMUM_LATENCY=20 \
registry.redhat.io/openshift4/cnf-tests-rhel9:v4.22 \
/usr/bin/test-run.sh --ginkgo.focus="hwlatdetect" --ginkgo.v --ginkgo.timeout="24h"
```


The hwlatdetect test runs for 10 minutes (600 seconds). The test runs successfully when the maximum observed latency is lower than MAXIMUM_LATENCY (20 μs).

If the results exceed the latency threshold, the test fails.

[IMPORTANT]
----
During testing shorter time periods, as shown, can be used to run the tests. However, for final verification and valid results, the test should run for at least 12 hours (43200 seconds).

You can configure the latency threshold by using the MAXIMUM_LATENCY or the HWLATDETECT_MAXIMUM_LATENCY environment variables.
The maximum latency value measured during the test.

## Example hwlatdetect test results

You can capture the following types of results:

* Rough results that are gathered after each run to create a history of impact on any changes made throughout the test.
* The combined set of the rough tests with the best results and configuration settings.


```terminal
hwlatdetect: test duration 3600 seconds

The output of hwlatdetect shows that multiple samples exceed the threshold. However, the same output can indicate different results based on the following factors:

* The duration of the test
* The number of CPU cores
* The host firmware settings


[WARNING]
----
Before proceeding with the next latency test, ensure that the latency reported by hwlatdetect meets the required threshold. Fixing latencies introduced by hardware might require you to contact the system vendor support.
Not all latency spikes are hardware related. Ensure that you tune the host firmware to meet your workload requirements. For more information, see Setting firmware parameters for system tuning.

## Running cyclictest

The cyclictest tool measures the real-time kernel scheduler latency on the specified CPUs.


[NOTE]
----
When executing podman commands as a non-root or non-privileged user, mounting paths can fail with permission denied errors. Depending on your local operating system and SELinux configuration, you might also experience issues running these commands from your home directory. To make the podman commands work, run the commands from a folder that is not your home/<username> directory, and append :Z to the volumes creation. For example, -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z. This allows podman to do the proper SELinux relabeling.
----

* You have reviewed the prerequisites for running latency tests.

* To perform the cyclictest, run the following command, substituting variable values as appropriate:

```terminal
$ podman run -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z -e KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig/kubeconfig \
-e LATENCY_TEST_CPUS=10 -e LATENCY_TEST_RUNTIME=600 -e MAXIMUM_LATENCY=20 \
registry.redhat.io/openshift4/cnf-tests-rhel9:v4.22 \
/usr/bin/test-run.sh --ginkgo.focus="cyclictest" --ginkgo.v --ginkgo.timeout="24h"
```


The command runs the cyclictest tool for 10 minutes (600 seconds). The test runs successfully when the maximum observed latency is lower than MAXIMUM_LATENCY (in this example, 20 μs). Latency spikes of 20 μs and above are generally not acceptable for telco RAN workloads.

If the results exceed the latency threshold, the test fails.

[IMPORTANT]
----
During testing shorter time periods, as shown, can be used to run the tests. However, for final verification and valid results, the test should run for at least 12 hours (43200 seconds).

## Running oslat

The oslat test simulates a CPU-intensive DPDK application and measures all the interruptions and disruptions to test how the cluster handles CPU heavy data processing.


[NOTE]
----
When executing podman commands as a non-root or non-privileged user, mounting paths can fail with permission denied errors. Depending on your local operating system and SELinux configuration, you might also experience issues running these commands from your home directory. To make the podman commands work, run the commands from a folder that is not your home/<username> directory, and append :Z to the volumes creation. For example, -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z. This allows podman to do the proper SELinux relabeling.
----

* You have reviewed the prerequisites for running latency tests.

* To perform the oslat test, run the following command, substituting variable values as appropriate:

```terminal

LATENCY_TEST_CPUS specifies the number of CPUs to test with the oslat command.

The command runs the oslat tool for 10 minutes (600 seconds). The test runs successfully when the maximum observed latency is lower than MAXIMUM_LATENCY (20 μs).

If the results exceed the latency threshold, the test fails.

[IMPORTANT]
----
During testing shorter time periods, as shown, can be used to run the tests. However, for final verification and valid results, the test should run for at least 12 hours (43200 seconds).

# Generating a latency test failure report

Use the following procedures to generate a JUnit latency test output and test failure report.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have logged in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

* Create a test failure report with information about the cluster state and resources for troubleshooting by passing the --report parameter with the path to where the report is dumped:

```terminal
$ podman run -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z -v $(pwd)/reportdest:<report_folder_path> \
-e KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig/kubeconfig registry.redhat.io/openshift4/cnf-tests-rhel9:v4.22 \
/usr/bin/test-run.sh --report <report_folder_path> --ginkgo.v
```


where:
<report_folder_path>:: Is the path to the folder where the report is generated.

# Generating a JUnit latency test report

Use the following procedures to generate a JUnit latency test output and test failure report.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have logged in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

* Create a JUnit-compliant XML report by passing the --junit parameter together with the path to where the report is dumped:

[NOTE]
----
You must create the junit folder before running this command.
----

```terminal
$ podman run -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z -v $(pwd)/junit:/junit \
-e KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig/kubeconfig registry.redhat.io/openshift4/cnf-tests-rhel9:v4.22 \

where:
file_name:: The name of the XML report file.

# Running latency tests on a single-node OpenShift cluster

You can run latency tests on single-node OpenShift clusters.


[NOTE]
----
When executing podman commands as a non-root or non-privileged user, mounting paths can fail with permission denied errors. To make the podman command work, append :Z to the volumes creation; for example, -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z. This allows podman to do the proper SELinux relabeling.
----

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have logged in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* You have applied a cluster performance profile by using the Node Tuning Operator.

* To run the latency tests on a single-node OpenShift cluster, run the following command:

```terminal
$ podman run -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z -e KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig/kubeconfig \
-e LATENCY_TEST_RUNTIME=<time_in_seconds> registry.redhat.io/openshift4/cnf-tests-rhel9:v4.22 \
/usr/bin/test-run.sh --ginkgo.v --ginkgo.timeout="24h"
```


[NOTE]
----
The default runtime for each test is 300 seconds.
For valid latency test results, run the tests for at least 12 hours by updating the LATENCY_TEST_RUNTIME variable.
To run the buckets latency validation step, you must specify a maximum latency. For details on maximum latency variables, see the table in the "Measuring latency" section.

After running the test suite, all the dangling resources are cleaned up.

# Running latency tests in a disconnected cluster

The CNF tests image can run tests in a disconnected cluster that is not able to reach external registries. This requires two steps:

1. Mirroring the cnf-tests image to the custom disconnected registry.
2. Instructing the tests to consume the images from the custom disconnected registry.

## Mirroring the images to a custom registry accessible from the cluster

A mirror executable is shipped in the image to provide the input required by oc to mirror the test image to a local registry.

1. Run this command from an intermediate machine that has access to the cluster and registry.redhat.io:

```terminal
$ podman run -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z -e KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig/kubeconfig \
registry.redhat.io/openshift4/cnf-tests-rhel9:v4.22 \
/usr/bin/mirror -registry <disconnected_registry> | oc image mirror -f -
```


where:
<disconnected_registry>:: Is the disconnected mirror registry you have configured, for example, my.local.registry:5000/.
2. When you have mirrored the cnf-tests image into the disconnected registry, you must override the original registry used to fetch the images when running the tests, for example:

```terminal
podman run -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z -e KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig/kubeconfig \
-e IMAGE_REGISTRY="<disconnected_registry>" \
-e CNF_TESTS_IMAGE="cnf-tests-rhel9:v4.22" \
-e LATENCY_TEST_RUNTIME=<time_in_seconds> \
<disconnected_registry>/cnf-tests-rhel9:v4.22 /usr/bin/test-run.sh --ginkgo.v --ginkgo.timeout="24h"
```


## Configuring the tests to consume images from a custom registry

You can run the latency tests using a custom test image and image registry using CNF_TESTS_IMAGE and IMAGE_REGISTRY variables.

* To configure the latency tests to use a custom test image and image registry, run the following command:

```terminal
$ podman run -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z -e KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig/kubeconfig \
-e IMAGE_REGISTRY="<custom_image_registry>" \
-e CNF_TESTS_IMAGE="<custom_cnf-tests_image>" \
-e LATENCY_TEST_RUNTIME=<time_in_seconds> \
registry.redhat.io/openshift4/cnf-tests-rhel9:v4.22 /usr/bin/test-run.sh --ginkgo.v --ginkgo.timeout="24h"
```


where:
<custom_image_registry>:: is the custom image registry, for example, custom.registry:5000/.
<custom_cnf-tests_image>:: is the custom cnf-tests image, for example, custom-cnf-tests-image:latest.

## Mirroring images to the cluster OpenShift image registry

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform provides a built-in container image registry, which runs as a standard workload on the cluster.

1. Gain external access to the registry by exposing it with a route:

```terminal
$ oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster --patch '{"spec":{"defaultRoute":true}}' --type=merge
```

2. Fetch the registry endpoint by running the following command:

```terminal
$ REGISTRY=$(oc get route default-route -n openshift-image-registry --template='{{ .spec.host }}')
```

3. Create a namespace for exposing the images:

```terminal
$ oc create ns cnftests
```

4. Make the image stream available to all the namespaces used for tests. This is required to allow the tests namespaces to fetch the images from the cnf-tests image stream. Run the following commands:

```terminal
$ oc policy add-role-to-user system:image-puller system:serviceaccount:cnf-features-testing:default --namespace=cnftests
```


```terminal
$ oc policy add-role-to-user system:image-puller system:serviceaccount:performance-addon-operators-testing:default --namespace=cnftests
```

5. Retrieve the docker secret name and auth token by running the following commands:

```terminal
$ SECRET=$(oc -n cnftests get secret | grep builder-docker | awk {'print $1'}
```


```terminal
$ TOKEN=$(oc -n cnftests get secret $SECRET -o jsonpath="{.data['\.dockercfg']}" | base64 --decode | jq '.["image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000"].auth')
```

6. Create a dockerauth.json file, for example:

```bash
$ echo "{\"auths\": { \"$REGISTRY\": { \"auth\": $TOKEN } }}" > dockerauth.json
```

7. Do the image mirroring:

```terminal
$ podman run -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z -e KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig/kubeconfig \
registry.redhat.io/openshift4/cnf-tests-rhel9:v4.22 \
/usr/bin/mirror -registry $REGISTRY/cnftests |  oc image mirror --insecure=true \
-a=$(pwd)/dockerauth.json -f -
```

8. Run the tests:

```terminal
$ podman run -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z -e KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig/kubeconfig \
-e LATENCY_TEST_RUNTIME=<time_in_seconds> \
-e IMAGE_REGISTRY=image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/cnftests cnf-tests-local:latest /usr/bin/test-run.sh --ginkgo.v --ginkgo.timeout="24h"
```


## Mirroring a different set of test images

You can optionally change the default upstream images that are mirrored for the latency tests.

1. The mirror command tries to mirror the upstream images by default. This can be overridden by passing a file with the following format to the image:

```yaml
[
    {
        "registry": "public.registry.io:5000",
        "image": "imageforcnftests:4.22"
    }
]
```

2. Pass the file to the mirror command, for example saving it locally as images.json. With the following command, the local path is mounted in /kubeconfig inside the container and that can be passed to the mirror command.

```terminal
$ podman run -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z -e KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig/kubeconfig \
registry.redhat.io/openshift4/cnf-tests-rhel9:v4.22 /usr/bin/mirror \
--registry "my.local.registry:5000/" --images "/kubeconfig/images.json" \
|  oc image mirror -f -
```


# Troubleshooting errors with the cnf-tests container

To run latency tests, the cluster must be accessible from within the cnf-tests container.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have logged in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

* Verify that the cluster is accessible from inside the cnf-tests container by running the following command:

```terminal
$ podman run -v $(pwd)/:/kubeconfig:Z -e KUBECONFIG=/kubeconfig/kubeconfig \
registry.redhat.io/openshift4/cnf-tests-rhel9:v4.22 \
oc get nodes
```


If this command does not work, an error related to spanning across DNS, MTU size, or firewall access might be occurring.
