# Managing traffic in your service mesh


Using Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh, you can control the flow of traffic and API calls between services. Some services in your service mesh might need to communicate within the mesh and others might need to be hidden. You can manage the traffic to hide specific backend services, expose services, create testing or versioning deployments, or add a security layer on a set of services.

# Using gateways

You can use a gateway to manage inbound and outbound traffic for your mesh to specify which traffic you want to enter or leave the mesh. Gateway configurations are applied to standalone Envoy proxies that are running at the edge of the mesh, rather than sidecar Envoy proxies running alongside your service workloads.

Unlike other mechanisms for controlling traffic entering your systems, such as the Kubernetes Ingress APIs, Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh gateways use the full power and flexibility of traffic routing.

The Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh gateway resource can use layer 4-6 load balancing properties, such as ports, to expose and configure Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh TLS settings. Instead of adding application-layer traffic routing (L7) to the same API resource, you can bind a regular Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh virtual service to the gateway and manage gateway traffic like any other data plane traffic in a service mesh.

Gateways are primarily used to manage ingress traffic, but you can also configure egress gateways. An egress gateway lets you configure a dedicated exit node for the traffic leaving the mesh. This enables you to limit which services have access to external networks, which adds security control to your service mesh. You can also use a gateway to configure a purely internal proxy.

A gateway resource describes a load balancer operating at the edge of the mesh receiving incoming or outgoing HTTP/TCP connections. The specification describes a set of ports that should be exposed, the type of protocol to use, SNI configuration for the load balancer, and so on.

The following example shows a sample gateway configuration for external HTTPS ingress traffic:


```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: ext-host-gwy
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway # use istio default controller
  servers:
  - port:
      number: 443
      name: https
      protocol: HTTPS
    hosts:
    - ext-host.example.com
    tls:
      mode: SIMPLE
      serverCertificate: /tmp/tls.crt
      privateKey: /tmp/tls.key
```


This gateway configuration lets HTTPS traffic from ext-host.example.com into the mesh on port 443, but doesn’t specify any routing for the traffic.

To specify routing and for the gateway to work as intended, you must also bind the gateway to a virtual service. You do this using the virtual service&#8217;s gateways field, as shown in the following example:


```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: virtual-svc
spec:
  hosts:
  - ext-host.example.com
  gateways:
    - ext-host-gwy
```


You can then configure the virtual service with routing rules for the external traffic.

## Enabling gateway injection

Gateway configurations apply to standalone Envoy proxies running at the edge of the mesh, rather than sidecar Envoy proxies running alongside your service workloads. Because gateways are Envoy proxies, you can configure Service Mesh to inject gateways automatically, similar to how you can inject sidecars.

Using automatic injection for gateways, you can deploy and manage gateways independent from the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource and manage the gateways with your user applications. Using auto-injection for gateway deployments gives developers full control over the gateway deployment while simplifying operations. When a new upgrade is available, or a configuration has changed, you restart the gateway pods to update them. Doing so makes the experience of operating a gateway deployment the same as operating sidecars.


[NOTE]
----
Injection is disabled by default for the ServiceMeshControlPlane namespace, for example the istio-system namespace. As a security best practice, deploy gateways in a different namespace from the control plane.
----

## Deploying automatic gateway injection

When deploying a gateway, you must opt-in to injection by adding an injection label or annotation to the gateway deployment object. The following example deploys a gateway.

* The namespace must be a member of the mesh by defining it in the ServiceMeshMemberRoll or by creating a ServiceMeshMember resource.

1. Set a unique label for the Istio ingress gateway. This setting is required to ensure that the gateway can select the workload. This example uses ingressgateway as the name of the gateway.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: istio-ingressgateway
  namespace: istio-ingress
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway
  ports:
  - name: http2
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  - name: https
    port: 443
    targetPort: 8443
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: istio-ingressgateway
  namespace: istio-ingress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      istio: ingressgateway
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        inject.istio.io/templates: gateway
      labels:
        istio: ingressgateway
        sidecar.istio.io/inject: "true" 1
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: istio-proxy
        image: auto 2
```

Enable gateway injection by setting the sidecar.istio.io/inject field to "true".
Set the image field to auto so that the image automatically updates each time the pod starts.
2. Set up roles to allow reading credentials for TLS.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: istio-ingressgateway-sds
  namespace: istio-ingress
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["secrets"]
    verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: istio-ingressgateway-sds
  namespace: istio-ingress
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: istio-ingressgateway-sds
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: default
```

3. Grant access to the new gateway from outside the cluster, which is required whenever spec.security.manageNetworkPolicy is set to true.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: gatewayingress
  namespace: istio-ingress
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      istio: ingressgateway
  ingress:
    - {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
```

4. Automatically scale the pod when ingress traffic increases. This example sets the minimum replicas to 2 and the maximum replicas to 5. It also creates another replica when utilization reaches 80%.

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  labels:
    istio: ingressgateway
    release: istio
  name: ingressgatewayhpa
  namespace: istio-ingress
spec:
  maxReplicas: 5
  metrics:
  - resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        averageUtilization: 80
        type: Utilization
    type: Resource
  minReplicas: 2
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: istio-ingressgateway
```

5. Specify the minimum number of pods that must be running on the node. This example ensures one replica is running if a pod gets restarted on a new node.

```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  labels:
    istio: ingressgateway
    release: istio
  name: ingressgatewaypdb
  namespace: istio-ingress
spec:
  minAvailable: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      istio: ingressgateway
```


## Managing ingress traffic

In Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh, the Ingress Gateway enables features such as monitoring, security, and route rules to apply to traffic that enters the cluster. Use a Service Mesh gateway to expose a service outside of the service mesh.

### Determining the ingress IP and ports

Ingress configuration differs depending on if your environment supports an external load balancer. An external load balancer is set in the ingress IP and ports for the cluster. To determine if your cluster&#8217;s IP and ports are configured for external load balancers, run the following command. In this example, istio-system is the name of the Service Mesh control plane project.


```terminal
$ oc get svc istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system
```


That command returns the NAME, TYPE, CLUSTER-IP, EXTERNAL-IP, PORT(S), and AGE of each item in your namespace.

If the EXTERNAL-IP value is set, your environment has an external load balancer that you can use for the ingress gateway.

If the EXTERNAL-IP value is <none>, or perpetually <pending>, your environment does not provide an external load balancer for the ingress gateway.

#### Determining ingress ports with a load balancer

Follow these instructions if your environment has an external load balancer.

1. Run the following command to set the ingress IP and ports. This command sets a variable in your terminal.

```terminal
$ export INGRESS_HOST=$(oc -n istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
```

2. Run the following command to set the ingress port.

```terminal
$ export INGRESS_PORT=$(oc -n istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[?(@.name=="http2")].port}')
```

3. Run the following command to set the secure ingress port.

```terminal
$ export SECURE_INGRESS_PORT=$(oc -n istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[?(@.name=="https")].port}')
```

4. Run the following command to set the TCP ingress port.

```terminal
$ export TCP_INGRESS_PORT=$(kubectl -n istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[?(@.name=="tcp")].port}')
```



[NOTE]
----
In some environments, the load balancer may be exposed using a hostname instead of an IP address. For that case, the ingress gateway's EXTERNAL-IP value is not an IP address. Instead, it is a hostname, and the previous command fails to set the INGRESS_HOST environment variable.
In that case, use the following command to correct the INGRESS_HOST value:
----


```terminal
$ export INGRESS_HOST=$(oc -n istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}')
```


#### Determining ingress ports without a load balancer

If your environment does not have an external load balancer, determine the ingress ports and use a node port instead.

1. Set the ingress ports.

```terminal
$ export INGRESS_PORT=$(oc -n istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[?(@.name=="http2")].nodePort}')
```

2. Run the following command to set the secure ingress port.

```terminal
$ export SECURE_INGRESS_PORT=$(oc -n istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[?(@.name=="https")].nodePort}')
```

3. Run the following command to set the TCP ingress port.

```terminal
$ export TCP_INGRESS_PORT=$(kubectl -n istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[?(@.name=="tcp")].nodePort}')
```


## Configuring an ingress gateway

An ingress gateway is a load balancer operating at the edge of the mesh that receives incoming HTTP/TCP connections. It configures exposed ports and protocols but does not include any traffic routing configuration. Traffic routing for ingress traffic is instead configured with routing rules, the same way as for internal service requests.

The following steps show how to create a gateway and configure a VirtualService to expose a service in the Bookinfo sample application to outside traffic for paths /productpage and /login.

1. Create a gateway to accept traffic.
1. Create a YAML file, and copy the following YAML into it.
Gateway example gateway.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: bookinfo-gateway
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway
  servers:
  - port:
      number: 80
      name: http
      protocol: HTTP
    hosts:
    - "*"
```

2. Apply the YAML file.

```terminal
$ oc apply -f gateway.yaml
```

2. Create a VirtualService object to rewrite the host header.
1. Create a YAML file, and copy the following YAML into it.
Virtual service example

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: bookinfo
spec:
  hosts:
  - "*"
  gateways:
  - bookinfo-gateway
  http:
  - match:
    - uri:
        exact: /productpage
    - uri:
        prefix: /static
    - uri:
        exact: /login
    - uri:
        exact: /logout
    - uri:
        prefix: /api/v1/products
    route:
    - destination:
        host: productpage
        port:
          number: 9080
```

2. Apply the YAML file.

```terminal
$ oc apply -f vs.yaml
```

3. Test that the gateway and VirtualService have been set correctly.
1. Set the Gateway URL.

```terminal
export GATEWAY_URL=$(oc -n istio-system get route istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
```

2. Set the port number. In this example, istio-system is the name of the Service Mesh control plane project.

```terminal
export TARGET_PORT=$(oc -n istio-system get route istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.port.targetPort}')
```

3. Test a page that has been explicitly exposed.

```terminal
curl -s -I "$GATEWAY_URL/productpage"
```


The expected result is 200.

# Understanding automatic routes


[IMPORTANT]
----
{FeatureName} is a deprecated feature. Deprecated functionality is still included in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and continues to be supported; however, it will be removed in a future release of this product and is not recommended for new deployments.
For the most recent list of major functionality that has been deprecated or removed within Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, refer to the Deprecated and removed features section of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release notes.
----

OpenShift routes for gateways are automatically managed in Service Mesh. Every time an Istio Gateway is created, updated or deleted inside the service mesh, an OpenShift route is created, updated or deleted.


[NOTE]
----
Starting with Service Mesh 2.5, automatic routes are disabled by default for new instances of the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource.
----

## Routes with subdomains

Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh creates the route with the subdomain, but Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform must be configured to enable it. Subdomains, for example *.domain.com, are supported, but not by default. Configure an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform wildcard policy before configuring a wildcard host gateway.

## Creating subdomain routes

The following example creates a gateway in the Bookinfo sample application, which creates subdomain routes.


```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: gateway1
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway
  servers:
  - port:
      number: 80
      name: http
      protocol: HTTP
    hosts:
    - www.bookinfo.com
    - bookinfo.example.com
```


The Gateway resource creates the following OpenShift routes. You can check that the routes are created by using the following command. In this example, istio-system is the name of the Service Mesh control plane project.


```terminal
$ oc -n istio-system get routes
```



```terminal
NAME           HOST/PORT             PATH  SERVICES               PORT  TERMINATION   WILDCARD
gateway1-lvlfn bookinfo.example.com        istio-ingressgateway   <all>               None
gateway1-scqhv www.bookinfo.com            istio-ingressgateway   <all>               None
```


If you delete the gateway, Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh deletes the routes. However, routes you have manually created are never modified by Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh.

## Route labels and annotations

Sometimes specific labels or annotations are needed in an OpenShift route.

For this and other use cases, Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh will copy all labels and annotations present in the Istio gateway resource (with the exception of annotations starting with kubectl.kubernetes.io) into the managed OpenShift route resource.

If you need specific labels or annotations in the OpenShift routes created by Service Mesh, create them in the Istio gateway resource and they will be copied into the OpenShift route resources managed by the Service Mesh.

## Disabling automatic route creation

By default, the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource automatically synchronizes the Istio gateway resources with OpenShift routes. Disabling the automatic route creation allows you more flexibility to control routes if you have a special case or prefer to control routes manually.

### Disabling automatic route creation for specific cases

If you want to disable the automatic management of OpenShift routes for a specific Istio gateway, you must add the annotation maistra.io/manageRoute: false to the gateway metadata definition. Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh will ignore Istio gateways with this annotation, while keeping the automatic management of the other Istio gateways.

### Disabling automatic route creation for all cases

You can disable the automatic management of OpenShift routes for all gateways in your mesh.

Disable integration between Istio gateways and OpenShift routes by setting the ServiceMeshControlPlane field gateways.openshiftRoute.enabled to false. For example, see the following resource snippet.


```yaml
apiVersion: maistra.io/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceMeshControlPlane
metadata:
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  gateways:
    openshiftRoute:
      enabled: false
```


# Understanding service entries

A service entry adds an entry to the service registry that Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh maintains internally. After you add the service entry, the Envoy proxies send traffic to the service as if it is a service in your mesh. Service entries allow you to do the following:

* Manage traffic for services that run outside of the service mesh.
* Redirect and forward traffic for external destinations (such as, APIs consumed from the web) or traffic to services in legacy infrastructure.
* Define retry, timeout, and fault injection policies for external destinations.
* Run a mesh service in a Virtual Machine (VM) by adding VMs to your mesh.


[NOTE]
----
Add services from a different cluster to the mesh to configure a multicluster Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh mesh on Kubernetes.
----

The following example is a mesh-external service entry that adds the ext-resource external dependency to the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh service registry:


```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: ServiceEntry
metadata:
  name: svc-entry
spec:
  hosts:
  - ext-svc.example.com
  ports:
  - number: 443
    name: https
    protocol: HTTPS
  location: MESH_EXTERNAL
  resolution: DNS
```


Specify the external resource using the hosts field. You can qualify it fully or use a wildcard prefixed domain name.

You can configure virtual services and destination rules to control traffic to a service entry in the same way you configure traffic for any other service in the mesh. For example, the following destination rule configures the traffic route to use mutual TLS to secure the connection to the ext-svc.example.com external service that is configured using the service entry:


```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: ext-res-dr
spec:
  host: ext-svc.example.com
  trafficPolicy:
    tls:
      mode: MUTUAL
      clientCertificate: /etc/certs/myclientcert.pem
      privateKey: /etc/certs/client_private_key.pem
      caCertificates: /etc/certs/rootcacerts.pem
```


# Using VirtualServices

You can route requests dynamically to multiple versions of a microservice through Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh with a virtual service. With virtual services, you can:

* Address multiple application services through a single virtual service. If your mesh uses Kubernetes, for example, you can configure a virtual service to handle all services in a specific namespace. A virtual service enables you to turn a monolithic application into a service consisting of distinct microservices with a seamless consumer experience.
* Configure traffic rules in combination with gateways to control ingress and egress traffic.

## Configuring VirtualServices

Requests are routed to services within a service mesh with virtual services. Each virtual service consists of a set of routing rules that are evaluated in order. Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh matches each given request to the virtual service to a specific real destination within the mesh.

Without virtual services, Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh distributes traffic using least requests load balancing between all service instances. With a virtual service, you can specify traffic behavior for one or more hostnames. Routing rules in the virtual service tell Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh how to send the traffic for the virtual service to appropriate destinations. Route destinations can be versions of the same service or entirely different services.

1. Create a YAML file using the following example to route requests to different versions of the Bookinfo sample application service depending on which user connects to the application.
Example VirtualService.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews
  http:
  - match:
    - headers:
        end-user:
          exact: jason
    route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v2
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v3
```

2. Run the following command to apply VirtualService.yaml, where VirtualService.yaml is the path to the file.

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <VirtualService.yaml>
```


## VirtualService configuration reference



# Understanding destination rules

Destination rules are applied after virtual service routing rules are evaluated, so they apply to the traffic&#8217;s real destination. Virtual services route traffic to a destination. Destination rules configure what happens to traffic at that destination.

By default, Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh uses a least requests load balancing policy, where the service instance in the pool with the least number of active connections receives the request. Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh also supports the following models, which you can specify in destination rules for requests to a particular service or service subset.

* Random: Requests are forwarded at random to instances in the pool.
* Weighted: Requests are forwarded to instances in the pool according to a specific percentage.
* Least requests: Requests are forwarded to instances with the least number of requests.

The following example destination rule configures three different subsets for the my-svc destination service, with different load balancing policies:


```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: my-destination-rule
spec:
  host: my-svc
  trafficPolicy:
    loadBalancer:
      simple: RANDOM
  subsets:
  - name: v1
    labels:
      version: v1
  - name: v2
    labels:
      version: v2
    trafficPolicy:
      loadBalancer:
        simple: ROUND_ROBIN
  - name: v3
    labels:
      version: v3
```


# Understanding network policies

Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh automatically creates and manages a number of NetworkPolicies resources in the Service Mesh control plane and application namespaces. This is to ensure that applications and the control plane can communicate with each other.

For example, if you have configured your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster to use the SDN plugin, Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh creates a NetworkPolicy resource in each member project. This enables ingress to all pods in the mesh from the other mesh members and the control plane. This also restricts ingress to only member projects. If you require ingress from non-member projects, you need to create a NetworkPolicy to allow that traffic through. If you remove a namespace from Service Mesh, this NetworkPolicy resource is deleted from the project.

## Disabling automatic NetworkPolicy creation

If you want to disable the automatic creation and management of NetworkPolicy resources, for example to enforce company security policies, or to allow direct access to pods in the mesh, you can do so. You can edit the ServiceMeshControlPlane and set spec.security.manageNetworkPolicy to false.


[NOTE]
----
When you disable spec.security.manageNetworkPolicy Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh will not create any NetworkPolicy objects. The system administrator is responsible for managing the network and fixing any issues this might cause.
----

* Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator version 2.1.1 or higher installed.
* ServiceMeshControlPlane resource updated to version 2.1 or higher.

1. In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, click Ecosystem -> Installed Operators.
2. Select the project where you installed the Service Mesh control plane, for example istio-system, from the Project menu.
3. Click the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator. In the Istio Service Mesh Control Plane column, click the name of your ServiceMeshControlPlane, for example basic-install.
4. On the Create ServiceMeshControlPlane Details page, click YAML to modify your configuration.
5. Set the ServiceMeshControlPlane field spec.security.manageNetworkPolicy to false, as shown in this example.

```yaml
apiVersion: maistra.io/v2
kind: ServiceMeshControlPlane
spec:
  security:
      manageNetworkPolicy: false
```

6. Click Save.

# Configuring sidecars for traffic management

By default, Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh configures every Envoy proxy to accept traffic on all the ports of its associated workload, and to reach every workload in the mesh when forwarding traffic. You can use a sidecar configuration to do the following:

* Fine-tune the set of ports and protocols that an Envoy proxy accepts.
* Limit the set of services that the Envoy proxy can reach.


[NOTE]
----
To optimize performance of your service mesh, consider limiting Envoy proxy configurations.
----

In the Bookinfo sample application, configure a Sidecar so all services can reach other services running in the same namespace and control plane. This Sidecar configuration is required for using Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh policy and telemetry features.

1. Create a YAML file using the following example to specify that you want a sidecar configuration to apply to all workloads in a particular namespace. Otherwise, choose specific workloads using a workloadSelector.
Example sidecar.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Sidecar
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: bookinfo
spec:
  egress:
  - hosts:
    - "./*"
    - "istio-system/*"
```

2. Run the following command to apply sidecar.yaml, where sidecar.yaml is the path to the file.

```terminal
$ oc apply -f sidecar.yaml
```

3. Run the following command to verify that the sidecar was created successfully.

```terminal
$ oc get sidecar
```


# Routing Tutorial

This guide references the Bookinfo sample application to provide examples of routing in an example application. Install the Bookinfo application to learn how these routing examples work.

## Bookinfo routing tutorial

The Service Mesh Bookinfo sample application consists of four separate microservices, each with multiple versions. After installing the Bookinfo sample application, three different versions of the reviews microservice run concurrently.

When you access the Bookinfo app /product page in a browser and refresh several times, sometimes the book review output contains star ratings and other times it does not. Without an explicit default service version to route to, Service Mesh routes requests to all available versions one after the other.

This tutorial helps you apply rules that route all traffic to v1 (version 1) of the microservices. Later, you can apply a rule to route traffic based on the value of an HTTP request header.

* Deploy the Bookinfo sample application to work with the following examples.

## Applying a virtual service

In the following procedure, the virtual service routes all traffic to v1 of each micro-service by applying virtual services that set the default version for the micro-services.

1. Apply the virtual services.

```bash
$ oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio/maistra-2.6/samples/bookinfo/networking/virtual-service-all-v1.yaml
```

2. To verify that you applied the virtual services, display the defined routes with the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get virtualservices -o yaml
```


That command returns a resource of kind: VirtualService in YAML format.

You have configured Service Mesh to route to the v1 version of the Bookinfo microservices including the reviews service version 1.

## Testing the new route configuration

Test the new configuration by refreshing the /productpage of the Bookinfo application.

1. Set the value for the GATEWAY_URL parameter. You can use this variable to find the URL for your Bookinfo product page later. In this example, istio-system is the name of the control plane project.

```terminal
export GATEWAY_URL=$(oc -n istio-system get route istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
```

2. Run the following command to retrieve the URL for the product page.

```terminal
echo "http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage"
```

3. Open the Bookinfo site in your browser.

The reviews part of the page displays with no rating stars, no matter how many times you refresh. This is because you configured Service Mesh to route all traffic for the reviews service to the version reviews:v1 and this version of the service does not access the star ratings service.

Your service mesh now routes traffic to one version of a service.

## Route based on user identity

Change the route configuration so that all traffic from a specific user is routed to a specific service version. In this case, all traffic from a user named jason will be routed to the service reviews:v2.

Service Mesh does not have any special, built-in understanding of user identity. This example is enabled by the fact that the productpage service adds a custom end-user header to all outbound HTTP requests to the reviews service.
