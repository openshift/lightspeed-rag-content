# Removing the Distributed Tracing Platform


The steps for removing the Red Hat OpenShift Distributed Tracing Platform from an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster are as follows:
1. Shut down all Distributed Tracing Platform pods.
2. Remove any TempoStack instances.
3. Remove the Tempo Operator.

# Removing by using the web console

You can remove a TempoStack instance in the Administrator view of the web console.

* You are logged in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console as a cluster administrator with the cluster-admin role.
* For Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated, you must be logged in using an account with the dedicated-admin role.

1. Go to Ecosystem -> Installed Operators -> Tempo Operator -> TempoStack.
2. To remove the TempoStack instance, select Options menu -> Delete TempoStack -> Delete.
3. Optional: Remove the Tempo Operator.

# Removing by using the CLI

You can remove a TempoStack instance on the command line.

* An active OpenShift CLI (`oc`) session by a cluster administrator with the cluster-admin role.

[TIP]
----
* Ensure that your OpenShift CLI (`oc`) version is up to date and matches your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version.
* Run oc login:

```terminal
$ oc login --username=<your_username>
```
