# Exporters


Exporters send data to one or more back ends or destinations. An exporter can be push or pull based. By default, no exporters are configured. One or more exporters must be configured. Exporters can support one or more data sources. Exporters might be used with their default settings, but many exporters require configuration to specify at least the destination and security settings.
Currently, the following General Availability and Technology Preview exporters are available for the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry:

# OTLP Exporter

The OTLP gRPC Exporter exports traces and metrics by using the OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP).


```yaml
# ...
  config:
    exporters:
      otlp:
        endpoint: tempo-ingester:4317 1
        tls: 2
          ca_file: ca.pem
          cert_file: cert.pem
          key_file: key.pem
          insecure: false 3
          insecure_skip_verify: false # 4
          reload_interval: 1h 5
          server_name_override: <name> 6
        headers: 7
          X-Scope-OrgID: "dev"
    service:
      pipelines:
        traces:
          exporters: [otlp]
        metrics:
          exporters: [otlp]
# ...
```


The OTLP gRPC endpoint. If the https:// scheme is used, then client transport security is enabled and overrides the insecure setting in the tls.
The client-side TLS configuration. Defines paths to TLS certificates.
Disables client transport security when set to true. The default value is false by default.
Skips verifying the certificate when set to true. The default value is false.
Specifies the time interval at which the certificate is reloaded. If the value is not set, the certificate is never reloaded. The reload_interval accepts a string containing valid units of time such as ns, us or µs, ms, s, m, h.
Overrides the virtual hostname of authority such as the authority header field in requests. You can use this for testing.
Headers are sent for every request performed during an established connection.

# OTLP HTTP Exporter

The OTLP HTTP Exporter exports traces and metrics by using the OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP).


```yaml
# ...
  config:
    exporters:
      otlphttp:
        endpoint: http://tempo-ingester:4318 1
        tls: 2
        headers: 3
          X-Scope-OrgID: "dev"
        disable_keep_alives: false 4

    service:
      pipelines:
        traces:
          exporters: [otlphttp]
        metrics:
          exporters: [otlphttp]
# ...
```


The OTLP HTTP endpoint. If the https:// scheme is used, then client transport security is enabled and overrides the insecure setting in the tls.
The client side TLS configuration. Defines paths to TLS certificates.
Headers are sent in every HTTP request.
If true, disables HTTP keep-alives. It will only use the connection to the server for a single HTTP request.

# Debug Exporter

The Debug Exporter prints traces and metrics to the standard output.


```yaml
# ...
  config:
    exporters:
      debug:
        verbosity: detailed 1
        sampling_initial: 5 2
        sampling_thereafter: 200 3
        use_internal_logger: true 4
    service:
      pipelines:
        traces:
          exporters: [debug]
        metrics:
          exporters: [debug]
# ...
```


Verbosity of the debug export: detailed, normal, or basic. When set to detailed, pipeline data are verbosely logged. Defaults to normal.
Initial number of messages logged per second. The default value is 2 messages per second.
Sampling rate after the initial number of messages, the value in sampling_initial, has been logged. Disabled by default with the default 1 value. Sampling is enabled with values greater than 1. For more information, see the page for the sampler function in the zapcore package on the Go Project's website.
When set to true, enables output from the Collector's internal logger for the exporter.

# Load Balancing Exporter

```


The network endpoint where the metrics are exposed. The Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator automatically exposes the port specified in the endpoint field to the <instance_name>-collector service.
The server-side TLS configuration. Defines paths to TLS certificates.
If set, exports metrics under the provided value.
Key-value pair labels that are applied for every exported metric.
If true, metrics are exported by using the OpenMetrics format. Exemplars are only exported in the OpenMetrics format and only for histogram and monotonic sum metrics such as counter. Disabled by default.
If enabled is true, all the resource attributes are converted to metric labels. Disabled by default.
Defines how long metrics are exposed without updates. The default is 5m.
Adds the metrics types and units suffixes. Must be disabled if the monitor tab in the Jaeger console is enabled. The default is true.


[NOTE]
----
When the spec.observability.metrics.enableMetrics field in the OpenTelemetryCollector custom resource (CR) is set to true, the OpenTelemetryCollector CR automatically creates a Prometheus ServiceMonitor or PodMonitor CR to enable Prometheus to scrape your metrics.
