# Network flows format reference


Review the specifications for the network flow format, which is used internally and for exporting flow data to Kafka.

# Network Flows format reference

This is the specification of the network flows format. That format is used when a Kafka exporter is configured, for Prometheus metrics labels as well as internally for the Loki store.

The "Filter ID" column shows which related name to use when defining Quick Filters (see spec.consolePlugin.quickFilters in the FlowCollector specification).

The "Loki label" column is useful when querying Loki directly: label fields need to be selected using stream selectors.

The "Cardinality" column gives information about the implied metric cardinality if this field was to be used as a Prometheus label with the FlowMetrics API. Refer to the FlowMetrics documentation for more information on using this API.
