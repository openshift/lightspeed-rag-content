# Release notes


This release of the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) provides bug fixes for running Windows compute nodes in an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

# Release notes for Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator 10.21.0

Issued: 03 February 2026

## New features and improvements

### Kubernetes upgrade

The WMCO now uses Kubernetes version 1.34.

### WICD can access only the node its running on

The Windows Instance Config Daemon (WICD) on each Windows node now has permission to access only the node that it is installed on. The WICD having write access to only one node increases cluster security.

## Bug fixes

* Before this update, during secret reconciliations, secret change data was being added to the logs on each reconciliation loop. As a result, the secret change data was persisting, causing the logs to grow in size with unrelated data. With this release, only the current secret change data is being logged. As a result, the size and complexity of the logs is reduced. (OCPBUGS-61122)
* Before this update, the hybridOverlay service was not using the trusted CA bundle when connecting to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, because the --k8s-cacert option was missing from the service command. Because of this, users could encounter trust issues or failures when the hybridOverlay service attempted to communicate securely with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters using custom or internal CAs. With this release, the hybridOverlay service command now includes the --k8s-cacert flag pointing to the trusted CA bundle. As a result, the hybridOverlay service uses the trusted CA bundle for secure communication, preventing trust issues and ensuring compatibility with the cluster. (OCPBUGS-64719)
* Before this update, an error message regarding a cache not being started was being printed to the logs at WMCO start up. This error had no impact on functionality. The check causing the error message has been removed, and it will no longer log the error. (OCPBUGS-62815)
