# Collecting data for Red Hat Support

You can use the oc adm must-gather CLI command to collect the information about your Red Hat build of Kueue instance that is most likely needed for debugging issues, including:

* Red Hat build of Kueue custom resources, such as workloads, cluster queues, local queues, resource flavors, admission checks, and their corresponding cluster resource definitions (CRDs)
* Services
* Endpoints
* Webhook configurations
* Logs from the openshift-kueue-operator namespace and kueue-controller-manager pods

Collected data is written into a new directory named must-gather/ in the current working directory by default.

* The Red Hat build of Kueue Operator is installed on your cluster.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

1. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the must-gather data.
2. Collect must-gather data by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc adm must-gather \
  --image=registry.redhat.io/kueue/kueue-must-gather-rhel9:<version>
```


Where <version> is your current version of Red Hat build of Kueue.
3. Create a compressed file from the must-gather directory that was just created in your working directory. Make sure you provide the date and cluster ID for the unique must-gather data. For more information about how to find the cluster ID, see How to find the cluster-id or name on OpenShift cluster.
4. Attach the compressed file to your support case on the the Customer Support page of the Red Hat Customer Portal.
