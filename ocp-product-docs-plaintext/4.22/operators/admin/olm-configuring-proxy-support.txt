# Configuring proxy support in Operator Lifecycle Manager


If a global proxy is configured on your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically configures Operators that it manages with the cluster-wide proxy. However, you can also configure installed Operators to override the global proxy or inject a custom CA certificate.
* Configuring the cluster-wide proxy
* Configuring a custom PKI (custom CA certificate)

# Overriding proxy settings of an Operator

If a cluster-wide egress proxy is configured, Operators running with Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) inherit the cluster-wide proxy settings on their deployments.
Cluster administrators
can also override these proxy settings by configuring the subscription of an Operator.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Operators must handle setting environment variables for proxy settings in the pods for any managed Operands.
----

* Access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster using an account with

1. Navigate in the web console to the Ecosystem → Software Catalog page.
2. Select the Operator and click Install.
3. On the Install Operator page, modify the Subscription object to include one or more of the following environment variables in the spec section:
* HTTP_PROXY
* HTTPS_PROXY
* NO_PROXY

For example:
Subscription object with proxy setting overrides

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: etcd-config-test
  namespace: openshift-operators
spec:
  config:
    env:
    - name: HTTP_PROXY
      value: test_http
    - name: HTTPS_PROXY
      value: test_https
    - name: NO_PROXY
      value: test
  channel: clusterwide-alpha
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
  name: etcd
  source: community-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
  startingCSV: etcdoperator.v0.9.4-clusterwide
```


[NOTE]
----
These environment variables can also be unset using an empty value to remove any previously set cluster-wide or custom proxy settings.
----

OLM handles these environment variables as a unit; if at least one of them is set, all three are considered overridden and the cluster-wide defaults are not used for the deployments of the subscribed Operator.
4. Click Install to make the Operator available to the selected namespaces.
5. After the CSV for the Operator appears in the relevant namespace, you can verify that custom proxy environment variables are set in the deployment. For example, using the CLI:

```terminal
$ oc get deployment -n openshift-operators \
    etcd-operator -o yaml \
    | grep -i "PROXY" -A 2
```

Example output

```terminal
        - name: HTTP_PROXY
          value: test_http
        - name: HTTPS_PROXY
          value: test_https
        - name: NO_PROXY
          value: test

# Injecting a custom CA certificate

When a cluster administrator
adds a custom CA certificate to a cluster using a config map, the Cluster Network Operator merges the user-provided certificates and system CA certificates into a single bundle. You can inject this merged bundle into your Operator running on Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), which is useful if you have a man-in-the-middle HTTPS proxy.

* Access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster using an account with
* Custom CA certificate added to the cluster using a config map.
* Desired Operator installed and running on OLM.

1. Create an empty config map in the namespace where the subscription for your Operator exists and include the following label:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: trusted-ca 1
  labels:
    config.openshift.io/inject-trusted-cabundle: "true" 2
```

Name of the config map.
Requests the Cluster Network Operator to inject the merged bundle.

After creating this config map, it is immediately populated with the certificate contents of the merged bundle.
2. Update the Subscription object to include a spec.config section that mounts the trusted-ca config map as a volume to each container within a pod that requires a custom CA:

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: my-operator
spec:
  package: etcd
  channel: alpha
  config: 1
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        <labels_for_pods> 2
    volumes: 3
    - name: trusted-ca
      configMap:
        name: trusted-ca
        items:
          - key: ca-bundle.crt 4
            path: tls-ca-bundle.pem 5
    volumeMounts: 6
    - name: trusted-ca
      mountPath: /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem
      readOnly: true
```

Add a config section if it does not exist.
Specify labels to match pods that are owned by the Operator.
Create a trusted-ca volume.
ca-bundle.crt is required as the config map key.
tls-ca-bundle.pem is required as the config map path.
Create a trusted-ca volume mount.

[NOTE]
----
Deployments of an Operator can fail to validate the authority and display a x509 certificate signed by unknown authority error. This error can occur even after injecting a custom CA when using the subscription of an Operator. In this case, you can set the mountPath as /etc/ssl/certs for trusted-ca by using the subscription of an Operator.
