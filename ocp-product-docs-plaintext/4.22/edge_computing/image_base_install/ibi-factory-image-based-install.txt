# Preinstalling single-node OpenShift using an image-based installation


Use the openshift-install program to create a live installation ISO for preinstalling single-node OpenShift on bare-metal hosts. For more information about downloading the installation program, see "Installation process" in the "Additional resources" section.
The installation program takes a seed image URL and other inputs, such as the release version of the seed image and the disk to use for the installation process, and creates a live installation ISO. You can then start the host using the live installation ISO to begin preinstallation. When preinstallation is complete, the host is ready to ship to a remote site for the final site-specific configuration and deployment.
The following are the high-level steps to preinstall a single-node OpenShift cluster using an image-based installation:
* Generate a seed image.
* Create a live installation ISO using the openshift-install installation program.
* Boot the host using the live installation ISO to preinstall the host.
* Installation process

# Creating a live installation ISO for a single-node OpenShift image-based installation

You can embed your single-node OpenShift seed image URL, and other installation artifacts, in a live installation ISO by using the openshift-install program.


[NOTE]
----
For more information about the specification for the image-based-installation-config.yaml manifest, see the section "Reference specifications for the image-based-installation-config.yaml manifest".
----

* You generated a seed image from a single-node OpenShift seed cluster.
* You downloaded the openshift-install program. The version of the openshift-install program must match the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version in your seed image.
* The target host has network access to the seed image URL and all other installation artifacts.
* If you require static networking, you must install the nmstatectl library on the host that creates the live installation ISO.

1. Create a live installation ISO and embed your single-node OpenShift seed image URL and other installation artifacts:
1. Create a working directory by running the following:

```terminal
$ mkdir ibi-iso-workdir 1
```

Replace ibi-iso-workdir with the name of your working directory.
2. Optional. Create an installation configuration template to use as a reference when configuring the ImageBasedInstallationConfig resource:

```terminal
$ openshift-install image-based create image-config-template --dir ibi-iso-workdir 1
```

If you do not specify a working directory, the command uses the current directory.
Example output

```terminal
INFO Image-Config-Template created in: ibi-iso-workdir
```


The command creates the image-based-installation-config.yaml installation configuration template in your target directory:

```yaml
#
# Note: This is a sample ImageBasedInstallationConfig file showing
# which fields are available to aid you in creating your
# own image-based-installation-config.yaml file.
#
apiVersion: v1beta1
kind: ImageBasedInstallationConfig
metadata:
  name: example-image-based-installation-config
# The following fields are required
seedImage: quay.io/openshift-kni/seed-image:4.21.0
seedVersion: 4.21.0
installationDisk: /dev/vda
pullSecret: '<your_pull_secret>'
# networkConfig is optional and contains the network configuration for the host in NMState format.
# See https://nmstate.io/examples.html for examples.
# networkConfig:
#   interfaces:
#     - name: eth0
#       type: ethernet
#       state: up
#       mac-address: 00:00:00:00:00:00
#       ipv4:
#         enabled: true
#         address:
#           - ip: 192.168.122.2
#             prefix-length: 23
#         dhcp: false
```

3. Edit your installation configuration file:
Example image-based-installation-config.yaml file

```yaml
apiVersion: v1beta1
kind: ImageBasedInstallationConfig
metadata:
  name: example-image-based-installation-config
seedImage: quay.io/repo-id/seed:latest
seedVersion: "4.21.0"
extraPartitionStart: "-240G"
installationDisk: /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x62c...
sshKey: 'ssh-ed25519 AAAA...'
pullSecret: '{"auths": ...}'
networkConfig:
    interfaces:
      - name: ens1f0
        type: ethernet
        state: up
        ipv4:
          enabled: true
          dhcp: false
          auto-dns: false
          address:
            - ip: 192.168.200.25
              prefix-length: 24
        ipv6:
          enabled: false
    dns-resolver:
      config:
        server:
          - 192.168.15.47
          - 192.168.15.48
    routes:
      config:
      - destination: 0.0.0.0/0
        metric: 150
        next-hop-address: 192.168.200.254
        next-hop-interface: ens1f0
```

4. Create the live installation ISO by running the following command:

```terminal
$ openshift-install image-based create image --dir ibi-iso-workdir
```

Example output

```terminal
INFO Consuming Image-based Installation ISO Config from target directory
INFO Creating Image-based Installation ISO with embedded ignition
```


* View the output in the working directory:

```text
ibi-iso-workdir/
  └── rhcos-ibi.iso
```


* Reference specifications for the image-based-installation-config.yaml manifest

## Configuring additional partitions on the target host

The installation ISO creates a partition for the /var/lib/containers directory as part of the image-based installation process.

You can create additional partitions by using the coreosInstallerArgs specification. For example, in hard disks with adequate storage, you might need an additional partition for storage options, such as Logical Volume Manager (LVM) Storage.


[NOTE]
----
The /var/lib/containers partition requires at least 500 GB to ensure adequate disk space for precached images. You must create additional partitions with a starting position larger than the partition for /var/lib/containers.
----

1. Edit the image-based-installation-config.yaml file to configure additional partitions:
Example image-based-installation-config.yaml file

```yaml
apiVersion: v1beta1
kind: ImageBasedInstallationConfig
metadata:
  name: example-extra-partition
seedImage: quay.io/repo-id/seed:latest
seedVersion: "4.21.0"
installationDisk: /dev/sda
pullSecret: '{"auths": ...}'
# ...
skipDiskCleanup: true 1
coreosInstallerArgs:
   - "--save-partindex" 2
   - "6" 3
ignitionConfigOverride: |
  {
    "ignition": {
      "version": "3.2.0"
    },
    "storage": {
      "disks": [
        {
          "device": "/dev/sda", 4
          "partitions": [
            {
              "label": "storage", 5
              "number": 6, 6
              "sizeMiB": 380000, 7
              "startMiB": 500000 8
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
```

Specify true to skip disk formatting during the installation process.
Specify this argument to preserve a partition.
The live installation ISO requires five partitions. Specify a number greater than five to identify the additional partition to preserve.
Specify the installation disk on the target host.
Specify the label for the partition.
Specify the number for the partition.
Specify the size of parition in MiB.
Specify the starting position on the disk in MiB for the additional partition. You must specify a starting point larger that the partition for var/lib/containers.

* When you complete the preinstallation of the host with the live installation ISO, login to the target host and run the following command to view the partitions:

```terminal
$ lsblk
```

Example output

```terminal
sda    8:0    0  140G  0 disk
├─sda1 8:1    0    1M  0 part
├─sda2 8:2    0  127M  0 part
├─sda3 8:3    0  384M  0 part /var/mnt/boot
├─sda4 8:4    0  120G  0 part /var/mnt
├─sda5 8:5    0  500G  0 part /var/lib/containers
└─sda6 8:6    0  380G  0 part
```


# Provisioning the live installation ISO to a host

Using your preferred method, boot the target bare-metal host from the rhcos-ibi.iso live installation ISO to preinstall single-node OpenShift.

1. Login to the target host.
2. View the system logs by running the following command:

```terminal
$ journalctl -b
```

Example output

```terminal
