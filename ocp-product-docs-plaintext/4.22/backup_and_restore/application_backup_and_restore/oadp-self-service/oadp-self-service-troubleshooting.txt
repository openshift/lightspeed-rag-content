# OADP Self-Service troubleshooting


Resolve common errors and issues when using OADP Self-Service by following troubleshooting procedures for backup storage locations and backup operations. This helps you quickly identify and fix problems independently.

# Resolving error NonAdminBackupStorageLocation not found in the namespace

Resolve the NonAdminBackupStorageLocation not found in the namespace error by using a backup storage location that belongs to the same namespace as your backup. This helps ensure successful backup operations.

Consider the following scenario of a namespace admin backup:

* You have created two NonAdminBackupStorageLocations (NABLs) custom resources (CRs) in two different namespaces, for example, nabsl-1 in namespace-1 and nabsl-2 in namespace-2.
* You are taking a backup of namespace-1 and use nabsl-2 in the NonAdminBackup (NAB) CR.

In this scenario, after creating the NAB CR, you get the following error. The cause of the error is that the NABSL CR does not belong to the namespace that you are trying to back up.


```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: NonAdminBackup
...
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-02-20T10:13:00Z"
  message: 'NonAdminBackupStorageLocation not found in the namespace: NonAdminBackupStorageLocation.oadp.openshift.io
    "nabsl2" not found'
  reason: InvalidBackupSpec
  status: "False"
  type: Accepted
  phase: BackingOff
```


* Use the NABSL that belongs to the same namespace that you are trying to back up.

In this scenario, you must use nabsl-1 in the NAB CR to back up namespace-1.

# Resolving error NonAdminBackupStorageLocation cannot be set as default

Resolve the error that occurs when you set a NonAdminBackupStorageLocation (NABSL) custom resource (CR) as the default backup storage location. This helps you resolve validation errors and configure backup storage locations correctly.

As a non-admin user, if you have created a NABSL CR in your authorized namespace, you cannot set the NABSL CR as the default backup storage location.

If you set the NABSL CR as the default backup storage location, the NABSL CR fails to validate and the NonAdminController (NAC) gives an error message.


```text
NonAdminBackupStorageLocation cannot be used as a default BSL
```


* To successfully validate and reconcile the NABSL CR, set the default field to false in the NABSL CR:

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: NonAdminBackupStorageLocation
...
spec:
  backupStorageLocationSpec:
    credential:
      key: cloud
      name: cloud-credentials-gcp
    default: false
    objectStorage:
      bucket: oad..7l8
      prefix: velero
    provider: gcp
```


where:
default:: Specifies that the default backup storage location is set to false.
