# Configuring the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) with more than one Volume Snapshot Location


Configure multiple Volume Snapshot Locations (VSLs) in the Data Protection Application (DPA) to store volume snapshots across different cloud provider regions. This provides geographic redundancy and regional disaster recovery capabilities.

# Configuring the DPA with more than one VSL

Configure the DataProtectionApplication (DPA) custom resource (CR) with multiple Volume Snapshot Locations (VSLs) using provider-specific credentials in the same region as your persistent volumes. This provides volume snapshot distribution across different storage targets.

* Configure the DPA CR with more than one VSL as shown in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
#...
snapshotLocations:
  - velero:
      config:
        profile: default
        region: <region>
      credential:
        key: cloud
        name: cloud-credentials
      provider: aws
  - velero:
      config:
        profile: default
        region: <region>
      credential:
        key: cloud
        name: <custom_credential>
      provider: aws
#...
```


where:
<region>:: Specifies the region. The snapshot location must be in the same region as the persistent volumes.
<custom_credential>:: Specifies the custom credential name.
