# Disconnected environment support in OLM v1


To support cluster administrators that prioritize high security by running their clusters in internet-disconnected environments, especially for mission-critical production workloads, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) v1 includes cluster extension lifecycle management functionality that works within these disconnected environments, starting in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18.

# About disconnected support and the oc-mirror plugin in OLM v1

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) v1 supports disconnected environments starting in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18. After using the oc-mirror plugin for the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) to mirror the images required for your cluster to a mirror registry in your fully or partially disconnected environments, OLM v1 can function properly in these environments by utilizing either of the following sets of resources, depending on which oc-mirror plugin version you are using:

* ImageContentSourcePolicy resources, which are automatically generated by oc-mirror plugin v1, and ClusterCatalog resources, which must be manually created after using oc-mirror plugin v1
* ImageDigestMirrorSet, ImageTagMirrorSet, and ClusterCatalog resources, which are all automatically generated by oc-mirror plugin v2


[NOTE]
----
Starting in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18, oc-mirror plugin v2 is the recommended version for mirroring.

For more information and procedures, see the Disconnected environments guide for the oc-mirror plugin version you plan to use.
