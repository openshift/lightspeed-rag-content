# Supported extensions


To install an Operator as a cluster extension, it must meet bundle format, install mode, and dependency requirements. Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) v1 supports extensions that use webhooks for validation, mutation, or conversion.
Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) v1 supports extensions that use the AllNamespaces install mode. With this mode, the Operator watches and manages resources across all namespaces in the cluster.
As a Technology Preview feature, you can configure an extension to watch a specific namespace. This limits watching to one namespace instead of the entire cluster.

# Supported bundle formats and dependencies

To install an Operator as a cluster extension, the Operator must be packaged using the registry+v1 bundle format. OLM v1 does not support Operators that declare dependencies by using file-based catalog properties.

To install an Operator as a cluster extension, it must meet the following criteria:

* The Operator is packaged using the registry+v1 bundle format.
* The Operator does not declare dependencies by using the following file-based catalog properties:
* olm.gvk.required
* olm.package.required
* olm.constraint

OLM v1 verifies that an Operator meets these requirements during installation. If an Operator does not meet these criteria, OLM v1 reports the issue in the cluster extension status conditions.

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) v1 does not support the OperatorConditions API introduced in OLM (Classic).

If an extension relies on only the OperatorConditions API to manage updates, the extension might not install correctly. Most extensions that rely on this API fail at start time, but some might fail during reconciliation.

As a workaround, you can pin your extension to a specific version. When you want to update your extension, consult the extension&#8217;s documentation to find out when it is safe to pin the extension to a new version.

# Webhook support

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) v1 supports Operators that use webhooks for validation, mutation, or conversion. Operators use webhooks to enforce security policies or inject configurations into resources.

The OpenShift Service CA Operator automatically manages webhook certificates. When you install an Operator that includes webhooks, the OpenShift Service CA Operator completes the following actions:

* Applies Service CA annotations to webhook configurations and services.
* Generates TLS certificates in the namespace where you install the cluster extension.
* Mounts certificate secrets to the Operator deployment.
* Configures webhook services with proper TLS settings.

* Mutating admission webhooks (Kubernetes documentation)
* Conversion webhooks (Kubernetes documentation)
