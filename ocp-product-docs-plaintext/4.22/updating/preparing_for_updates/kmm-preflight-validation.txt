# Preflight validation for Kernel Module Management (KMM) Modules


Before performing an upgrade on the cluster with applied KMM modules, you must verify that kernel modules installed using KMM are able to be installed on the nodes after the cluster upgrade and possible kernel upgrade. Preflight attempts to validate every Module loaded in the cluster, in parallel. Preflight does not wait for validation of one Module to complete before starting validation of another Module.

# Validation kickoff

Preflight validation is triggered by creating a PreflightValidationOCP resource in the cluster. This resource contains the following fields:

dtkImage:: The DTK container image released for the specific Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version of the cluster. If this value is not set, the DTK_AUTO feature cannot be used.

You can obtain the image by running one of the following commands in the cluster:

```terminal
# For x86_64 image:
$ oc adm release info quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:4.21.0-x86_64 --image-for=driver-toolkit
```


```terminal
# For ARM64 image:
$ oc adm release info quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:4.21.0-aarch64 --image-for=driver-toolkit
```

kernelVersion:: Required field that provides the version of the kernel that the cluster is upgraded to.

You can obtain the version by running the following command in the cluster:

```terminal
$ podman run -it --rm $(oc adm release info quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:4.21.0-x86_64 --image-for=driver-toolkit) cat /etc/driver-toolkit-release.json
```

pushBuiltImage:: If true, then the images created during the Build and Sign validation are pushed to their repositories. This field is false by default.

# Validation lifecycle

Preflight validation attempts to validate every module loaded in the cluster. Preflight stops running validation on a Module resource after the validation is successful. If module validation fails, you can change the module definitions and Preflight tries to validate the module again in the next loop.

If you want to run Preflight validation for an additional kernel, then you should create another PreflightValidationOCP resource for that kernel. After all the modules have been validated, it is recommended to delete the PreflightValidationOCP resource.

# Validation status

A PreflightValidationOCP resource reports the status and progress of each module in the cluster that it attempts or has attempted to validate in its .status.modules list. Elements of that list contain the following fields:

name:: The name of the Module resource.
namespace:: The namespace of the Module resource.
statusReason:: Verbal explanation regarding the status.
verificationStage:: Describes the validation stage being executed:
* Image: Image existence verification
* Done: Verification is done
verificationStatus:: The status of the Module verification:
* Success: Verified
* Failure: Verification failed
* InProgress: Verification is in progress

# Image validation stage

Image validation is always the first stage of the preflight validation to be executed. If image validation is successful, no other validations are run on that specific module. The Operator uses the container runtime to check the image existence and accessibility for the updaded kernel in the module.

If the image validation fails and there is a build/sign section in the module that is relevant to the upgraded kernel, the controller tries to build or sign the image. If the PushBuiltImage flag is defined in the PreflightValidationOCP resource, the controller will also try to push the resulting image into its repository. The resulting image name is taken from the definition of the containerImage field of the Module CR.


[NOTE]
----
In case a build section exists, the input image in the sign section is used as the output image by the build section. Therefore, in order for the input image to be available to the sign section, the PushBuiltImage flag must be defined in the PreflightValidationOCP CR.

# Example PreflightValidationOCP resource

The following example shows a PreflightValidationOCP resource in the YAML format.

The example verifies all of the currently present modules against the upcoming 5.14.0-570.19.1.el9_6.x86_64 kernel. Because .spec.pushBuiltImage is set to true, KMM pushes the resulting images of Build/Sign into the defined repositories.


```yaml
apiVersion: kmm.sigs.x-k8s.io/v1beta2
kind: PreflightValidationOCP
metadata:
  name: preflight
spec:
  kernelVersion: 5.14.0-570.19.1.el9_6.x86_64
  dtkImage: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-art-dev@sha256:fe0322730440f1cbe6fffaaa8cac131b56574bec8abe3ec5b462e17557fecb32
  pushBuiltImage: true
```
