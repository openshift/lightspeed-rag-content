# About live migration


Live migration is the process of moving a running virtual machine (VM) to another node in the cluster without interrupting the virtual workload. Live migration enables smooth transitions during cluster upgrades or any time a node needs to be drained for maintenance or configuration changes.
By default, live migration traffic is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS).

# Live migration requirements

Live migration has the following requirements:

* The cluster must have shared storage with ReadWriteMany (RWX) access mode.
* The cluster must have sufficient RAM and network bandwidth.

[NOTE]
----
You must ensure that there is enough memory request capacity in the cluster to support node drains that result in live migrations. You can determine the approximate required spare memory by using the following calculation:

```
Product of (Maximum number of nodes that can drain in parallel) and (Highest total VM memory request allocations across nodes)
```

The default number of migrations that can run in parallel in the cluster is 5.
----
* If a VM uses a host model CPU, the nodes must support the CPU.
* Configuring a dedicated Multus network for live migration is highly recommended. A dedicated network minimizes the effects of network saturation on tenant workloads during migration.

# About live migration permissions

In OpenShift Virtualization 4.19 and later, live migration operations are restricted to users who are explicitly granted the kubevirt.io:migrate cluster role. Users with this role can create, delete, and update virtual machine (VM) live migration requests.

The live migration requests are represented by VirtualMachineInstanceMigration (VMIM) custom resources. Cluster administrators can bind the kubevirt.io:migrate role to trusted users or groups at either the namespace or cluster level.

Before OpenShift Virtualization 4.19, namespace administrators had live migration permissions by default. This behavior changed in version 4.19 to prevent unintended or malicious disruptions to infrastructure-critical migration operations.

As a cluster administrator, you can preserve the old behavior by creating a temporary cluster role before updating. After assigning the new role to users, delete the temporary role to enforce the more restrictive permissions. If you have already updated, you can still revert to the old behavior by aggregating the kubevirt.io:migrate role into the admin cluster role.

# Preserving pre-4.19 live migration permissions during update

Before you update to OpenShift Virtualization 4.21, you can create a temporary cluster role to preserve the previous live migration permissions until you are ready for the more restrictive default permissions to take effect.

* The OpenShift CLI (`oc`) is installed.
* You have cluster administrator permissions.

1. Before updating to OpenShift Virtualization 4.21, create a temporary ClusterRole object. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  labels:
    rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-admin=true 1
  name: kubevirt.io:upgrademigrate
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - subresources.kubevirt.io
  resources:
  - virtualmachines/migrate
  verbs:
  - update
- apiGroups:
  - kubevirt.io
  resources:
  - virtualmachineinstancemigrations
  verbs:
  - get
  - delete
  - create
  - update
  - patch
  - list
  - watch
  - deletecollection
```

This cluster role is aggregated into the admin role before you update OpenShift Virtualization. The update process does not modify it, ensuring the previous behavior is maintained.
2. Add the cluster role manifest to the cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <cluster_role_file_name>.yaml
```

3. Update OpenShift Virtualization to version 4.21.
4. Bind the kubevirt.io:migrate cluster role to trusted users or groups by running one of the following commands, replacing <namespace>, <first_user>, <second_user>, and <group_name> with your own values.
* To bind the role at the namespace level, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -n <namespace> rolebinding kvmigrate --clusterrole=kubevirt.io:migrate --user=<first_user> --user=<second_user> --group=<group_name>
```

* To bind the role at the cluster level, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create clusterrolebinding kvmigrate --clusterrole=kubevirt.io:migrate --user=<first_user> --user=<second_user> --group=<group_name>
```

5. When you have bound the kubevirt.io:migrate role to all necessary users, delete the temporary ClusterRole object by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete clusterrole kubevirt.io:upgrademigrate
```


After you delete the temporary cluster role, only users with the kubevirt.io:migrate role can create, delete, and update live migration requests.

# Granting live migration permissions

You can grant trusted users or groups the ability to create, delete, and update live migration instances.

* The OpenShift CLI (`oc`) is installed.
* You have cluster administrator permissions.

* (Optional) To change the default behavior so that namespace administrators always have permission to create, delete, and update live migrations, aggregate the kubevirt.io:migrate role into the admin cluster role by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc label --overwrite clusterrole kubevirt.io:migrate rbac.authorization.k8s.io/aggregate-to-admin=true
```

* Bind the kubevirt.io:migrate cluster role to trusted users or groups by running one of the following commands, replacing <namespace>, <first_user>, <second_user>, and <group_name> with your own values.
* To bind the role at the namespace level, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -n <namespace> rolebinding kvmigrate --clusterrole=kubevirt.io:migrate --user=<first_user> --user=<second_user> --group=<group_name>
```

* To bind the role at the cluster level, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create clusterrolebinding kvmigrate --clusterrole=kubevirt.io:migrate --user=<first_user> --user=<second_user> --group=<group_name>
```


# VM migration tuning

You can adjust your cluster-wide live migration settings based on the type of workload and migration scenario.

This enables you to control how many VMs migrate at the same time, the network bandwidth you want to use for each migration, and how long OpenShift Virtualization attempts to complete the migration before canceling the process. Configure these settings in the HyperConverged custom resource (CR).

If you are migrating multiple VMs per node at the same time, set a bandwidthPerMigration limit to prevent a large or busy VM from using a large portion of the node’s network bandwidth. By default, the bandwidthPerMigration value is 0, which means unlimited.

A large VM running a heavy workload (for example, database processing), with higher memory dirty rates, requires a higher bandwidth to complete the migration.


[NOTE]
----
Post copy mode, when enabled, triggers if the initial pre-copy phase does not complete within the defined timeout. During post copy, the VM CPUs pause on the source host while transferring the minimum required memory pages. Then the VM CPUs activate on the destination host, and the remaining memory pages transfer into the destination node at runtime. This can impact performance during the transfer.
Post copy mode should not be used for critical data, or with unstable networks.

# Common live migration tasks

You can perform the following live migration tasks:

* Configure live migration settings
* Configure live migration for heavy workloads
* Initiate and cancel live migration
* Monitor the progress of all live migrations in the Migrations tab of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.
* View VM migration metrics in the Metrics tab of the web console.
