# Exposing downward metrics for virtual machines


As an administrator, you can expose a limited set of host and virtual machine (VM) metrics to a guest VM by first enabling a downwardMetrics feature gate and then configuring a downwardMetrics device.
Users can view the metrics results by using the command line or the vm-dump-metrics tool.

[NOTE]
----
On Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9, use the command line to view downward metrics. See Viewing downward metrics by using the command line.
The vm-dump-metrics tool is not supported on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9 platform.

# Enabling or disabling the downwardMetrics feature gate

You can enable or disable the downwardMetrics feature gate by performing either of the following actions:

* Editing the HyperConverged custom resource (CR) in your default editor
* Using the command line

## Enabling or disabling the downward metrics feature gate in a YAML file

To expose downward metrics for a host virtual machine, you can enable the downwardMetrics feature gate by editing a YAML file.

* You must have administrator privileges to enable the feature gate.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

1. Open the HyperConverged custom resource (CR) in your default editor by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc edit hyperconverged kubevirt-hyperconverged -n openshift-cnv
```

2. Choose to enable or disable the downwardMetrics feature gate as follows:
* To enable the downwardMetrics feature gate, add and then set spec.featureGates.downwardMetrics to true. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: hco.kubevirt.io/v1beta1
kind: HyperConverged
metadata:
  name: kubevirt-hyperconverged
  namespace: openshift-cnv
spec:
    featureGates:
      downwardMetrics: true
# ...
```

* To disable the downwardMetrics feature gate, set spec.featureGates.downwardMetrics to false. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: hco.kubevirt.io/v1beta1
kind: HyperConverged
metadata:
  name: kubevirt-hyperconverged
  namespace: openshift-cnv
spec:
    featureGates:
      downwardMetrics: false
# ...
```


## Enabling or disabling the downward metrics feature gate from the CLI

To expose downward metrics for a host virtual machine, you can enable the downwardMetrics feature gate by using the command line.

* You must have administrator privileges to enable the feature gate.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* Choose to enable or disable the downwardMetrics feature gate as follows:
* Enable the downwardMetrics feature gate by running the command shown in the following example:

```terminal
$ oc patch hco kubevirt-hyperconverged -n openshift-cnv \
  --type json -p '[{"op": "replace", "path": \
  "/spec/featureGates/downwardMetrics", \
  "value": true}]'
```

* Disable the downwardMetrics feature gate by running the command shown in the following example:

```terminal
$ oc patch hco kubevirt-hyperconverged -n openshift-cnv \
  --type json -p '[{"op": "replace", "path": \
  "/spec/featureGates/downwardMetrics", \
  "value": false}]'
```


# Configuring a downward metrics device

You can enable the capturing of downward metrics for a host VM by creating a configuration file that includes a downwardMetrics device. Adding this device establishes that the metrics are exposed through a virtio-serial port.

* You must first enable the downwardMetrics feature gate.

* Edit or create a YAML file that includes a downwardMetrics device, as shown in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  name: fedora
  namespace: default
spec:
  dataVolumeTemplates:
    - metadata:
        name: fedora-volume
      spec:
        sourceRef:
          kind: DataSource
          name: fedora
          namespace: openshift-virtualization-os-images
        storage:
          resources: {}
  instancetype:
    name: u1.medium
  runStrategy: Always
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app.kubernetes.io/name: headless
    spec:
      domain:
        devices:
          downwardMetrics: {} 1
      subdomain: headless
      volumes:
        - dataVolume:
            name: fedora-volume
          name: rootdisk
        - cloudInitNoCloud:
            userData: |
              #cloud-config
              chpasswd:
                expire: false
              password: '<password>' 2
              user: fedora
          name: cloudinitdisk
```

The downwardMetrics device.
The password for the fedora user.

# Viewing downward metrics

You can view downward metrics by using either the command-line interface (CLI), or the vm-dump-metrics tool.


[NOTE]
----
On Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9, use the command line to view downward metrics. The vm-dump-metrics tool is not supported on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9 platform.
----

## Viewing downward metrics by using the CLI

You can view downward metrics by entering a command from inside a guest virtual machine (VM).

* Run the following commands:

```terminal
$ sudo sh -c 'printf "GET /metrics/XML\n\n" > /dev/virtio-ports/org.github.vhostmd.1'
```


```terminal
$ sudo cat /dev/virtio-ports/org.github.vhostmd.1
```


## Viewing downward metrics by using the vm-dump-metrics tool

To view downward metrics, install the vm-dump-metrics tool and then use the tool to expose the metrics results.


[NOTE]
----
On Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9, use the command line to view downward metrics. The vm-dump-metrics tool is not supported on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9 platform.
----

1. Install the vm-dump-metrics tool by running the following command:

```terminal
$ sudo dnf install -y vm-dump-metrics
```

2. Retrieve the metrics results by running the following command:

```terminal
$ sudo vm-dump-metrics
```


Example output:

```xml
<metrics>
  <metric type="string" context="host">
    <name>HostName</name>
    <value>node01</value>
[...]
  <metric type="int64" context="host" unit="s">
    <name>Time</name>
    <value>1619008605</value>
  </metric>
  <metric type="string" context="host">
    <name>VirtualizationVendor</name>
    <value>kubevirt.io</value>
  </metric>
</metrics>
```
