# File Integrity Operator overview

The File Integrity Operator continually runs file integrity checks on the cluster nodes. It deploys a DaemonSet that initializes and runs privileged Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) containers on each node, providing a log of files that have been modified since the initial run of the DaemonSet pods.
