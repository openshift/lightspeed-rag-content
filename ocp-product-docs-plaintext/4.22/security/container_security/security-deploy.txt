# Deploying containers


You can use a variety of techniques to make sure that the containers you
deploy hold the latest production-quality content and that they have not
been tampered with. These techniques include setting up build triggers to
incorporate the latest code and using signatures to ensure that the container
comes from a trusted source and has not been modified.

# Controlling container deployments with triggers

If something happens during the build process, or if a vulnerability is
discovered after an image has been deployed, you can use tooling for automated,
policy-based deployment to remediate. You can use triggers to rebuild and replace images,
ensuring the immutable containers process,
instead of patching running containers, which is not recommended.

![Secure Deployments]

For example, you build an application using three container image layers: core,
middleware, and applications. An issue is discovered in the core image and that
image is rebuilt. After the build is complete, the image is pushed to your
OpenShift Container Registry. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform detects that the image has changed
and automatically rebuilds and deploys the application image, based on the
defined triggers. This change incorporates the fixed libraries and ensures that
the production code is identical to the most current image.

You can use the oc set triggers command to set a deployment trigger.
For example, to set a trigger for a deployment called
deployment-example:


```terminal
$ oc set triggers deploy/deployment-example \
    --from-image=example:latest \
    --containers=web
```


# Controlling what image sources can be deployed

It is important that the intended images are actually being deployed, that the
images including the contained content
are from trusted sources, and they have not been altered. Cryptographic signing
provides this assurance. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform enables cluster administrators to apply
security policy that is broad or narrow, reflecting deployment environment and
security requirements. Two parameters define this policy:

* one or more registries, with optional project namespace
* trust type, such as accept, reject, or require public key(s)

You can use these policy parameters to allow, deny, or require a trust
relationship for entire registries, parts of registries, or individual
images. Using trusted public keys, you can ensure that the source is
cryptographically verified.
The policy rules apply to nodes. Policy may be
applied uniformly across all nodes or targeted for different node workloads (for
example, build, zone, or environment).


```json
{
    "default": [{"type": "reject"}],
    "transports": {
        "docker": {
            "access.redhat.com": [
                {
                    "type": "signedBy",
                    "keyType": "GPGKeys",
                    "keyPath": "/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release"
                }
            ]
        },
        "atomic": {
            "172.30.1.1:5000/openshift": [
                {
                    "type": "signedBy",
                    "keyType": "GPGKeys",
                    "keyPath": "/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release"
                }
            ],
            "172.30.1.1:5000/production": [
                {
                    "type": "signedBy",
                    "keyType": "GPGKeys",
                    "keyPath": "/etc/pki/example.com/pubkey"
                }
            ],
            "172.30.1.1:5000": [{"type": "reject"}]
        }
    }
}
```


The policy can be saved onto a node as /etc/containers/policy.json.
Saving this file to a node is best accomplished using a new
MachineConfig object. This
example enforces the following rules:

* Require images from the Red Hat Registry (registry.access.redhat.com) to be
signed by the Red Hat public key.
* Require images from your OpenShift Container Registry in the openshift
namespace to be signed by the Red Hat public key.
* Require images from your OpenShift Container Registry in the production
namespace to be signed by the public key for example.com.
* Reject all other registries not specified by the global default definition.

# Using signature transports

A signature transport is a way to store and retrieve the binary signature blob.
There are two types of signature transports.

* atomic: Managed by the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform API.
* docker: Served as a local file or by a web server.

The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform API manages signatures that use the atomic transport type.
You must store the images that use this signature type in
your OpenShift Container Registry. Because the docker/distribution extensions API
auto-discovers the image signature endpoint, no additional
configuration is required.

Signatures that use the docker transport type are served by local file or web
server. These signatures are more flexible; you can serve images from any
container image registry and use an independent server to deliver binary
signatures.

However, the docker transport type requires additional configuration. You must
configure the nodes with the URI of the signature server by placing
arbitrarily-named YAML files into a directory on the host system,
/etc/containers/registries.d by default. The YAML configuration files contain a
registry URI and a signature server URI, or sigstore:


```yaml
docker:
    access.redhat.com:
        sigstore: https://access.redhat.com/webassets/docker/content/sigstore
```


In this example, the Red Hat Registry, access.redhat.com, is the signature
server that provides signatures for the docker transport type. Its URI is
defined in the sigstore parameter. You might name this file
/etc/containers/registries.d/redhat.com.yaml and use the Machine Config
Operator to
automatically place the file on each node in your cluster. No service
restart is required since policy and registries.d files are dynamically
loaded by the container runtime.

# Creating secrets and config maps

The Secret object type provides a mechanism to hold sensitive information such
as passwords, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform client configuration files, dockercfg files,
and private source repository credentials. Secrets decouple sensitive content
from pods. You can mount secrets into containers using a volume plugin or the
system can use secrets to perform actions on behalf of a pod.

For example, to add a secret to your deployment configuration
so that it can access a private image repository, do the following:

1. Log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.
2. Create a new project.
3. Navigate to Resources -> Secrets and create a new secret. Set Secret Type to
Image Secret and Authentication Type to Image Registry Credentials to
enter credentials for accessing a private image repository.
4. When creating a deployment configuration (for example, from the Add to Project ->
Deploy Image page), set the Pull Secret to your new secret.

Config maps are similar to secrets, but are designed to support working with
strings that do not contain sensitive information. The ConfigMap object holds
key-value pairs of configuration data that can be consumed in pods or used to
store configuration data for system components such as controllers.

# Automating continuous deployment

You can integrate your own continuous deployment (CD) tooling with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

By leveraging CI/CD and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, you can automate the process of rebuilding the application to incorporate the latest fixes, testing, and ensuring that it is deployed everywhere within the environment.
