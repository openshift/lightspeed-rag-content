# External Secrets Operator for Red Hat OpenShift APIs


External Secrets Operator for Red Hat OpenShift uses the following two APIs to configure the external-secrets application deployment.

The following list contains the External Secrets Operator for Red Hat OpenShift APIs:
* ExternalSecretsConfig
* ExternalSecretsManager

# externalSecretsManagerList

The externalSecretsManagerList object fetches the list of externalSecretsManager objects.



# externalSecretsManager

The externalSecretsManager object defines the configuration and information of deployments managed by the External Secrets Operator. Set the name to cluster as this allows only one instance of externalSecretsManager per cluster.

You can configure global options by using externalSecretsManager. This serves as a centralized configuration for managing multiple controllers of the Operator. The Operator automatically creates the externalSecretsManager object during installation.



# externalSecretsConfigList

The externalSecretsConfigList object fetches the list of externalSecretsConfig objects.



# externalSecretsConfig

The externalSecretsConfig object defines the configuration and information for the managed external-secrets operand deployment. Set the name to cluster as externalSecretsConfig object allows only one instance per cluster.

Creating an externalSecretsConfig object triggers the deployment of the external-secrets operand and maintains the desired state.
