# Impersonating the system:admin user



# API impersonation

You can configure a request to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform API to act as though it originated from another user. For more information, see User impersonation in the Kubernetes documentation.

# Impersonating the system:admin user

You can use the OpenShift web console to impersonate a user and select multiple group memberships at the same time to reproduce that user’s effective permissions.

* To grant a user permission to impersonate system:admin, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create clusterrolebinding <any_valid_name> --clusterrole=sudoer --user=<username>
```


[TIP]
----
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to grant permission to impersonate system:admin:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: <any_valid_name>
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: sudoer
subjects:
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: User
  name: <username>
```

----

# Impersonating the system:admin group

When a system:admin user is granted cluster administration permissions through a group, you must include the
--as=<user> --as-group=<group1> --as-group=<group2> parameters in the command to impersonate the associated groups.

* To grant a user permission to impersonate a system:admin by impersonating the associated cluster administration groups,
run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create clusterrolebinding <any_valid_name> --clusterrole=sudoer --as=<user> \
--as-group=<group1> --as-group=<group2>
```


# Impersonating a user with multiple group memberships in the web console

You can start user impersonation from multiple locations in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Console. Depending on where you start, you can impersonate a single user, a single group, or a user with one or more group memberships.

* You must be logged in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console as a user with permission to impersonate other users.
* The user or group that you want to impersonate must already exist.


[NOTE]
----
The impersonated user can belong to zero or more groups.
----

1. From the Overview page in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform console, click your user name and select Impersonate User.
2. In the Username field in the Impersonate dialog, enter the name of the user you want to impersonate.
3. Optional: In the Groups field, choose one or more groups that are associated with the user.

The dialog displays a warning message explaining that impersonation applies the effective permissions of the specified user and any selected groups.
4. Click Impersonate to impersonate your selected user, groups, or both.


[NOTE]
----
Selecting one group uses the existing single-group impersonation behavior. Selecting no groups uses regular single-user impersonation.
----

# Starting impersonation from the Users or Groups pages

You can start impersonation for users or groups from the Users or Groups pages in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Console.

1. From the Overview page in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform console, click User Management → Users.
2. Open the menu for the user you want to impersonate and select Impersonate User.
3. Optional: To impersonate a group, click User Management → Groups, click the menu for that group, and select Impersonate Group.

# Stopping impersonation

You can stop impersonating a user or group at any time from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Console.

1. On any page in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform console, click Stop impersonating at the top of the page.
2. Alternatively, click your user name and select Stop impersonating.

# Adding unauthenticated groups to cluster roles

As a cluster administrator, you can add unauthenticated users to the following cluster roles in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform by creating a cluster role binding. Unauthenticated users do not have access to non-public cluster roles. This should only be done in specific use cases when necessary.

You can add unauthenticated users to the following cluster roles:

* system:scope-impersonation
* system:webhook
* system:oauth-token-deleter
* self-access-reviewer


[IMPORTANT]
----
Always verify compliance with your organization's security standards when modifying unauthenticated access.
----

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Create a YAML file named add-<cluster_role>-unauth.yaml and add the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
 annotations:
   rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate: "true"
 name: <cluster_role>access-unauthenticated
roleRef:
 apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
 kind: ClusterRole
 name: <cluster_role>
subjects:
 - apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
   kind: Group
   name: system:unauthenticated
```

2. Apply the configuration by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f add-<cluster_role>.yaml
```
