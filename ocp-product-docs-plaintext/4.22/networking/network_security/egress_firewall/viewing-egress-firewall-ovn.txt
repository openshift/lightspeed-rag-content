# Viewing an egress firewall for a project


As a cluster administrator, you can list the names of any existing egress firewalls and view the traffic rules for a specific egress firewall.

# Viewing an EgressFirewall custom resource (CR)

You can view an EgressFirewall CR in your cluster.

* A cluster using the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin.
* Install the OpenShift Command-line Interface (CLI), commonly known as oc.
* You must log in to the cluster.

1. Optional: To view the names of the EgressFirewall CR defined in your cluster,
enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get egressfirewall --all-namespaces
```

2. To inspect a policy, enter the following command. Replace <policy_name> with the name of the policy to inspect.

```terminal
$ oc describe egressfirewall <policy_name>
```
