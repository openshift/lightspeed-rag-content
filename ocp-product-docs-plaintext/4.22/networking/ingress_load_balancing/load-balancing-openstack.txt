# Load balancing on OpenStack


To distribute network traffic and communications activity evenly across your compute instances in OpenStack, configure load balancing services.

# Limitations of load balancer services

To optimise network resource management and mitigate operational risks in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters on OpenStack, review the implementation of Octavia for load balancer services.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters on OpenStack use Octavia to handle load balancer services. As a result, your cluster has several functional limitations.

OpenStack Octavia has two supported providers: Amphora and OVN. These providers differ in available features and implementation details. These distinctions affect load balancer services that you create on your cluster.

## Local external traffic policies

You can set the external traffic policy (ETP) parameter, .spec.externalTrafficPolicy, on a load balancer service to preserve the source IP address of incoming traffic when it reaches service endpoint pods.

If your cluster uses the Amphora Octavia provider, the source IP of the traffic is replaced with the IP address of the Amphora VM. This behavior does not occur if your cluster uses the OVN Octavia provider.

Having the ETP option set to Local requires creating health monitors for the load balancer. Without health monitors, traffic can be routed to a node that does not have a functional endpoint, which causes the connection to drop. To force Cloud Provider OpenStack to create health monitors, you must set the value of the create-monitor option in the cloud provider configuration to true.

In OpenStack 16.2, the OVN Octavia provider does not support health monitors. Therefore, setting the ETP to Local is unsupported.

In OpenStack 16.2, the Amphora Octavia provider does not support HTTP monitors on UDP pools. As a result, UDP load balancer services have UDP-CONNECT monitors created instead. Due to implementation details, this configuration only functions properly with the OVN-Kubernetes CNI plugin.

# Scaling clusters for application traffic by using Octavia

To distribute traffic across multiple virtual machines (VMs), configure your cluster that runs on OpenStack to use the Octavia load balancing service. By using this feature, you can mitigate the bottleneck that single machines or addresses create.

You must create your own Octavia load balancer to use it for application network scaling.

## Scaling clusters by using Octavia

To ensure high availability and distribute traffic across multiple cluster API access points in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on OpenStack, create an Octavia load balancer. Configuring your cluster to use multiple balancers prevents network bottlenecks and ensures continuous access to your API services.

* Octavia is available on your OpenStack deployment.

1. From the command-line interface (CLI), create an Octavia load balancer that uses the Amphora driver:

```terminal
$ openstack loadbalancer create --name API_OCP_CLUSTER --vip-subnet-id <id_of_worker_vms_subnet>
```


You can use a name of your choice instead of API_OCP_CLUSTER.
2. After the load balancer becomes active, create listeners:

```terminal
$ openstack loadbalancer listener create --name API_OCP_CLUSTER_6443 --protocol HTTPS--protocol-port 6443 API_OCP_CLUSTER
```


[NOTE]
----
To view the status of the load balancer, enter openstack loadbalancer list.
----
3. Create a pool that uses the round-robin algorithm and has session persistence enabled:

```terminal
$ openstack loadbalancer pool create --name API_OCP_CLUSTER_pool_6443 --lb-algorithm ROUND_ROBIN --session-persistence type=<source_IP_address> --listener API_OCP_CLUSTER_6443 --protocol HTTPS
```

4. To ensure that control-plane machines are available, create a health monitor:

```terminal
$ openstack loadbalancer healthmonitor create --delay 5 --max-retries 4 --timeout 10 --type TCP API_OCP_CLUSTER_pool_6443
```

5. Add the control plane machines as members of the load balancer pool:

```terminal
$ for SERVER in $(MASTER-0-IP MASTER-1-IP MASTER-2-IP)
do
  openstack loadbalancer member create --address $SERVER  --protocol-port 6443 API_OCP_CLUSTER_pool_6443
done
```

6. Optional: To reuse the cluster API floating IP address, unset it:

```terminal
$ openstack floating ip unset $API_FIP
```

7. Add either the unset API_FIP or a new address to the created load balancer VIP:

```terminal
$ openstack floating ip set  --port $(openstack loadbalancer show -c <vip_port_id> -f value API_OCP_CLUSTER) $API_FIP
```


Your cluster now uses Octavia for load balancing.

# Services for a user-managed load balancer

To integrate your infrastructure with existing network standards or gain more control over traffic management in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
on OpenStack
, configure services for a user-managed load balancer.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Configuring a user-managed load balancer depends on your vendor's load balancer.
The information and examples in this section are for guideline purposes only. Consult the vendor documentation for more specific information about the vendor's load balancer.
----

Red Hat supports the following services for a user-managed load balancer:

* Ingress Controller
* OpenShift API
* OpenShift MachineConfig API

You can choose whether you want to configure one or all of these services for a user-managed load balancer. Configuring only the Ingress Controller service is a common configuration option. To better understand each service, view the following diagrams:

![An image that shows an example network workflow of an Ingress Controller operating in an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform environment.]

![An image that shows an example network workflow of an OpenShift API operating in an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform environment.]

![An image that shows an example network workflow of an OpenShift MachineConfig API operating in an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform environment.]

The following configuration options are supported for user-managed load balancers:

* Use a node selector to map the Ingress Controller to a specific set of nodes. You must assign a static IP address to each node in this set, or configure each node to receive the same IP address from the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). Infrastructure nodes commonly receive this type of configuration.
* Target all IP addresses on a subnet. This configuration can reduce maintenance overhead, because you can create and destroy nodes within those networks without reconfiguring the load balancer targets. If you deploy your ingress pods by using a machine set on a smaller network, such as a /27 or /28, you can simplify your load balancer targets.

[TIP]
----
You can list all IP addresses that exist in a network by checking the machine config pool's resources.
----

Before you configure a user-managed load balancer for your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, consider the following information:

* For a front-end IP address, you can use the same IP address for the front-end IP address, the Ingress Controller's load balancer, and API load balancer. Check the vendor's documentation for this capability.
* For a back-end IP address, ensure that an IP address for an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform control plane node does not change during the lifetime of the user-managed load balancer. You can achieve this by completing one of the following actions:
* Assign a static IP address to each control plane node.
* Configure each node to receive the same IP address from the DHCP every time the node requests a DHCP lease. Depending on the vendor, the DHCP lease might be in the form of an IP reservation or a static DHCP assignment.
* Manually define each node that runs the Ingress Controller in the user-managed load balancer for the Ingress Controller back-end service. For example, if the Ingress Controller moves to an undefined node, a connection outage can occur.

## Configuring a user-managed load balancer

To integrate your infrastructure with existing network standards or gain more control over traffic management in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
on OpenStack
, use a user-managed load balancer in place of the default load balancer.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Before you configure a user-managed load balancer, ensure that you read the "Services for a user-managed load balancer" section.
----

Read the following prerequisites that apply to the service that you want to configure for your user-managed load balancer.


[NOTE]
----
MetalLB, which runs on a cluster, functions as a user-managed load balancer.
----

The following list details OpenShift API prerequisites:

* You defined a front-end IP address.
* TCP ports 6443 and 22623 are exposed on the front-end IP address of your load balancer. Check the following items:
* Port 6443 provides access to the OpenShift API service.
* Port 22623 can provide ignition startup configurations to nodes.
* The front-end IP address and port 6443 are reachable by all users of your system with a location external to your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* The front-end IP address and port 22623 are reachable only by Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform nodes.
* The load balancer backend can communicate with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform control plane nodes on port 6443 and 22623.

The following list details Ingress Controller prerequisites:

* You defined a front-end IP address.
* TCP port 443 and port 80 are exposed on the front-end IP address of your load balancer.
* The front-end IP address, port 80 and port 443 are reachable by all users of your system with a location external to your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* The front-end IP address, port 80 and port 443 are reachable by all nodes that operate in your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* The load balancer backend can communicate with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform nodes that run the Ingress Controller on ports 80, 443, and 1936.

The following list details prerequisites for health check URL specifications:

You can configure most load balancers by setting health check URLs that determine if a service is available or unavailable. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform provides these health checks for the OpenShift API, Machine Configuration API, and Ingress Controller backend services.

The following example shows a Kubernetes API health check specification for a backend service:


```terminal
Path: HTTPS:6443/readyz
Healthy threshold: 2
Unhealthy threshold: 2
Timeout: 10
Interval: 10
```


The following example shows a Machine Config API health check specification for a backend service:


```terminal
Path: HTTPS:22623/healthz
Healthy threshold: 2
Unhealthy threshold: 2
Timeout: 10
Interval: 10
```


The following example shows a Ingress Controller health check specification for a backend service:


```terminal
Path: HTTP:1936/healthz/ready
Healthy threshold: 2
Unhealthy threshold: 2
Timeout: 5
Interval: 10
```


1. Configure the HAProxy Ingress Controller, so that you can enable access to the cluster from your load balancer on ports 6443, 22623, 443, and 80. Depending on your needs, you can specify the IP address of a single subnet or IP addresses from multiple subnets in your HAProxy configuration.
Example HAProxy configuration with one listed subnet

  "goVersion": "go1.10.3",
  "compiler": "gc",
  "platform": "linux/amd64"
}
```

2. Verify that the cluster machine configuration API is accessible to the Machine config server resource, by running the following command and observing the output:

```terminal
$ curl -v https://<loadbalancer_ip_address>:22623/healthz --insecure
```


If the configuration is correct, the output from the command shows the following response:

```terminal
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 0
```

3. Verify that the controller is accessible to the Ingress Controller resource on port 80, by running the following command and observing the output:

```terminal
$ curl -I -L -H "Host: console-openshift-console.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>" http://<load_balancer_front_end_IP_address>
```


If the configuration is correct, the output from the command shows the following response:

```terminal
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
content-length: 0
location: https://console-openshift-console.apps.ocp4.private.opequon.net/

```

3. Configure the DNS records for your cluster to target the front-end IP addresses of the user-managed load balancer. You must update records to your DNS server for the cluster API and applications over the load balancer. The following examples shows modified DNS records:

```dns
<load_balancer_ip_address>  A  api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
A record pointing to Load Balancer Front End
```


```dns
<load_balancer_ip_address>   A apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
A record pointing to Load Balancer Front End
```


[IMPORTANT]
----
DNS propagation might take some time for each DNS record to become available. Ensure that each DNS record propagates before validating each record.
----
4. For your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster to use the user-managed load balancer, you must specify the following configuration in your cluster's install-config.yaml file:

```yaml
# ...
platform:
  openstack:
    loadBalancer:
      type: UserManaged
    apiVIPs:
    - <api_ip> 2
    ingressVIPs:
    - <ingress_ip> 3
# ...
```


where:
loadBalancer.type:: Set UserManaged for the type parameter to specify a user-managed load balancer for your cluster. The parameter defaults to OpenShiftManagedDefault, which denotes the default internal load balancer. For services defined in an openshift-kni-infra namespace, a user-managed load balancer can deploy the coredns service to pods in your cluster but ignores keepalived and haproxy services.
loadBalancer.<api_ip>:: Specifies a user-managed load balancer. Specify the user-managed load balancer's public IP address, so that the Kubernetes API can communicate with the user-managed load balancer. Mandatory parameter.
loadBalancer.<ingress_ip>:: Specifies a user-managed load balancer. Specify the user-managed load balancer's public IP address, so that the user-managed load balancer can manage ingress traffic for your cluster. Mandatory parameter.

1. Use the curl CLI command to verify that the user-managed load balancer and DNS record configuration are operational:
1. Verify that you can access the cluster API, by running the following command and observing the output:

# Specifying a floating IP address in the Ingress Controller

To establish external access to your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on OpenStack, use the automatically assigned floating IP address. The floating IP address is associated with your Ingress port.

You might want to precreate a floating IP address before updating your DNS records and cluster deployment. In this situation, you can define a floating IP address to the Ingress Controller. You can do this regardless of whether you are using Octavia or a user-managed cluster.

1. Create the Ingress Controller custom resource (CR) file with the floating IPs:
Example Ingress config sample-ingress.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: IngressController
metadata:
  namespace: openshift-ingress-operator
  name: <name>
spec:
  domain: <domain>
  endpointPublishingStrategy:
    type: LoadBalancerService
    loadBalancer:
      scope: External
      providerParameters:
        type: OpenStack
        openstack:
          floatingIP: <ingress_port_IP>
```


where:
metadata.name:: Specifies the name of your Ingress Controller. If you are using the default Ingress Controller, the value for this field is default.
spec.domain:: Specifies the DNS name serviced by the Ingress Controller.
loadBalancer.scope:: You must set the scope to External to use a floating IP address.
openstack.floatingIP:: Specifies the floating IP address associated with the port your Ingress Controller is listening on.
2. Apply the CR file by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f sample-ingress.yaml
```

3. Update your DNS records with the Ingress Controller endpoint:

```text
*.apps.<name>.<domain>. IN A <ingress_port_IP>
```

4. Continue with creating your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

* Confirm that the load balancer was successfully provisioned by checking the IngressController conditions using the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get ingresscontroller -n openshift-ingress-operator <name> -o jsonpath="{.status.conditions}" | yq -PC
```
