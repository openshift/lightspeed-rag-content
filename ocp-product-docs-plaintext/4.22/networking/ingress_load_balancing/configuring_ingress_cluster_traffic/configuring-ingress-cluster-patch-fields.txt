# Patching existing ingress objects


You can update or modify the following fields of existing Ingress objects without recreating the objects or disrupting services to these objects:
* Specifications
* Host
* Path
* Backend services
* SSL/TLS settings
* Annotations

# Patching Ingress objects to resolve an ingressWithoutClassName alert

To prevent certain routing issues, you must define define the ingressClassName field for each Ingress object.


[NOTE]
----
Approximately 24 hours after you create an Ingress object, the Ingress Controller sends you an ingressWithoutClassName alert to remind you to set the ingressClassName field.
----

The procedure demonstrates patching the Ingress objects with a completed ingressClassName field to ensure proper routing and functionality.

1. List all IngressClass objects:

```terminal
$ oc get ingressclass
```

2. List all Ingress objects in all namespaces:

```terminal
$ oc get ingress -A
```

3. Patch the Ingress object by running the following command. This command patches the Ingress object to include the desired ingress class name.

```terminal
$ oc patch ingress/<ingress_name> --type=merge --patch '{"spec":{"ingressClassName":"openshift-default"}}'
```

* <ingress_name>: Replace <ingress_name> with the name of the Ingress object.
