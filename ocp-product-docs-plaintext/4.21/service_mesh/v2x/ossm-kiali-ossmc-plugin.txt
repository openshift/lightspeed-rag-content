# OpenShift Service Mesh Console plugin


The OpenShift Service Mesh Console (OSSMC) plugin is an extension to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console that provides visibility into your Service Mesh. With the OSSMC plugin installed, a new Service Mesh menu option is available in the navigation menu on the left side of the web console, as well as new Service Mesh tabs that enhance the existing Workloads and Services console pages.

[IMPORTANT]
----
If you are using a certificate that your browser does not initially trust, you must tell your browser to trust the certificate first before you are able to access the OSSMC plugin. To do this, go to the Kiali standalone user interface (UI) and tell the browser to accept its certificate.

# About the OpenShift Service Mesh Console plugin

The OpenShift Service Mesh Console (OSSMC) plugin is an extension to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console that provides visibility into your Service Mesh.


[WARNING]
----
The OSSMC plugin only supports a single Kiali instance. Whether that Kiali instance is configured to access only a subset of OpenShift projects or has access cluster-wide to all projects does not matter. However, only a single Kiali instance can be accessed.
----

You can install the OSSMC plugin in only one of two ways: using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, or through the CLI.


[NOTE]
----
The OSSMC plugin is only supported on Service Mesh 2.5 or later. Specifically, the ServiceMeshControlPlane version must be set to 2.5 or later.
----

Installing the OSSMC plugin creates a new category, Service Mesh, in the main Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console navigation. Click Service Mesh to see:

* Overview for a summary of your mesh displayed as cards that represent the namespaces in the mesh
* Graph for a full topology view of your mesh represented by nodes and edges, each node representing a component of the mesh and each edge representing traffic flowing through the mesh between components
* Istio config for a list of all Istio configuration files in your mesh with a column that provides a quick way to know if the configuration for each resource is valid

Under Workloads, the OSSMC plugin adds a Service Mesh tab that contains the following subtabs:

* Overview subtab provides a summary of the selected workload including a localized topology graph showing the workload with all inbound and outbound edges and nodes
* Traffic subtab displays information about all inbound and outbound traffic to the workload.
* Logs subtab shows the logs for the workload's containers
* You can view container logs individually or in a unified fashion, ordered by log time. This is especially helpful to see how the Envoy sidecar proxy logs relate to your workload's application logs.
* You can enable the tracing span integration which then allows you to see which logs correspond to trace spans.
* Metrics subtab shows both inbound and outbound metric graphs in the corresponding subtabs. All the workload metrics can be displayed here, providing you with a detail view of the performance of your workload.
* You can enable the tracing span integration which allows you to see which spans occurred at the same time as the metrics. Click a span marker in the graph to view the specific spans associated with that timeframe.
* Traces provides a chart showing the trace spans collected over the given timeframe.
* Click a bubble to drill down into those trace spans; the trace spans can provide you the most low-level detail within your workload application, down to the individual request level. The trace details view gives further details, including heatmaps that provide you with a comparison of one span in relation to other requests and spans in the same timeframe.
* If you hover over a cell in a heatmap, a tooltip gives some details on the cell data.
* Envoy subtab provides information about the Envoy sidecar configuration. This is useful when you need to dig down deep into the sidecar configuration when debugging things such as connectivity issues.

Under Networking, the OSSMC plugin adds a Service Mesh tab to Services and contains the Overview, Traffic, Inbound Metrics, and Traces subtabs that are similar to the same subtabs found in Workloads.

# Installing OpenShift Service Mesh Console plugin using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console

You can install the OpenShift Service Mesh Console (OSSMC) plugin using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is installed.
* Kiali Operator provided by Red Hat 1.73 is installed.
* Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh (OSSM) is installed.
* ServiceMeshControlPlane 2.5 or later is installed.

1. Navigate to Installed Operators.
2. Click Kiali Operator provided by Red Hat.
3. Click Create instance on the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh tile.
4. Use the Create OSSMConsole form to create an instance of the OSSMConsole custom resource (CR).
* Name and Version are required fields.

[NOTE]
----
The Version field must match the spec.version field in your Kiali CR.
----
5. Click Create.
6. Navigate back to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console and use the new menu options for visibility into your Service Mesh.

# Installing OpenShift Service Mesh Console plugin using the CLI

You can install the OpenShift Service Mesh Console (OSSMC) plugin using the CLI, instead of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is installed.
* Kiali Operator provided by Red Hat 1.73 is installed.
* Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh (OSSM) is installed.
* ServiceMeshControlPlane (SMCP) 2.5 or later is installed.

1. Create a small OSSMConsole custom resource (CR) to instruct the operator to install the plugin:

```yaml
cat <<EOM | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: kiali.io/v1alpha1
kind: OSSMConsole
metadata:
  namespace: openshift-operators
  name: ossmconsole
EOM
```


[NOTE]
----
The plugin resources are deployed in the same namespace where the OSSMConsole CR is created.
----
2. Go to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.
3. Refresh the browser window to see the new OSSMC plugin menu options.

# Uninstalling OpenShift Service Mesh Console plugin using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console

You can uninstall the OpenShift Service Mesh Console (OSSMC) plugin by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

1. Navigate to Installed Operators -> Operator details.
2. Select the OpenShift Service Mesh Console tab.
3. Click Delete OSSMConsole from the options menu.


[NOTE]
----
If you intend to also uninstall the Kiali Operator provided by Red Hat, you must first uninstall the OSSMC plugin and then uninstall the Operator. If you uninstall the Operator before ensuring the OSSMConsole CR is deleted then you may have difficulty removing that CR and its namespace. If this occurs then you must manually remove the finalizer on the CR in order to delete it and its namespace. You can do this using: $ oc patch ossmconsoles <CR name> -n <CR namespace> -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers": []}}' --type=merge.
----

# Uninstalling OpenShift Service Mesh Console plugin using the CLI

You can uninstall the OpenShift Service Mesh Console (OSSMC) plugin by using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

1. Remove the OSSMC custom resource (CR) by running the following command:

```terminal
 oc delete ossmconsoles <custom_resource_name> -n <custom_resource_namespace>
```

2. Verify all CRs are deleted from all namespaces by running the following command:

```terminal
for r in $(oc get ossmconsoles --ignore-not-found=true --all-namespaces -o custom-columns=NS:.metadata.namespace,N:.metadata.name --no-headers | sed 's/  */:/g'); do oc delete ossmconsoles -n $(echo $r|cut -d: -f1) $(echo $r|cut -d: -f2); done
```
