# Alertmanager [monitoring.coreos.com/v1]


Description:: 
The Alertmanager custom resource definition (CRD) defines a desired [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting) setup to run in a Kubernetes cluster. It allows to specify many options such as the number of replicas, persistent storage and many more.
For each Alertmanager resource, the Operator deploys a StatefulSet in the same namespace. When there are two or more configured replicas, the Operator runs the Alertmanager instances in high-availability mode.
The resource defines via label and namespace selectors which AlertmanagerConfig objects should be associated to the deployed Alertmanager instances.

More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/ephemeral-volumes/#generic-ephemeral-volumes
Type:: object



## .spec.storage.ephemeral.volumeClaimTemplate

Description:: 
Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
pod.  The name of the PVC will be <pod name>-<volume name> where
<volume name> is the name from the PodSpec.Volumes array
entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).
An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
will not be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
manually reconstructing a broken cluster.
This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetes
to the PVC after it has been created.

If the provisioner or an external controller can support the specified data source,
it will create a new volume based on the contents of the specified data source.
When the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is enabled, dataSource contents will be copied to dataSourceRef,
and dataSourceRef contents will be copied to dataSource when dataSourceRef.namespace is not specified.
If the namespace is specified, then dataSourceRef will not be copied to dataSource.
Type:: object
Required::

* name



## .spec.storage.ephemeral.volumeClaimTemplate.spec.dataSourceRef

Description:: 
dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty

core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
provisioner.
This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
* While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
* While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
  specified.
* While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
  in any namespaces.

Description:: 
ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
and deleted when the pod is removed.
Use this if:
a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
   tracking are needed,
c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
   a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
   information on the connection between this volume type
   and PersistentVolumeClaim).
Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
of an individual pod.
Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
more information.
A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
persistent volumes at the same time.
Type:: object



## .spec.volumes[].ephemeral.volumeClaimTemplate

Description:: 
Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.

<volume name> is the name from the PodSpec.Volumes array

is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).
An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod

## .spec.volumes[].image

Description:: 
image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:
* Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
* Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
* IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[].volumeMounts.subpath) before 1.33.
The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

Type:: object
Required:: 
* resource



## .spec.volumes[].projected.sources[].podCertificate

Description:: 
Projects an auto-rotating credential bundle (private key and certificate
chain) that the pod can use either as a TLS client or server.
Kubelet generates a private key and uses it to send a
PodCertificateRequest to the named signer.  Once the signer approves the
request and issues a certificate chain, Kubelet writes the key and
certificate chain to the pod filesystem.  The pod does not start until
certificates have been issued for each podCertificate projected volume
source in its spec.
Kubelet will begin trying to rotate the certificate at the time indicated
by the signer using the PodCertificateRequest.Status.BeginRefreshAt
timestamp.
Kubelet can write a single file, indicated by the credentialBundlePath
field, or separate files, indicated by the keyPath and
certificateChainPath fields.
The credential bundle is a single file in PEM format.  The first PEM
entry is the private key (in PKCS#8 format), and the remaining PEM
entries are the certificate chain issued by the signer (typically,
signers will return their certificate chain in leaf-to-root order).
Prefer using the credential bundle format, since your application code
can read it atomically.  If you use keyPath and certificateChainPath,
your application must make two separate file reads. If these coincide
with a certificate rotation, it is possible that the private key and leaf
certificate you read may not correspond to each other.  Your application
will need to check for this condition, and re-read until they are
consistent.
The named signer controls chooses the format of the certificate it
issues; consult the signer implementation's documentation to learn how to
use the certificates it issues.
Type:: object
Required:: 
* keyType
* signerName

present. If a key is specified which is not present in the Secret,
the volume setup will error unless it is marked optional. Paths must be
