Type:: object
Required:: 
* releases



## .spec.releases

Description:: 
releases is a list of release bundle identifiers that the user wants to
add/remove to/from the control plane nodes.
Entries must be unique, keyed on the name field.
releases must contain at least one entry and must not exceed 16 entries.
Type:: array

## .spec.releases[]

Description:: 
InternalReleaseImageRef is used to provide a simple reference for a release
bundle. Currently it contains only the name field.
Type:: object
Required:: 
* name



## .status

Description:: 
status describes the last observed state of this internal release image.
Type:: object
Required:: 
* releases



## .status.conditions

Description:: 
conditions represent the observations of the InternalReleaseImage controller current state.
Valid types are: Degraded.
If Degraded is true, that means something has gone wrong in the controller.
Type:: array

## .status.conditions[]

Description:: 
Condition contains details for one aspect of the current state of this API Resource.
Type:: object
Required:: 
* lastTransitionTime
* message
* reason
* status
* type



## .status.releases

Description:: 
releases is a list of the release bundles currently owned and managed by the
cluster.
A release bundle content could be safely pulled only when its Conditions field
contains at least an Available entry set to "True" and Degraded to "False".
Entries must be unique, keyed on the name field.
releases must contain at least one entry and must not exceed 32 entries.
Type:: array

## .status.releases[]

Description:: 

Type:: object
Required:: 
* name



## .status.releases[].conditions

Description:: 
conditions represent the observations of an internal release image current state. Valid types are:
Mounted, Installing, Available, Removing and Degraded.
If Mounted is true, that means that a valid ISO has been discovered and mounted on one of the cluster nodes.
If Installing is true, that means that a new release bundle is currently being copied on one (or more) cluster nodes, and not yet completed.
If Available is true, it means that the release has been previously installed on all the cluster nodes, and it can be used.
If Removing is true, it means that a release deletion is in progress on one (or more) cluster nodes, and not yet completed.
If Degraded is true, that means something has gone wrong (possibly on one or more cluster nodes).
In general, after installing a new release bundle, it is required to wait for the Conditions "Available" to become "True" (and all
the other conditions to be equal to "False") before being able to pull its content.
