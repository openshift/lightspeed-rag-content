# Creating a project as another user


Impersonation allows you to create a project as a different user.

# API impersonation

You can configure a request to the {product-title} API to act as though it originated from another user. For more information, see User impersonation in the Kubernetes documentation.

# Impersonating a user when you create a project

You can impersonate a different user when you create a project request. Because
system:authenticated:oauth is the only bootstrap group that can
create project requests, you must impersonate that group.

* To create a project request on behalf of a different user:

```terminal
$ oc new-project <project> --as=<user> \
    --as-group=system:authenticated --as-group=system:authenticated:oauth
```
