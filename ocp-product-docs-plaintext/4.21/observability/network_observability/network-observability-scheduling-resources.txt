# Scheduling resources

Taints and tolerations help you control which nodes host certain pods. Use these tools, along with node selectors, to guide the placement of network observability components.
A node selector specifies a map of key/value pairs that are defined using custom labels on nodes and selectors specified in pods.
For the pod to be eligible to run on a node, the pod must have the same key/value node selector as the label on the node.

# Network observability deployment in specific nodes

Configure the FlowCollector resource using scheduling specifications, including NodeSelector, Tolerations, and Affinity, to control the deployment of network observability components on specific nodes.

The spec.agent.ebpf.advanced.scheduling, spec.processor.advanced.scheduling, and spec.consolePlugin.advanced.scheduling specifications have the following configurable settings:

* NodeSelector
* Tolerations
* Affinity
* PriorityClassName


```yaml
apiVersion: flows.netobserv.io/v1beta2
kind: FlowCollector

  name: cluster
