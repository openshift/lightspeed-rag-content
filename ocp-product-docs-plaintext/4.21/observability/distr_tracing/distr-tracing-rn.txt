# Fixed issues

The Distributed Tracing Platform 3.8.1 patch release includes a fix for the following issue:

CVE-2025-58183:: Before this update, malicious tar archives could be used for denial of service by triggering memory overuse by the tar.Reader decompressor. With this update, the Go version upgrade to 1.25.3 enforces a maximum limit on the count of sparse region data blocks. As a result, memory usage when processing these archives is bounded and secure.

CVE-2025-58183

The Distributed Tracing Platform 3.8 release fixes the following issues:

Resolved issue with TLS certificates affecting Tempo pods:: Before this update, the Tempo pods stopped communicating because internal TLS certificates were renewed. With this update, the Tempo pods automatically restart when certificates are renewed.

TRACING-5622
Tempo query frontend no longer fails to fetch trace JSON:: Before this update, clicking on Trace in the Jaeger UI and refreshing the page, or accessing Trace -> Trace Timeline -> Trace JSON from the Tempo query frontend, might result in the Tempo query pod failing with an EOF error. With this update, this issue is resolved.

TRACING-5483
