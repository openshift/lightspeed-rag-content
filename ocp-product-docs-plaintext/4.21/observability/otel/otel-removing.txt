# Removing


The steps for removing the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry from an {product-title} cluster are as follows:
1. Shut down all Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry pods.
2. Remove any OpenTelemetryCollector instances.
3. Remove the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator.

# Removing an OpenTelemetry Collector instance by using the web console

You can remove an OpenTelemetry Collector instance in the Administrator view of the web console.

* You are logged in to the web console as a cluster administrator with the cluster-admin role.
* For Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated, you must be logged in using an account with the dedicated-admin role.

1. Go to Ecosystem -> Installed Operators -> Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator -> OpenTelemetryInstrumentation or OpenTelemetryCollector.
2. To remove the relevant instance, select . -> Delete &#8230;&#8203; -> Delete.
3. Optional: Remove the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator.

# Removing an OpenTelemetry Collector instance by using the CLI

You can remove an OpenTelemetry Collector instance on the command line.

* An active OpenShift CLI (`oc`) session by a cluster administrator with the cluster-admin role.

[TIP]
----
* Ensure that your OpenShift CLI (`oc`) version is up to date and matches your {product-title} version.
* Run oc login:

```terminal
$ oc login --username=<your_username>
```

----

1. Get the name of the OpenTelemetry Collector instance by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get deployments -n <project_of_opentelemetry_instance>
```

2. Remove the OpenTelemetry Collector instance by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete opentelemetrycollectors <opentelemetry_instance_name> -n <project_of_opentelemetry_instance>
```

3. Optional: Remove the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator.

* To verify successful removal of the OpenTelemetry Collector instance, run oc get deployments again:

```terminal
$ oc get deployments -n <project_of_opentelemetry_instance>
```
