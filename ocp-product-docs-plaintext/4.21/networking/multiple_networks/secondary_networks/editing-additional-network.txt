# Editing a secondary network


To update network settings or change network parameters for a secondary network in {product-title}, you can modify the configuration for an existing secondary network. Edit the NetworkAttachmentDefinition custom resource to apply your changes.

# Modifying a NetworkAttachmentDefinition custom resource

To update network settings or change network parameters for a secondary network in {product-title}, you can modify the NetworkAttachmentDefinition custom resource. Edit the Cluster Network Operator CR to apply your changes.

* You have configured a secondary network for your cluster.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

1. Edit the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) CR in your default text editor by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc edit networks.operator.openshift.io cluster
```

2. In the additionalNetworks collection, update the secondary network with your changes.
3. Save your changes and quit the text editor to commit your changes.
4. Optional: Confirm that the CNO updated the NetworkAttachmentDefinition object by running the following command. Replace <network_name> with the name of the secondary network to display. There might be a delay before the CNO updates the NetworkAttachmentDefinition object to reflect your changes.

```terminal
$ oc get network-attachment-definitions <network_name> -o yaml
```


For example, the following console output displays a NetworkAttachmentDefinition object that is named net1:

```terminal
$ oc get network-attachment-definitions net1 -o go-template='{{printf "%s\n" .spec.config}}'
{ "cniVersion": "0.3.1", "type": "macvlan",
"master": "ens5",
"mode": "bridge",
"ipam":       {"type":"static","routes":[{"dst":"0.0.0.0/0","gw":"10.128.2.1"}],"addresses":[{"address":"10.128.2.100/23","gateway":"10.128.2.1"}],"dns":{"nameservers":["172.30.0.10"],"domain":"us-west-2.compute.internal","search":["us-west-2.compute.internal"]}} }
```
