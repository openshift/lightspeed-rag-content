# Viewing a network policy


As a cluster administrator, you can view a network policy for a namespace.

# Example NetworkPolicy object

The following configuration annotates an example NetworkPolicy object:


```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-27107
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mongodb
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: app
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 27017
```


where:

name:: The name of the NetworkPolicy object.
spec.podSelector:: A selector that describes the pods to which the policy applies.
The policy object can only select pods in the project that defines the NetworkPolicy object.
ingress.from.podSelector:: A selector that matches the pods from which the policy object allows ingress traffic. The selector matches pods in the same namespace as the NetworkPolicy.
ingress.ports:: A list of one or more destination ports on which to accept traffic.

# Viewing network policies using the CLI

You can examine the {name} policies in a namespace.


[NOTE]
----
If you log in with cluster-admin privileges, you can edit network policies in any namespace in the cluster.

[NOTE]
----
If you log in with cluster-admin privileges, you can edit network policies in any namespace in the cluster. In the web console, you can edit policies directly in YAML or by using the Actions menu.

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You are logged in to the cluster with a user with {role} privileges.
* You are working in the namespace where the {name} policy exists.

1. List {name} policies in a namespace.
1. To view {name} policy objects defined in a namespace enter the following
command:

```terminal
$ oc get {name}policy
```

2. Optional: To examine a specific {name} policy enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc describe {name}policy <policy_name> -n <namespace>
```


where:
<policy_name>:: Specifies the name of the {name} policy to inspect.
<namespace>:: Optional: Specifies the namespace if the object is defined in a different namespace than the current namespace.

```terminal
$ oc describe networkpolicy allow-same-namespace
```
