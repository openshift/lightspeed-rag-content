# AWS Load Balancer Operator in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform


To deploy and manage the AWS Load Balancer Controller, install the AWS Load Balancer Operator from the software catalog by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console or CLI. You can use the Operator to integrate AWS load balancers directly into your cluster infrastructure.

# AWS Load Balancer Operator considerations

To ensure a successful deployment, review the limitations of the AWS Load Balancer Operator. Understanding these constraints helps avoid compatibility issues and ensures the Operator meets your architectural requirements before installation.

Review the following limitations before installing and using the AWS Load Balancer Operator:

* The IP traffic mode only works on AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). The AWS Load Balancer Operator disables the IP traffic mode for the AWS Load Balancer Controller. As a result of disabling the IP traffic mode, the AWS Load Balancer Controller cannot use the pod readiness gate.
* The AWS Load Balancer Operator adds command-line flags such as --disable-ingress-class-annotation and --disable-ingress-group-name-annotation to the AWS Load Balancer Controller. Therefore, the AWS Load Balancer Operator does not allow using the kubernetes.io/ingress.class and alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/group.name annotations in the Ingress resource.
* The AWS Load Balancer Operator requires that the service type is NodePort and not LoadBalancer or ClusterIP.

# Deploying the AWS Load Balancer Operator

After you deploy the The AWS Load Balancer Operator, the Operator automatically tags public subnets if the kubernetes.io/role/elb tag is missing. The Operator then identifies specific network resources in the underlying AWS cloud to ensure successful cluster integration.

The AWS Load Balancer Operator detects the following information from the underlying AWS cloud:

* The ID of the virtual private cloud (VPC) on which the cluster hosting the Operator is deployed.
* Public and private subnets of the discovered VPC.

The AWS Load Balancer Operator supports the Kubernetes service resource of type LoadBalancer by using Network Load Balancer (NLB) with the instance target type only.

1. To deploy the AWS Load Balancer Operator on-demand from the software catalog, create a Subscription object by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n aws-load-balancer-operator get sub aws-load-balancer-operator --template='{{.status.installplan.name}}{{"\n"}}'
```

2. Check if the status of an install plan is Complete by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n aws-load-balancer-operator get ip <install_plan_name> --template='{{.status.phase}}{{"\n"}}'
```

3. View the status of the aws-load-balancer-operator-controller-manager deployment by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get -n aws-load-balancer-operator deployment/aws-load-balancer-operator-controller-manager
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                                           READY     UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
aws-load-balancer-operator-controller-manager  1/1       1            1           23h
```


# Using the AWS Load Balancer Operator in an AWS VPC cluster extended into an Outpost

To provision an AWS Application Load Balancer in an AWS VPC cluster extended into an Outpost, configure the AWS Load Balancer Operator. Note that the Operator cannot provision AWS Network Load Balancers because AWS Outposts does not support them.

You can create an AWS Application Load Balancer either in the cloud subnet or in the Outpost subnet.

An Application Load Balancer in the cloud can attach to cloud-based compute nodes. An Application Load Balancer in the Outpost can attach to edge compute nodes.

You must annotate Ingress resources with the Outpost subnet or the VPC subnet, but not both.

* You have extended an AWS VPC cluster into an Outpost.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have installed the AWS Load Balancer Operator and created the AWS Load Balancer Controller.

* Configure the Ingress resource to use a specified subnet:
Example Ingress resource configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: <application_name>
  annotations:
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/subnets: <subnet_id>
spec:
  ingressClassName: alb
  rules:
    - http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Exact
            backend:
              service:
                name: <application_name>
                port:
                  number: 80
```


where:
<subnet_id>:: Specifies the subnet to use. To use the Application Load Balancer in an Outpost, specify the Outpost subnet ID. To use the Application Load Balancer in the cloud, you must specify at least two subnets in different availability zones.
