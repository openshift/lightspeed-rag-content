# Creating DNS records on Google Cloud


You can create DNS records on Google Cloud by using the External DNS Operator.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Using the External DNS Operator on a cluster with Google Cloud Workload Identity enabled is not supported. For more information about the Google Cloud Workload Identity, see Google Cloud Workload Identity.

# Creating DNS records on a public managed zone for Google Cloud

You can create DNS records on a public managed zone for Google Cloud by using the External DNS Operator.

* You must have administrator privileges.

1. Copy the gcp-credentials secret in the encoded-gcloud.json file by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get secret gcp-credentials -n kube-system --template='{{$v := index .data "service_account.json"}}{{$v}}' | base64 -d - > decoded-gcloud.json
```

2. Export your Google credentials by running the following command:

```terminal
$ export GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS=decoded-gcloud.json
```

3. Activate your account by using the following command:

```terminal
$ gcloud auth activate-service-account  <client_email as per decoded-gcloud.json> --key-file=decoded-gcloud.json
```

4. Set your project by running the following command:

```terminal
$ gcloud config set project <project_id as per decoded-gcloud.json>
```

5. Get a list of routes by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get routes --all-namespaces | grep console
```

Example output

```terminal
openshift-console          console             console-openshift-console.apps.test.gcp.example.com                       console             https   reencrypt/Redirect     None
openshift-console          downloads           downloads-openshift-console.apps.test.gcp.example.com                     downloads           http    edge/Redirect          None
```

6. Get a list of managed zones, such as qe-cvs4g-private-zone test.gcp.example.com, by running the following command:

```terminal
$ gcloud dns managed-zones list | grep test.gcp.example.com
```

7. Create a YAML file, for example, external-dns-sample-gcp.yaml, that defines the ExternalDNS object:
Example external-dns-sample-gcp.yaml file

```yaml
apiVersion: externaldns.olm.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: ExternalDNS
metadata:
  name: sample-gcp 1
spec:
  domains:
    - filterType: Include 2
      matchType: Exact 3
      name: test.gcp.example.com 4
  provider:
    type: GCP 5
  source:
    openshiftRouteOptions: 6
      routerName: default 7
    type: OpenShiftRoute 8
```

Specifies the External DNS name.
By default, all hosted zones are selected as potential targets. You can include your hosted zone.
The domain of the target must match the string defined by the name key.
Specify the exact domain of the zone you want to update. The hostname of the routes must be subdomains of the specified domain.
Defines the provider type.
You can define options for the source of DNS records.
If the source type is OpenShiftRoute, you can pass the OpenShift Ingress Controller name. External DNS selects the canonical hostname of that router as the target while creating CNAME record.
Defines the route resource as the source for Google Cloud DNS records.
8. Check the DNS records created for {product-title} routes by running the following command:

```terminal
$ gcloud dns record-sets list --zone=qe-cvs4g-private-zone | grep console
```
