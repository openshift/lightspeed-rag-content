# Installing the External DNS Operator


You can install the External DNS Operator on cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.

# Installing the External DNS Operator with the software catalog

You can install the External DNS Operator by using the {product-title} software catalog.

1. Click Ecosystem -> Software Catalog in the {product-title} web console.
2. Click External DNS Operator.
You can use the Filter by keyword text box or the filter list to search for External DNS Operator from the list of Operators.
3. Select the external-dns-operator namespace.
4. On the External DNS Operator page, click Install.
5. On the Install Operator page, ensure that you selected the following options:
1. Update the channel as stable-v1.
2. Installation mode as A specific name on the cluster.
3. Installed namespace as external-dns-operator. If namespace external-dns-operator does not exist, it gets created during the Operator installation.
4. Select Approval Strategy as Automatic or Manual. Approval Strategy is set to Automatic by default.
5. Click Install.

If you select Automatic updates, the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically upgrades the running instance of your Operator without any intervention.

If you select Manual updates, the OLM creates an update request. As a cluster administrator, you must then manually approve that update request to have the Operator updated to the new version.

Verify that the External DNS Operator shows the Status as Succeeded on the Installed Operators dashboard.
