# Configuring ingress cluster traffic using a load balancer


{product-title} provides methods for communicating from
outside the cluster with services running in the cluster. This method uses a
load balancer.

# Using a load balancer to get traffic into the cluster

If you do not need a specific external IP address, you can configure a load
balancer service to allow external access to an {product-title} cluster.

A load balancer service allocates a unique IP. The load balancer has a single
edge router IP, which can be a virtual IP (VIP), but is still a single machine
for initial load balancing.


[NOTE]
----
If a pool is configured, it is done at the infrastructure level, not by a cluster
administrator.
----


[NOTE]
----
The procedures in this section require prerequisites performed by the cluster
administrator.
----

# Prerequisites

Before starting the following procedures, the administrator must:

* Set up the external port to the cluster networking environment so that requests
can reach the cluster.
* Make sure there is at least one user with cluster admin role. To add this role
to a user, run the following command:

```
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin username
```

* Have an {product-title} cluster with at least one master and at least one node
and a system outside the cluster that has network access to the cluster. This
procedure assumes that the external system is on the same subnet as the cluster.
The additional networking required for external systems on a different subnet is
out-of-scope for this topic.

# Creating a project and service

If the project and service that you want to expose does not exist, create the project and then create the service.

If the project and service already exists, skip to the procedure on exposing the service to create a route.

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) and log in as a cluster administrator.

1. Create a new project for your service by running the oc new-project command:

```terminal
$ oc new-project <project_name>
```

2. Use the oc new-app command to create your service:

```terminal
$ oc new-app nodejs:12~https://github.com/sclorg/nodejs-ex.git
```

3. To verify that the service was created, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get svc -n <project_name>
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME        TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
nodejs-ex   ClusterIP   172.30.197.157   <none>        8080/TCP   70s
```


[NOTE]
----
By default, the new service does not have an external IP address.
----

# Exposing the service by creating a route

You can expose the service as a route by using the oc expose command.

* You logged into {product-title}.

1. Log in to the project where the service you want to expose is located:

```terminal
$ oc project <project_name>
```

2. Run the oc expose service command to expose the route:

```terminal
$ oc expose service nodejs-ex
```

Example output

```terminal
route.route.openshift.io/nodejs-ex exposed
```

3. To verify that the service is exposed, you can use a tool, such as curl to check that the service is accessible from outside the cluster.
1. To find the hostname of the route, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get route
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME        HOST/PORT                        PATH   SERVICES    PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
nodejs-ex   nodejs-ex-myproject.example.com         nodejs-ex   8080-tcp                 None
```

2. To check that the host responds to a GET request, enter the following command:
Example curl command

```terminal
$ curl --head nodejs-ex-myproject.example.com
```

Example output

```terminal
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
```


# Creating a load balancer service

Use the following procedure to create a load balancer service.

* Make sure that the project and service you want to expose exist.
* Your cloud provider supports load balancers.

To create a load balancer service:

1. Log in to  {product-title}.
2. Load the project where the service you want to expose is located.

```terminal
$ oc project project1
```

3. Open a text file on the control plane node and paste the following text, editing the
file as needed:
Sample load balancer configuration file

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: egress-2 1
spec:
  ports:
  - name: db
    port: 3306 2
  loadBalancerIP:
  loadBalancerSourceRanges: 3
  - 10.0.0.0/8
  - 192.168.0.0/16
  type: LoadBalancer 4
  selector:
    name: mysql 5
```

Enter a descriptive name for the load balancer service.
Enter the same port that the service you want to expose is listening on.
Enter a list of specific IP addresses to restrict traffic through the load balancer. This field is ignored if the cloud-provider does not support the feature.
Enter Loadbalancer as the type.
Enter the name of the service.

[NOTE]
----
To restrict the traffic through the load balancer to specific IP addresses, it is recommended to use the Ingress Controller field spec.endpointPublishingStrategy.loadBalancer.allowedSourceRanges. Do not set the loadBalancerSourceRanges field.
----
4. Save and exit the file.
5. Run the following command to create the service:

```terminal
$ oc create -f <file-name>
```


For example:

```terminal
$ oc create -f mysql-lb.yaml
```

6. Execute the following command to view the new service:

```terminal
$ oc get svc
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME       TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP                             PORT(S)          AGE
egress-2   LoadBalancer   172.30.22.226   ad42f5d8b303045-487804948.example.com   3306:30357/TCP   15m
```


The service has an external IP address automatically assigned if there is a cloud
provider enabled.
7. On the master, use a tool, such as cURL, to make sure you can reach the service
using the public IP address:

```terminal
$ curl <public-ip>:<port>
```


For example:

```terminal
$ curl 172.29.121.74:3306
```


The examples in this section use a MySQL service, which requires a client application.
If you get a string of characters with the Got packets out of order message,
you are connecting with the service:

If you have a MySQL client, log in with the standard CLI command:

```terminal
$ mysql -h 172.30.131.89 -u admin -p
```

Example output

```terminal
Enter password:
Welcome to the MariaDB monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.

MySQL [(none)]>
```
