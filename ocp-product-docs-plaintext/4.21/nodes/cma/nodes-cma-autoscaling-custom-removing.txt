# Removing the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator


You can remove the custom metrics autoscaler from your {product-title} cluster. After removing the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator, remove other components associated with the Operator to avoid potential issues.

[NOTE]
----
Delete the KedaController custom resource (CR) first. If you do not delete the KedaController CR, {product-title} can hang when you delete the openshift-keda project. If you delete the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator before deleting the CR, you are not able to delete the CR.

* triggerauthentications.keda.sh

```terminal
$ oc delete crd clustertriggerauthentications.keda.sh kedacontrollers.keda.sh scaledjobs.keda.sh scaledobjects.keda.sh triggerauthentications.keda.sh

```terminal
$ oc delete clusterrole.keda.sh-v1alpha1-admin
```

4. List any custom metrics autoscaler cluster role bindings:

```terminal
$ oc get clusterrolebinding | grep keda.sh
```

5. Delete the listed custom metrics autoscaler cluster role bindings. For example:

```terminal
$ oc delete clusterrolebinding.keda.sh-v1alpha1-admin
```

6. Delete the custom metrics autoscaler project:

```terminal
$ oc delete project openshift-keda
```

7. Delete the Cluster Metric Autoscaler Operator:

```terminal
