# CCO-based workflow for OLM-managed Operators with GCP Workload Identity


When an {product-title} cluster running on Google Cloud is in GCP Workload Identity / Federated Identity mode, it means the cluster is utilizing features of Google Cloud and {product-title} to apply permissions in GCP Workload Identity at an application level.
The Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) is a cluster Operator installed by default in {product-title} clusters running on cloud providers. Starting in {product-title} 4.17, the CCO supports workflows for OLM-managed Operators with GCP Workload Identity.
For the purposes of GCP Workload Identity, the CCO provides the following functions:
* Detects when it is running on an GCP Workload Identity-enabled cluster
* Checks the CredentialsRequest object for the presence of fields that provide the required information for granting Operators access to Google Cloud resources
The CCO can semi-automate this process through an expanded use of CredentialsRequest objects, which can request the creation of Secrets that contain the information required for GCP Workload Identity workflows.

[NOTE]
----
Subscriptions with automatic approvals for updates are not recommended because there might be permission changes to make before updating. Subscriptions with manual approvals for updates ensure that administrators have the opportunity to verify the permissions of the later version, take any necessary steps, and then update.
----
As an Operator author preparing an Operator for use alongside the updated CCO in {product-title} 4.17 and later, you should instruct users and add code to handle the divergence from earlier CCO versions, in addition to handling GCP Workload Identity token authentication (if your Operator is not already enabled). The recommended method is to provide a CredentialsRequest object with the correctly filled GCP Workload Identity fields and let the CCO create the Secret object for you.

[IMPORTANT]
----
If you plan to support {product-title} clusters earlier than version 4.17, consider providing users with instructions on how to manually create a secret with the GCP Workload Identity-enabling information by using the CCO utility (ccoctl). Earlier CCO versions are unaware of GCP Workload Identity mode on the cluster and cannot create secrets for you.
Your code should check for secrets that never appear and warn users to follow the fallback instructions you have provided.
----
To authenticate with Google Cloud using short-lived tokens via Google Cloud Platform Workload Identity, Operators must provide the following information:
AUDIENCE:: Created in Google Cloud by the administrator when they set up GCP Workload Identity, the AUDIENCE value must be a preformatted URL in the following format:

```text
//iam.googleapis.com/projects/<project_number>/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/<pool_id>/providers/<provider_id>
```

SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL:: The SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL value is a Google Cloud service account email that is impersonated during Operator operation, for example:

```text
<service_account_name>@<project_id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

The Install Operator page in the web console allows cluster administrators to provide this information at installation time. This information is then propagated to the Subscription object as environment variables on the Operator pod.

* Installing from OperatorHub using the web console
* Installing from OperatorHub using the CLI

# Enabling Operators to support CCO-based workflows with GCP Workload Identity

As an Operator author designing your project to run on Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), you can enable your Operator to authenticate against Google Cloud Platform Workload Identity on {product-title} clusters by customizing your project to support the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO).

With this method, the Operator is responsible for and requires RBAC permissions for creating the CredentialsRequest object and reading the resulting Secret object.


[NOTE]
----
By default, pods related to the Operator deployment mount a serviceAccountToken volume so that the service account token can be referenced in the resulting Secret object.
----

* {product-title} 4.17 or later
* Cluster in GCP Workload Identity / Federated Identity mode
* OLM-based Operator project

1. Update your Operator project's ClusterServiceVersion (CSV) object:
1. Ensure Operator deployment in the CSV has the following volumeMounts and volumes fields so that the Operator can assume the role with web identity:
Example volumeMounts and volumes fields

```yaml
# ...
      volumeMounts:

      - name: bound-sa-token
        mountPath: /var/run/secrets/openshift/serviceaccount
        readOnly: true
      volumes:
         # This service account token can be used to provide identity outside the cluster.
         - name: bound-sa-token
           projected:
             sources:
             - serviceAccountToken:
               path: token
               audience: openshift
```
2. Ensure your Operator has RBAC permission to create CredentialsRequests objects:
Example clusterPermissions list

```yaml
# ...
install:
  spec:
    clusterPermissions:
    - rules:
      - apiGroups:
        - "cloudcredential.openshift.io"
        resources:
        - credentialsrequests
        verbs:
        - create
        - delete
        - get
        - list
        - patch
        - update
        - watch
```
3. Add the following annotation to claim support for this method of CCO-based workflow with GCP Workload Identity:

```yaml
# ...
metadata:
 annotations:
   features.operators.openshift.io/token-auth-gcp: "true"
```

2. Update your Operator project code:
1. Get the audience and the serviceAccountEmail values from the environment variables set on the pod by the subscription config:

```go
 // Get ENV var
   audience := os.Getenv("AUDIENCE")
   serviceAccountEmail := os.Getenv("SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL")
   gcpIdentityTokenFile := "/var/run/secrets/openshift/serviceaccount/token"
```

2. Ensure you have a CredentialsRequest object ready to be patched and applied.

[NOTE]
----
Adding a CredentialsRequest object to the Operator bundle is not currently supported.
----
3. Add the GCP Workload Identity variables to the credentials request and apply it during Operator initialization:
Example applying CredentialsRequest object during Operator initialization

```go
// apply CredentialsRequest on install
   credReqTemplate.Spec.GCPProviderSpec.Audience = audience
   credReqTemplate.Spec.GCPProviderSpec.ServiceAccountEmail = serviceAccountEmail
   credReqTemplate.CloudTokenPath = gcpIdentityTokenFile


   c := mgr.GetClient()
   if err := c.Create(context.TODO(), credReq); err != nil {
       if !errors.IsAlreadyExists(err) {
           setupLog.Error(err, "unable to create CredRequest")
           os.Exit(1)
       }
   }
```
4. Ensure your Operator can wait for a Secret object to show up from the CCO, as shown in the following example, which is called along with the other items you are reconciling in your Operator:
Example wait for Secret object

```go
// WaitForSecret is a function that takes a Kubernetes client, a namespace, and a v1 "k8s.io/api/core/v1" name as arguments
// It waits until the secret object with the given name exists in the given namespace
// It returns the secret object or an error if the timeout is exceeded
func WaitForSecret(client kubernetes.Interface, namespace, name string) (*v1.Secret, error) {
  // set a timeout of 10 minutes
  timeout := time.After(10 * time.Minute) 1

  // set a polling interval of 10 seconds
  ticker := time.NewTicker(10 * time.Second)

  // loop until the timeout or the secret is found
  for {
     select {
     case <-timeout:
        // timeout is exceeded, return an error
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("timed out waiting for secret %s in namespace %s", name, namespace)
// add to this error with a pointer to instructions for following a manual path to a Secret that will work
     case <-ticker.C:
        // polling interval is reached, try to get the secret
        secret, err := client.CoreV1().Secrets(namespace).Get(context.Background(), name, metav1.GetOptions{})
        if err != nil {
           if errors.IsNotFound(err) {
              // secret does not exist yet, continue waiting
              continue
           } else {
              // some other error occurred, return it
              return nil, err
           }
        } else {
           // secret is found, return it
           return secret, nil
        }
     }
  }
}
```

The timeout value is based on an estimate of how fast the CCO might detect an added CredentialsRequest object and generate a Secret object. You might consider lowering the time or creating custom feedback for cluster administrators that could be wondering why the Operator is not yet accessing the cloud resources.
5. Read the service_account.json field from the secret and use it to authenticate your Google Cloud client:

```go
service_account_json := secret.StringData["service_account.json"]
```
