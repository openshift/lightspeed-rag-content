# Preventing node reconciliation


Use skip-node annotation to prevent the node-labeller from reconciling a node.

# Using skip-node annotation

If you want the node-labeller to skip a node, annotate that node by using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* Annotate the node that you want to skip by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc annotate node <node_name> node-labeller.kubevirt.io/skip-node=true
```


Replace <node_name> with the name of the relevant node to skip.

Reconciliation resumes on the next cycle after the node annotation is removed or set to false.
