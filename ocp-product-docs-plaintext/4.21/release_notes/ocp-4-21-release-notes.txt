# {product-title} {product-version} release notes


Red Hat {product-title} provides developers and IT organizations with a hybrid cloud application platform for deploying both new and existing applications on secure, scalable resources with minimal configuration and management. {product-title} supports a wide selection of programming languages and frameworks, such as Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and PHP.
Built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and Kubernetes, {product-title} provides a more secure and scalable multitenant operating system for today's enterprise-class applications, while delivering integrated application runtimes and libraries. {product-title} enables organizations to meet security, privacy, compliance, and governance requirements.

# About this release

{product-title} (RHSA-2025:9562) is now available. This release uses Kubernetes 1.34 with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to {product-title} {product-version} are included in this topic.

{product-title} {product-version} clusters are available at https://console.redhat.com/openshift. From the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console, you can deploy {product-title} clusters to either on-premises or cloud environments.

You must use RHCOS machines for the control plane and for the compute machines.

Starting from {product-title} 4.14, the Extended Update Support (EUS) phase for even-numbered releases increases the total available lifecycle to 24 months on all supported architectures, including x86_64, 64-bit ARM (aarch64), IBM Power&#174; (ppc64le), and IBM Z&#174; (s390x) architectures. Beyond this, Red&#160;Hat also offers a 12-month additional EUS add-on, denoted as Additional EUS Term 2, that extends the total available lifecycle from 24 months to 36 months. The Additional EUS Term 2 is available on all architecture variants of {product-title}. For more information about support for all versions, see the Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy.

{product-title} is designed for FIPS. When running Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) booted in FIPS mode, {product-title} core components use the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures.

For more information about the NIST validation program, see Cryptographic Module Validation Program. For the latest NIST status for the individual versions of RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted for validation, see Compliance Activities and Government Standards.

# {product-title} layered and dependent component support and compatibility

The scope of support for layered and dependent components of {product-title} changes independently of the {product-title} version. To determine the current support status and compatibility for an add-on, refer to its release notes. For more information, see the Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy.

# New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts:

## API server



## Edge computing



## etcd



## Extensions (OLM v1)



## Hosted control planes



## IBM Power



## IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE



## IBM Power, IBM Z, and IBM LinuxOne support matrix



## Insights Operator



## Installation and update

Installing a cluster on Microsoft Azure uses Marketplace images by default:: 

As of this update, the {product-title} installation program uses Marketplace images by default when installing a cluster on Azure. This speeds up the installation by removing the need to upload a virtual hard disk to Azure and create an image during installation. This feature is not supported on Azure Stack Hub, or for Azure installations that use Confidential VMs.

## Machine Config Operator



## Machine management



## Monitoring


[NOTE]
----
The monitoring stack documentation is now available as a separate documentation set. The {product-version} monitoring release notes are available at Release notes for OpenShift monitoring.
----

## Networking

Applying unassisted holdover for boundary clocks and time synchronous clocks:: 

{product-title} 4.20 introduced unassisted holdover for boundary clocks and time synchronous clocks as a Technology Preview feature. This feature is now Generally Available (GA).

For more information, see Applying unassisted holdover for boundary clocks and time slave clocks.
SR-IOV Operator supports ARM architecture:: 

The Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) Operator can now communicate with ARM hardware. You can now complete tasks such as configure network cards that are already plugged into an ARM server and use these cards in your applications. For instructions on how to search for ARM hardware that the SR-IOV Operator supports, see About Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) hardware networks.

## Nodes



## OpenShift CLI (oc)

Signature mirroring enabled by default for oc-mirror v2:: With this update, the oc-mirror v2 plugin mirrors image signatures by default. This enhancement ensures that image integrity is automatically preserved during the mirroring process without requiring additional configuration. If your environment does not require signature validation, you can manually disable this feature by using the --remove-signatures command-line flag. For more information, see Disabling signature mirroring for oc-mirror plugin v2.

## Operator development

Bare Metal Operator has read-only root filesystem by default:: 

As of this update, the Bare Metal Operator has the readOnlyRootFilesystem security context setting enabled to meet common hardening recommendations.

## Operator lifecycle



## Postinstallation configuration



## Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS)



## Scalability and performance

Pod-level IRQ affinity introduces housekeeping mode:: 

For latency-sensitive workloads, you can now configure the irq-load-balancing.crio.io pod annotation to use housekeeping mode. This mode enables a subset of pinned CPUs to handle system interrupts while isolating the remaining pinned CPUs for latency-sensitive workloads. This reduces the overall CPU footprint by eliminating the need for dedicated housekeeping CPUs for IRQ handling. When you configure housekeeping mode, the first pinned CPU and its thread siblings handle interrupts for the system.

For more information, see Configuring interrupt processing for individual pods.

## Support for sigstore bring your own PKI (BYOPKI) image validation
