# About the CLI Manager Operator

You can use the CLI Manager Operator to streamline the installation and management of CLI plugins, especially in disconnected environments.

The CLI Manager Operator makes it easier to install and update CLI plugins. It runs in both connected and disconnected environments, and it is particularly useful in disconnected environments. Cluster administrators can add CLI plugins and plugin updates to the CLI Manager Operator, and users can then install and update CLI plugins when needed regardless of whether or not the environment is disconnected.
