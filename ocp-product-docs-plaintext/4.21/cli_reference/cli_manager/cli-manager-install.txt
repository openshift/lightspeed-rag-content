# Installing the CLI Manager Operator


You can simplify the installation and management of CLI plugins in connected and disconnected environments with the CLI Manager Operator. The CLI Manager Operator makes Krew compatible with the oc CLI, allowing cluster administrators to manage custom CLI plugin resources.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Using the CLI Manager Operator to install and manage plugins for the OpenShift CLI is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.

# Installing the CLI Manager Operator

You can install the CLI Manager Operator to facilitate adding CLI plugins in both connected and disconnected environments.


[NOTE]
----
Krew always works with OpenShift CLI (`oc`) without the CLI Manager Operator installed. You can use the same commands outlined in this documentation to use Krew with oc. For more information, see Krew documentation.

* Krew is installed.
* The CLI Manager Operator is installed.

1. To establish the ROUTE variable, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ ROUTE=$(oc get route/openshift-cli-manager -n openshift-cli-manager-operator -o=jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
```

2. To add the custom index to Krew, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc krew index add <custom_index_name> https://$ROUTE/cli-manager
```

3. To update Krew, enter the following command and check for any errors:

```terminal
$ oc krew update
```

Example output

```terminal
Updated the local copy of plugin index.
Updated the local copy of plugin index <custom_index_name>.
New plugins available:
* ocp/<plugin_name>
```


# Adding a plugin to the CLI Manager Operator

You can add a CLI plugin to the CLI Manager Operator by creating a new plugin resource in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console&#8217;s YAML view.

* You are logged in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* The CLI Manager Operator is installed.

1. Log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.
2. Navigate to Ecosystem -> Installed Operators.
3. From the list, select CLI Manager Operator.
4. Select the CLI Plugin tab.
5. Click Create Plugin.
6. In the text box, enter the information for the plugin you are installing. See the following example YAML file.
Example YAML file to add a plugin

```yaml
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: Plugin
metadata:
  name: <plugin_name>
spec:
  description: <description_of_plugin>
  homepage: <plugin_homepage>
  platforms:
  - bin:
    files:
    - from: <plugin_file_path>
      to: .
    image: <plugin_image>
    imagePullSecret:
    platform: <platform>
  shortDescription: <short_description_of_plugin>
  version: <version>
```


where:
<plugin_name>:: Specifies the name of the plugin you plan to use in commands.
bin:: Specifies the path to the plugin executable.
imagePullSecret:: Optional field if the registry is not public to add a pull secret to access your plugin image.
<platform>:: Add the architecture for your system; for example, linux/amd64, darwin/arm64, windows/amd64, or another architecture.
<version>:: The version must be in v0.0.0 format.
7. Click Save.

* Enter the following command to see if the plugin is listed and has been added successfully:


```terminal
$ oc get plugin/<plugin_name> -o yaml
```


* Example output:


```terminal
