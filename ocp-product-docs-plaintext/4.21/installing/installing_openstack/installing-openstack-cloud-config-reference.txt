# OpenStack Cloud Controller Manager reference guide



# The OpenStack Cloud Controller Manager

Beginning with {product-title} 4.12, clusters that run on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) were switched from the legacy OpenStack cloud provider to the external OpenStack Cloud Controller Manager (CCM). This change follows the move in Kubernetes from in-tree, legacy cloud providers to external cloud providers that are implemented by using the Cloud Controller Manager.

To preserve user-defined configurations for the legacy cloud provider, existing configurations are mapped to new ones as part of the migration process. It searches for a configuration called cloud-provider-config in the openshift-config namespace.


[NOTE]
----
The config map name cloud-provider-config is not statically configured. It is derived from the spec.cloudConfig.name value in the infrastructure/cluster CRD.
----

Found configurations are synchronized to the cloud-conf config map in the openshift-cloud-controller-manager namespace.

As part of this synchronization, the OpenStack CCM Operator alters the new config map such that its properties are compatible with the external cloud provider. The file is changed in the following ways:

* The [Global] secret-name, [Global] secret-namespace, and [Global] kubeconfig-path options are removed. They do not apply to the external cloud provider.
* The [Global] use-clouds, [Global] clouds-file, and [Global] cloud options are added.
* The entire [BlockStorage] section is removed. External cloud providers no longer perform storage operations. Block storage configuration is managed by the Cinder CSI driver.

Additionally, the CCM Operator enforces a number of default options. Values for these options are always overriden as follows:


```txt
[Global]
use-clouds = true
clouds-file = /etc/openstack/secret/clouds.yaml
cloud = openstack
...

[LoadBalancer]
enabled = true
```


The clouds-value value, /etc/openstack/secret/clouds.yaml, is mapped to the openstack-cloud-credentials config in the openshift-cloud-controller-manager namespace. You can modify the RHOSP cloud in this file as you do any other clouds.yaml file.

# The OpenStack Cloud Controller Manager (CCM) config map

An OpenStack CCM config map defines how your cluster interacts with your RHOSP cloud. By default, this configuration is stored under the cloud.conf key in the cloud-conf config map in the openshift-cloud-controller-manager namespace.


[IMPORTANT]
----
The cloud-conf config map is generated from the cloud-provider-config config map in the openshift-config namespace.
To change the settings that are described by the cloud-conf config map, modify the cloud-provider-config config map.
As part of this synchronization, the CCM Operator overrides some options. For more information, see "The RHOSP Cloud Controller Manager".
----

For example:


```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  cloud.conf: |
    [Global] 1
    secret-name = openstack-credentials
    secret-namespace = kube-system
    region = regionOne
    [LoadBalancer]
    enabled = True
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2022-12-20T17:01:08Z"
  name: cloud-conf
  namespace: openshift-cloud-controller-manager
  resourceVersion: "2519"
  uid: cbbeedaf-41ed-41c2-9f37-4885732d3677
```


Set global options by using a clouds.yaml file rather than modifying the config map.

The following options are present in the config map. Except when indicated otherwise, they are mandatory for clusters that run on RHOSP.

## Load balancer options

CCM supports several load balancer options for deployments that use Octavia.


[NOTE]
----
Neutron-LBaaS support is deprecated.

## Options that the Operator overrides

The CCM Operator overrides the following options, which you might recognize from configuring RHOSP. Do not configure them yourself. They are included in this document for informational purposes only.
