# Installation configuration parameters for IBM Cloud


Before you deploy an {product-title} cluster on IBM Cloud(R), you provide parameters to customize your cluster and the platform that hosts it. When you create the install-config.yaml file, you provide values for the required parameters through the command line. You can then modify the install-config.yaml file to customize your cluster further.

# Available installation configuration parameters for IBM Cloud

The following tables specify the required, optional, and IBM Cloud-specific installation configuration parameters that you can set as part of the installation process.


[IMPORTANT]
----
After installation, you cannot change these parameters in the install-config.yaml file.

## Required configuration parameters

Required installation configuration parameters are described in the following table:



## Network configuration parameters

You can customize your installation configuration based on the requirements of your existing network infrastructure. For example, you can expand the IP address block for the cluster network or configure different IP address blocks than the defaults.

Only IPv4 addresses are supported.



## Optional configuration parameters

Optional installation configuration parameters are described in the following table:



## Additional IBM Cloud configuration parameters

Additional IBM Cloud&#174; configuration parameters are described in the following table:



1. Whether you define an existing resource group, or if the installation program creates one, determines how the resource group is treated when the cluster is uninstalled. If you define a resource group, the installation program removes all of the installer-provisioned resources, but leaves the resource group alone; if a resource group is created as part of the installation, the installation program removes all of the installer-provisioned resources and the resource group.
2. To determine which profile best meets your needs, see Instance Profiles in the IBM(R) documentation.
