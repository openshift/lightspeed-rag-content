# Installation methods


You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on IBM Cloud(R) using installer-provisioned infrastructure. This process involves using an installation program to provision the underlying infrastructure for your cluster. Installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on IBM Cloud(R) using user-provisioned infrastructure is not supported at this time.
See Installation process for more information about installer-provisioned installation processes.

# Installing a cluster on installer-provisioned infrastructure

You can install a cluster on IBM Cloud&#174; infrastructure that is provisioned by the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program by using one of the following methods:

* Installing a customized cluster on IBM Cloud(R): You can install a customized cluster on IBM Cloud(R) infrastructure that the installation program provisions. The installation program allows for some customization to be applied at the installation stage. Many other customization options are available post-installation.
* Installing a cluster on IBM Cloud(R) with network customizations: You can customize your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform network configuration during installation, so that your cluster can coexist with your existing IP address allocations and adhere to your network requirements.
* Installing a cluster on IBM Cloud(R) into an existing VPC: You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on an existing IBM Cloud(R). You can use this installation method if you have constraints set by the guidelines of your company, such as limits when creating new accounts or infrastructure.
* Installing a private cluster on an existing VPC: You can install a private cluster on an existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). You can use this method to deploy Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on an internal network that is not visible to the internet.
* Installing a cluster on IBM Cloud in a restricted network: You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on IBM Cloud on installer-provisioned infrastructure by using an internal mirror of the installation release content. You can use this method to install a cluster that does not require an active internet connection to obtain the software components.
