# Validating an installation


You can check the status of an {product-title} cluster after an installation or validate boot artifacts before an installation by following the procedures in this document.

# Validating RHCOS live media

The {product-title} installation program contains pinned versions of RHCOS bootimages. Fully automated installations use these pinned artifacts by default. The mirror registry where you downloaded the installation program contains a sha256sum encrypted with the Red&#160;Hat product key.

For user-provisioned infrastructure installations, you can access information and use the {product-title} installer to indirectly validate RHCOS bootimage artifacts using their SHA-256 checksums.

* Run the following command to print the metadata for any bootimage artifact:

```terminal
$ openshift-install coreos print-stream-json | jq <bootimage> 1
```

The query for the bootimage you want to obtain information on. For validation purposes, the bootimage artifact must have a generated sha256sum. This can include OVA, VHD, QCOW2 and others. For example, to get information on an x86_64 architecture iso file for bare metal platforms, this value would be .architectures.x86_64.artifacts.metal.formats.iso.
Example output

```text
{
  "disk": {
    "location": "<url>/art/storage/prod/streams/<release>/builds/rhcos-<release>-live.<architecture>.<artifact>",
    "sha256": "abc2add9746eb7be82e6919ec13aad8e9eae8cf073d8da6126d7c95ea0dee962"
  }
}
```


# Reviewing the installation log

You can review a summary of an installation in the {product-title} installation log. If an installation succeeds, the information required to access the cluster is included in the log.

* You have access to the installation host.

* Review the .openshift_install.log log file in the installation directory on your installation host:

```terminal
$ cat <install_dir>/.openshift_install.log
```

Example output

Cluster credentials are included at the end of the log if the installation is successful, as outlined in the following example:

```terminal
...

```


# Viewing the image pull source

For clusters with unrestricted network connectivity, you can view the source of your pulled images by using a command on a node, such as crictl images.

However, for disconnected installations, to view the source of pulled images, you must review the CRI-O logs to locate the Trying to access log entry, as shown in the following procedure. Other methods to view the image pull source, such as the crictl images command, show the non-mirrored image name, even though the image is pulled from the mirrored location.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

* Review the CRI-O logs for a master or worker node:

```terminal
$  oc adm node-logs <node_name> -u crio
```

Example output

The Trying to access log entry indicates where the image is being pulled from.

```terminal
...
Mar 17 02:52:50 ip-10-0-138-140.ec2.internal crio[1366]: time="2021-08-05 10:33:21.594930907Z" level=info msg="Pulling image: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:4.10.0-ppc64le" id=abcd713b-d0e1-4844-ac1c-474c5b60c07c name=/runtime.v1alpha2.ImageService/PullImage
Mar 17 02:52:50 ip-10-0-138-140.ec2.internal crio[1484]: time="2021-03-17 02:52:50.194341109Z" level=info msg="Trying to access \"li0317gcp1.mirror-registry.qe.gcp.devcluster.openshift.com:5000/ocp/release@sha256:1926eae7cacb9c00f142ec98b00628970e974284b6ddaf9a6a086cb9af7a6c31\""
Mar 17 02:52:50 ip-10-0-138-140.ec2.internal crio[1484]: time="2021-03-17 02:52:50.226788351Z" level=info msg="Trying to access \"li0317gcp1.mirror-registry.qe.gcp.devcluster.openshift.com:5000/ocp/release@sha256:1926eae7cacb9c00f142ec98b00628970e974284b6ddaf9a6a086cb9af7a6c31\""
...
```


The log might show the image pull source twice, as shown in the preceding example.

If your ImageContentSourcePolicy object lists multiple mirrors, {product-title} attempts to pull the images in the order listed in the configuration, for example:

```
Trying to access \"li0317gcp1.mirror-registry.qe.gcp.devcluster.openshift.com:5000/ocp/release@sha256:1926eae7cacb9c00f142ec98b00628970e974284b6ddaf9a6a086cb9af7a6c31\"
Trying to access \"li0317gcp2.mirror-registry.qe.gcp.devcluster.openshift.com:5000/ocp/release@sha256:1926eae7cacb9c00f142ec98b00628970e974284b6ddaf9a6a086cb9af7a6c31\"
```


# Getting cluster version, status, and update details

You can view the cluster version and status by running the oc get clusterversion command. If the status shows that the installation is still progressing, you can review the status of the Operators for more information.

You can also list the current update channel and review the available cluster updates.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Obtain the cluster version and overall status:

```terminal
$ oc get clusterversion
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME      VERSION   AVAILABLE   PROGRESSING   SINCE   STATUS
version   4.6.4     True        False         6m25s   Cluster version is 4.6.4
```


The example output indicates that the cluster has been installed successfully.
2. If the cluster status indicates that the installation is still progressing, you can obtain more detailed progress information by checking the status of the Operators:

```terminal
$ oc get clusteroperators.config.openshift.io
```

3. View a detailed summary of cluster specifications, update availability, and update history:

```terminal
$ oc describe clusterversion
```

4. List the current update channel:

```terminal
$ oc get clusterversion -o jsonpath='{.items[0].spec}{"\n"}'
```

Example output

```terminal
{"channel":"stable-4.6","clusterID":"245539c1-72a3-41aa-9cec-72ed8cf25c5c"}
```

5. Review the available cluster updates:

```terminal
$ oc adm upgrade
```

Example output

```terminal
Cluster version is 4.6.4

Updates:

VERSION IMAGE
4.6.6   quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release@sha256:c7e8f18e8116356701bd23ae3a23fb9892dd5ea66c8300662ef30563d7104f39
```

# Verifying that a cluster uses short-term credentials

You can verify that a cluster uses short-term security credentials for individual components by checking the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) configuration and other values in the cluster.

* You deployed an {product-title} cluster using the Cloud Credential Operator utility (ccoctl) to implement short-term credentials.
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You are logged in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

* Verify that the CCO is configured to operate in manual mode by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get cloudcredentials cluster \
  -o=jsonpath={.spec.credentialsMode}
```


The following output confirms that the CCO is operating in manual mode:
Example output

```text
Manual
```

* Verify that the cluster does not have root credentials by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get secrets \
  -n kube-system <secret_name>
```


where <secret_name> is the name of the root secret for your cloud provider.


An error confirms that the root secret is not present on the cluster.
Example output for an AWS cluster

```text
Error from server (NotFound): secrets "aws-creds" not found
```

* Verify that the components are using short-term security credentials for individual components by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get authentication cluster \
  -o jsonpath \
  --template='{ .spec.serviceAccountIssuer }'
```


This command displays the value of the .spec.serviceAccountIssuer parameter in the cluster Authentication object.
An output of a URL that is associated with your cloud provider indicates that the cluster is using manual mode with short-term credentials that are created and managed from outside of the cluster.
* Azure clusters: Verify that the components are assuming the Azure client ID that is specified in the secret manifests by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get secrets \
  -n openshift-image-registry installer-cloud-credentials \
  -o jsonpath='{.data}'
```


An output that contains the azure_client_id and azure_federated_token_file felids confirms that the components are assuming the Azure client ID.
* Azure clusters: Verify that the pod identity webhook is running by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get pods \
  -n openshift-cloud-credential-operator
```

Example output

```text
NAME                                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cloud-credential-operator-59cf744f78-r8pbq   2/2     Running   2          71m
pod-identity-webhook-548f977b4c-859lz        1/1     Running   1          70m
```


# Querying the status of the cluster nodes by using the CLI

You can verify the status of the cluster nodes after an installation.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. List the status of the cluster nodes. Verify that the output lists all of the expected control plane and compute nodes and that each node has a Ready status:

```terminal
$ oc get nodes
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                          STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
compute-1.example.com         Ready    worker   33m   v1.34.2
control-plane-1.example.com   Ready    master   41m   v1.34.2
control-plane-2.example.com   Ready    master   45m   v1.34.2
compute-2.example.com         Ready    worker   38m   v1.34.2
compute-3.example.com         Ready    worker   33m   v1.34.2
control-plane-3.example.com   Ready    master   41m   v1.34.2
```

2. Review CPU and memory resource availability for each cluster node:

```terminal
$ oc adm top nodes
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                          CPU(cores)   CPU%   MEMORY(bytes)   MEMORY%
compute-1.example.com         128m         8%     1132Mi          16%
control-plane-1.example.com   801m         22%    3471Mi          23%
control-plane-2.example.com   1718m        49%    6085Mi          40%
compute-2.example.com         935m         62%    5178Mi          75%
compute-3.example.com         111m         7%     1131Mi          16%
control-plane-3.example.com   942m         26%    4100Mi          27%
```
