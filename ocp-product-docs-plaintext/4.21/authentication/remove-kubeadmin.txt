# Removing the kubeadmin user



# The kubeadmin user

{product-title} creates a cluster administrator, kubeadmin, after the
installation process completes.

This user has the cluster-admin role automatically applied and is treated
as the root user for the cluster. The password is dynamically generated
and unique to your {product-title} environment. After installation
completes the password is provided in the installation program&#8217;s output.
For example:


```terminal
INFO Install complete!
INFO Run 'export KUBECONFIG=<your working directory>/auth/kubeconfig' to manage the cluster with 'oc', the OpenShift CLI.
INFO The cluster is ready when 'oc login -u kubeadmin -p <provided>' succeeds (wait a few minutes).
INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.demo1.openshift4-beta-abcorp.com
INFO Login to the console with user: kubeadmin, password: <provided>
```


# Removing the kubeadmin user

After you define an identity provider and create a new cluster-admin
user, you can remove the kubeadmin to improve cluster security.


[WARNING]
----
If you follow this procedure before another user is a cluster-admin,
then {product-title} must be reinstalled. It is not possible to undo
this command.
----

* You must have configured at least one identity provider.
* You must have added the cluster-admin role to a user.
* You must be logged in as an administrator.

* Remove the kubeadmin secrets:

```terminal
$ oc delete secrets kubeadmin -n kube-system
```
