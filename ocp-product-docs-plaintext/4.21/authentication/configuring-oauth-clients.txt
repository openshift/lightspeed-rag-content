# Configuring OAuth clients


Several OAuth clients are created by default in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. You can also register and configure additional OAuth clients.

# Default OAuth clients

The following OAuth clients are automatically created when starting the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform API:



1. <namespace_route> refers to the namespace route. This is found by
running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get route oauth-openshift -n openshift-authentication -o json | jq .spec.host
```

# Registering an additional OAuth client

If you need an additional OAuth client to manage authentication for your
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, you can register one.

* To register additional OAuth clients:

```terminal
$ oc create -f <(echo '
kind: OAuthClient
apiVersion: oauth.openshift.io/v1
metadata:
 name: demo 1
secret: "..." 2
redirectURIs:
 - "http://www.example.com/" 3
grantMethod: prompt 4
')
```

The name of the OAuth client is used as the client_id parameter when
making requests to <namespace_route>/oauth/authorize and
<namespace_route>/oauth/token.
The secret is used as the client_secret parameter when making requests
to <namespace_route>/oauth/token.
The redirect_uri parameter specified in requests to
<namespace_route>/oauth/authorize and <namespace_route>/oauth/token
 must be equal to or prefixed by one of the URIs listed in the
redirectURIs parameter value.
The grantMethod is used to determine what action to take when this
client requests tokens and has not yet been granted access by the user.
Specify auto to automatically approve the grant and retry the request,
or prompt to prompt the user to approve or deny the grant.

# Configuring token inactivity timeout for an OAuth client

You can configure OAuth clients to expire OAuth tokens after a set period of inactivity. By default, no token inactivity timeout is set.


[NOTE]
----
If the token inactivity timeout is also configured in the internal OAuth server configuration, the timeout that is set in the OAuth client overrides that value.
----

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You have configured an identity provider (IDP).

* Update the OAuthClient configuration to set a token inactivity timeout.
1. Edit the OAuthClient object:

```terminal
$ oc edit oauthclient <oauth_client> 1
```

Replace <oauth_client> with the OAuth client to configure, for example, console.

Add the accessTokenInactivityTimeoutSeconds field and set your timeout value:

```yaml
apiVersion: oauth.openshift.io/v1
grantMethod: auto
kind: OAuthClient
metadata:
...
accessTokenInactivityTimeoutSeconds: 600 1
```

The minimum allowed timeout value in seconds is 300.
2. Save the file to apply the changes.

1. Log in to the cluster with an identity from your IDP. Be sure to use the OAuth client that you just configured.
2. Perform an action and verify that it was successful.
3. Wait longer than the configured timeout without using the identity. In this procedure's example, wait longer than 600 seconds.
4. Try to perform an action from the same identity's session.

This attempt should fail because the token should have expired due to inactivity longer than the configured timeout.
