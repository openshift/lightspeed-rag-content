# Manual mode with short-term credentials for components


During installation, you can configure the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) to operate in manual mode and use the CCO utility (ccoctl) to implement short-term security credentials for individual components that are created and managed outside the {product-title} cluster.

[NOTE]
----
This credentials strategy is supported for Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, and global Microsoft Azure only.
For AWS and Google Cloud clusters, you must configure your cluster to use this strategy during installation of a new {product-title} cluster.
You cannot configure an existing AWS or Google Cloud cluster that uses a different credentials strategy to use this feature.
If you did not configure your Azure cluster to use Microsoft Entra Workload ID during installation, you can enable this authentication method on an existing cluster.
----
Cloud providers use different terms for their implementation of this authentication method.

# AWS Security Token Service

In manual mode with Security Token Service (STS), the individual {product-title} cluster components use the AWS STS to assign components IAM roles that provide short-term, limited-privilege security credentials. These credentials are associated with IAM roles that are specific to each component that makes AWS API calls.

* Configuring an AWS cluster to use short-term credentials

## AWS Security Token Service authentication process

The AWS Security Token Service (STS) and the AssumeRole API action allow pods to retrieve access keys that are defined by an IAM role policy.

The {product-title} cluster includes a Kubernetes service account signing service. This service uses a private key to sign service account JSON web tokens (JWT). A pod that requires a service account token requests one through the pod specification. When the pod is created and assigned to a node, the node retrieves a signed service account from the service account signing service and mounts it onto the pod.

Clusters that use STS contain an IAM role ID in their Kubernetes configuration secrets. Workloads assume the identity of this IAM role ID. The signed service account token issued to the workload aligns with the configuration in AWS, which allows AWS STS to grant access keys for the specified IAM role to the workload.

AWS STS grants access keys only for requests that include service account tokens that meet the following conditions:

* The token name and namespace match the service account name and namespace.
* The token is signed by a key that matches the public key.

The public key pair for the service account signing key used by the cluster is stored in an AWS S3 bucket. AWS STS federation validates that the service account token signature aligns with the public key stored in the S3 bucket.

### Authentication flow for AWS STS

The following diagram illustrates the authentication flow between AWS and the {product-title} cluster when using AWS STS.

* Token signing is the Kubernetes service account signing service on the {product-title} cluster.
* The Kubernetes service account in the pod is the signed service account token.

![Detailed authentication flow between AWS and the cluster when using AWS STS]

Requests for new and refreshed credentials are automated by using an appropriately configured AWS IAM OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider combined with AWS IAM roles. Service account tokens that are trusted by AWS IAM are signed by {product-title} and can be projected into a pod and used for authentication.

### Token refreshing for AWS STS

The signed service account token that a pod uses expires after a period of time. For clusters that use AWS STS, this time period is 3600 seconds, or one hour.

The kubelet on the node that the pod is assigned to ensures that the token is refreshed. The kubelet attempts to rotate a token when it is older than 80 percent of its time to live.

### OpenID Connect requirements for AWS STS

You can store the public portion of the encryption keys for your OIDC configuration in a public or private S3 bucket.

The OIDC spec requires the use of HTTPS. AWS services require a public endpoint to expose the OIDC documents in the form of JSON web key set (JWKS) public keys. This allows AWS services to validate the bound tokens signed by Kubernetes and determine whether to trust certificates. As a result, both S3 bucket options require a public HTTPS endpoint and private endpoints are not supported.

To use AWS STS, the public AWS backbone for the AWS STS service must be able to communicate with a public S3 bucket or a private S3 bucket with a public CloudFront endpoint. You can choose which type of bucket to use when you process CredentialsRequest objects during installation:

* By default, the CCO utility (ccoctl) stores the OIDC configuration files in a public S3 bucket and uses the S3 URL as the public OIDC endpoint.
* As an alternative, you can have the ccoctl utility store the OIDC configuration in a private S3 bucket that is accessed by the IAM identity provider through a public CloudFront distribution URL.

## AWS component secret formats

Using manual mode with the AWS Security Token Service (STS) changes the content of the AWS credentials that are provided to individual {product-title} components. Compare the following secret formats:


```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  namespace: <target_namespace> 1
  name: <target_secret_name> 2
data:
  aws_access_key_id: <base64_encoded_access_key_id>
  aws_secret_access_key: <base64_encoded_secret_access_key>
```


The namespace for the component.
The name of the component secret.


```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  namespace: <target_namespace> 1
  name: <target_secret_name> 2
stringData:
  credentials: |-
    [default]
    sts_regional_endpoints = regional
    role_name: <operator_role_name> 3
    web_identity_token_file: <path_to_token> 4
```


The namespace for the component.
The name of the component secret.
The IAM role for the component.
The path to the service account token inside the pod. By convention, this is /var/run/secrets/openshift/serviceaccount/token for {product-title} components.

## AWS component secret permissions requirements

{product-title} components require the following permissions. These values are in the CredentialsRequest custom resource (CR) for each component.


[NOTE]
----
These permissions apply to all resources. Unless specified, there are no request conditions on these permissions.

1. Request condition: kms:GrantIsForAWSResource: true

## OLM-managed Operator support for authentication with AWS STS

Certain Operators managed by the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) on AWS clusters can use manual mode with STS.
These Operators authenticate with limited-privilege, short-term credentials that are managed outside the cluster.
To determine if an Operator supports authentication with AWS STS, see the Operator description in the software catalog.

* CCO-based workflow for OLM-managed Operators with AWS STS

# GCP Workload Identity

In manual mode with GCP Workload Identity, the individual {product-title} cluster components use the Google Cloud workload identity provider to allow components to impersonate Google Cloud service accounts using short-term, limited-privilege credentials.

* Configuring a Google Cloud cluster to use short-term credentials

## Google Cloud Workload Identity authentication process

Requests for new and refreshed credentials are automated by using an appropriately configured OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider combined with IAM service accounts. Service account tokens that are trusted by Google Cloud are signed by {product-title} and can be projected into a pod and used for authentication. Tokens are refreshed after one hour.

The following diagram details the authentication flow between Google Cloud and the {product-title} cluster when using Google Cloud Workload Identity.
