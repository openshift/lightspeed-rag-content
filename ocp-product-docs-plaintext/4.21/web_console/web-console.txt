# Accessing the web console


The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console is a user interface accessible from a web browser. You can use the web console to visualize, browse, and manage the contents of projects.

# Prerequisites

* You must use one of the following supported web browsers: Edge, Chrome, Safari, or Mozilla Firefox. IE 11 and earlier is not supported.
* Review the OpenShift ContainerPlatform 4.x Tested Integrations page before you create the supporting infrastructure for your cluster.

# Understanding and accessing the web console

The web console runs as a pod on the control plane node. The static assets required to run the web console are served by the pod.

After you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform using the openshift-install create cluster command, you can find the web console URL and login credentials for the installed cluster in the CLI output of the installation program. For example:


```terminal
**Example output**:
----
INFO Install complete!
INFO Run 'export KUBECONFIG=<your working directory>/auth/kubeconfig' to manage the cluster with 'oc', the OpenShift CLI.
INFO The cluster is ready when 'oc login -u kubeadmin -p <provided>' succeeds (wait a few minutes).
INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.demo1.openshift4-beta-abcorp.com
INFO Login to the console with user: kubeadmin, password: <provided>
----
```


Use those details to log in and access the web console.

For existing clusters that you did not install, you can use oc whoami --show-console to see the web console URL.


[IMPORTANT]
----
The dir parameter specifies the assets directory, which stores the manifest files, the ISO image, and the auth directory. The auth directory stores the kubeadmin-password and kubeconfig files. As a kubeadmin user, you can use the kubeconfig file to access the cluster with the following setting: export KUBECONFIG=<install_directory>/auth/kubeconfig. The kubeconfig is specific to the generated ISO image, so if the kubeconfig is set and the oc command fails, it is possible that the system did not boot with the generated ISO image. To perform debugging, during the bootstrap process, you can log in to the console as the core user by using the contents of the kubeadmin-password file.
