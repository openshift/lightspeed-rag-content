# Managing cluster extensions


You use catalogs to access the versions, patches, and over-the-air updates for extensions and Operators. You use custom resources (CRs) to manage extensions declaratively from the CLI.

[NOTE]
----
For Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.21, documented procedures for OLM v1 are CLI-based only. Alternatively, administrators can create and view related objects in the web console by using normal methods, such as the Import YAML and Search pages. However, the existing Software Catalog and Installed Operators pages do not yet display OLM v1 components.
----

# Finding Operators to install from a catalog

After you add a catalog to your cluster, you can query the catalog to find Operators and extensions to install.

Currently in Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) v1, you cannot query on-cluster catalogs managed by catalogd. In OLM v1, you must use the opm and jq CLI tools to query the catalog registry.

* You have added a catalog to your cluster.
* You have installed the jq CLI tool.
* You have installed the opm CLI tool.

1. To return a list of extensions that support the AllNamespaces install mode and do not use webhooks, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ opm render <catalog_registry_url>:<tag> \
  | jq -cs '[.[] | select(.schema == "olm.bundle" \
  and (.properties[] | select(.type == "olm.csv.metadata").value.installModes[] \
  | select(.type == "AllNamespaces" and .supported == true)) \
  and .spec.webhookdefinitions == null) | .package] | unique[]'
```


where:
catalog_registry_url:: Specifies the URL of the catalog registry, such as registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index.
tag:: Specifies the tag or version of the catalog, such as v4.21 or latest.
Example command

```terminal
$ opm render \
  registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.21 \
  | jq -cs '[.[] | select(.schema == "olm.bundle" \
  and (.properties[] | select(.type == "olm.csv.metadata").value.installModes[] \
  | select(.type == "AllNamespaces" and .supported == true)) \
  and .spec.webhookdefinitions == null) | .package] | unique[]'
```
Example output

```text
"3scale-operator"
"amq-broker-rhel8"
"amq-online"
"amq-streams"
"amq-streams-console"
"ansible-automation-platform-operator"
"ansible-cloud-addons-operator"
"apicast-operator"
"authorino-operator"
"aws-load-balancer-operator"
"bamoe-kogito-operator"
"cephcsi-operator"
"cincinnati-operator"
"cluster-logging"
"cluster-observability-operator"
"compliance-operator"
"container-security-operator"
"cryostat-operator"
"datagrid"
"devspaces"
...
```
2. Inspect the contents of an extension's metadata by running the following command:

```terminal
$ opm render <catalog_registry_url>:<tag> \
  | jq -s '.[] | select( .schema == "olm.package") \
  | select( .name == "<package_name>")'
```

Example command

```terminal
$ opm render \
  registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.21 \
  | jq -s '.[] | select( .schema == "olm.package") \
  | select( .name == "openshift-pipelines-operator-rh")'
```
Example output

```text
{
  "schema": "olm.package",
  "name": "openshift-pipelines-operator-rh",
  "defaultChannel": "latest",
  "icon": {
    "base64data": "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhE...",
    "mediatype": "image/png"
  }
}
```

## Common catalog queries

You can query catalogs by using the opm and jq CLI tools. The following tables show common catalog queries that you can use when installing, updating, and managing the lifecycle of extensions.


```terminal
$ opm render <catalog_registry_url>:<tag> | <jq_request>
```


where:

catalog_registry_url:: Specifies the URL of the catalog registry, such as registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index.
tag:: Specifies the tag or version of the catalog, such as v4.21 or latest.
jq_request:: Specifies the query you want to run on the catalog.


```terminal
$ opm render \
  registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.21 \
  | jq -cs '[.[] | select(.schema == "olm.bundle" and (.properties[] \
  | select(.type == "olm.csv.metadata").value.installModes[] \
  | select(.type == "AllNamespaces" and .supported == true)) \
  and .spec.webhookdefinitions == null) \
  | .package] | unique[]'
```







# Cluster extension permissions

In Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) Classic, a single service account with cluster administrator privileges manages all cluster extensions.

OLM v1 is designed to be more secure than OLM (Classic) by default. OLM v1 manages a cluster extension by using the service account specified in an extension&#8217;s custom resource (CR). Cluster administrators can create a service account for each cluster extension. As a result, administrators can follow the principle of least privilege and assign only the role-based access controls (RBAC) to install and manage that extension.

You must add each permission to either a cluster role or role. Then you must bind the cluster role or role to the service account with a cluster role binding or role binding.

You can scope the RBAC to either the cluster or to a namespace. Use cluster roles and cluster role bindings to scope permissions to the cluster. Use roles and role bindings to scope permissions to a namespace. Whether you scope the permissions to the cluster or to a namespace depends on the design of the extension you want to install and manage.


[IMPORTANT]
----
To simply the following procedure and improve readability, the following example manifest uses permissions that are scoped to the cluster. You can further restrict some of the permissions by scoping them to the namespace of the extension instead of the cluster.
----

If a new version of an installed extension requires additional permissions, OLM v1 halts the update process until a cluster administrator grants those permissions.

## Creating a namespace

Before you create a service account to install and manage your cluster extension, you must create a namespace.

* Access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster using an account with cluster-admin permissions.

* Create a new namespace for the service account of the extension that you want to install by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc adm new-project <new_namespace>
```


## Creating a service account for an extension

You must create a service account to install, manage, and update a cluster extension.

* Access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster using an account with cluster-admin permissions.

1. Create a service account, similar to the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: <extension>-installer
  namespace: <namespace>
```

Example extension-service-account.yaml file

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: pipelines-installer
  namespace: pipelines
```
2. Apply the service account by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f extension-service-account.yaml
```


## Downloading the bundle manifests of an extension

Use the opm CLI tool to download the bundle manifests of the extension that you want to install. Use the CLI tool or text editor of your choice to view the manifests and find the required permissions to install and manage the extension.

* You have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster using an account with cluster-admin permissions.
* You have decided which extension you want to install.
* You have installed the opm CLI tool.

1. Inspect the available versions and images of the extension you want to install by running the following command:

```terminal
$ opm render <registry_url>:<tag_or_version> | \
  jq -cs '.[] | select( .schema == "olm.bundle" ) | \
  select( .package == "<extension_name>") | \
  {"name":.name, "image":.image}'
```

Example command

```terminal
$ opm render registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.21 | \
  jq -cs '.[] | select( .schema == "olm.bundle" ) | \
  select( .package == "openshift-pipelines-operator-rh") | \
  {"name":.name, "image":.image}'
```
Example output

```text

```
2. Make a directory to extract the image of the bundle that you want to install by running the following command:

```terminal
$ mkdir <new_dir>
```

3. Change into the directory by running the following command:

```terminal
$ cd <new_dir>
```

4. Find the image reference of the version that you want to install and run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc image extract <full_path_to_registry_image>@sha256:<sha>
```

Example command

```terminal
$ oc image extract registry.redhat.io/openshift-pipelines/pipelines-operator-bundle@sha256:f7b19ce26be742c4aaa458d37bc5ad373b5b29b20aaa7d308349687d3cbd8838
```

5. Change into the manifests directory by running the following command:

```terminal
$ cd manifests
```

6. View the contents of the manifests directory by entering the following command. The output lists the manifests of the resources required to install, manage, and operate your extension.

```terminal
$ tree
```

* View the contents of the install.spec.clusterpermissions stanza of cluster service version (CSV) file in the manifests directory using your preferred CLI tool or text editor. The following examples reference the openshift-pipelines-operator-rh.clusterserviceversion.yaml file of the Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines Operator.
* Keep this file open as a reference while assigning permissions to the cluster role file in the following procedure.

## Required permissions to install and manage a cluster extension

You must inspect the manifests included in the bundle image of a cluster extension to assign the necessary permissions. The service account requires enough role-based access controls (RBAC) to create and manage the following resources.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Follow the principle of least privilege and scope permissions to specific resource names with the least RBAC required to run.
----

Admission plugins:: Because Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters use the OwnerReferencesPermissionEnforcement admission plugin, cluster extensions must have permissions to update the blockOwnerDeletion and ownerReferences finalizers.
Cluster role and cluster role bindings for the controllers of the extension:: You must define RBAC so that the installation service account can create and manage cluster roles and cluster role bindings for the extension controllers.
Cluster service version (CSV):: You must define RBAC for the resources defined in the CSV of the cluster extension.
Cluster-scoped bundle resources:: You must define RBAC to create and manage any cluster-scoped resources included in the bundle. If the cluster-scoped resources matches another resource type, such as a ClusterRole, you can add the resource to the pre-existing rule under the resources or resourceNames field.
Custom resource definitions (CRDs):: You must define RBAC so that the installation service account can create and manage the CRDs for the extension. Also, you must grant the service account for the controller of the extension the RBAC to manage its CRDs.
Deployments:: You must define RBAC for the installation service account to create and manage the deployments needed by the extension controller, such as services and config maps.
Extension permissions:: You must include RBAC for the permissions and cluster permissions defined in the CSV. The installation service account needs the ability to grant these permissions to the extension controller, which needs these permissions to run.
Namespace-scoped bundle resources:: You must define RBAC for any namespace-scoped bundle resources. The installation service account requires permission to create and manage resources, such as config maps or services.
Roles and role bindings:: You must define RBAC for any roles or role bindings defined in the CSV. The installation service account needs permission to create and manage those roles and role bindings.

Service accounts:: You must define RBAC so that the installation service account can create and manage the service accounts for the extension controllers.

## Creating a cluster role for an extension

You must review the install.spec.clusterpermissions stanza of the cluster service version (CSV) and the manifests of an extension carefully to define the required role-based access controls (RBAC) of the extension that you want to install. You must create a cluster role by copying the required RBAC from the CSV to the new manifest.


[TIP]
----
If you want to test the process for installing and updating an extension in OLM v1, you can use the following cluster role to grant cluster administrator permissions. This manifest is for testing purposes only. It should not be used in production clusters.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: <extension>-installer-clusterrole
rules:
- apiGroups: ["*"]
  resources: ["*"]
  verbs: ["*"]
```

----

The following procedure uses the openshift-pipelines-operator-rh.clusterserviceversion.yaml file of the Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines Operator as an example. The examples include excerpts of the RBAC required to install and manage the OpenShift Pipelines Operator. For a complete manifest, see "Example cluster role for the Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines Operator".


[IMPORTANT]
----
To simply the following procedure and improve readability, the following example manifest uses permissions that are scoped to the cluster. You can further restrict some of the permissions by scoping them to the namespace of the extension instead of the cluster.
----

* Access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster using an account with cluster-admin permissions.
* You have downloaded the manifests in the image reference of the extension that you want to install.

1. Create a new cluster role manifest, similar to the following example:
Example <extension>-cluster-role.yaml file

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: <extension>-installer-clusterrole
```

2. Edit your cluster role manifest to include permission to update finalizers on the extension, similar to the following example:
Example <extension>-cluster-role.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: pipelines-installer-clusterrole
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - olm.operatorframework.io
  resources:
  - clusterextensions/finalizers
  verbs:
  - update
  # Scoped to the name of the ClusterExtension
  resourceNames:
  - <metadata_name> 1
```

Specifies the value from the metadata.name field from the custom resource (CR) of the extension.
3. Search for the clusterrole and clusterrolebindings values in the rules.resources field in the extension's CSV file.
* Copy the API groups, resources, verbs, and resource names to your manifest, similar to the following example:
Example cluster role manifest

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: pipelines-installer-clusterrole
rules:
# ...
# ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings for the controllers of the extension
- apiGroups:
  - rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  resources:
  - clusterroles
  verbs:
  - create 1
  - list
  - watch
- apiGroups:
  - rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  resources:
  - clusterroles
  verbs:
  - get
  - update
  - patch
  - delete
  resourceNames: 2
  - "*"
- apiGroups:
  - rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  resources:
  - clusterrolebindings
  verbs:
  - create
  - list
  - watch
- apiGroups:
  - rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  resources:
  - clusterrolebindings
  verbs:
  - get
  - update
  - patch
  - delete
  resourceNames:
  - "*"
# ...
```

You cannot scope create, list, and watch permissions to specific resource names (the resourceNames field). You must scope these permissions to their resources (the resources field).
Some resource names are generated by using the following format: <package_name>.<hash>. After you install the extension, look up the resource names for the cluster roles and cluster role bindings for the controller of the extension. Replace the wildcard characters in this example with the generated names and follow the principle of least privilege.
4. Search for the customresourcedefinitions value in the rules.resources field in the extension's CSV file.
* Copy the API groups, resources, verbs, and resource names to your manifest, similar to the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: pipelines-installer-clusterrole
rules:
# ...
# Custom resource definitions of the extension
- apiGroups:
  - apiextensions.k8s.io
  resources:
  - customresourcedefinitions
  verbs:
  - create
  - list
  - watch
- apiGroups:
  - apiextensions.k8s.io
  resources:
  - customresourcedefinitions
  verbs:
  - get
  - update
  - patch
  - delete
  resourceNames:
  - manualapprovalgates.operator.tekton.dev
  - openshiftpipelinesascodes.operator.tekton.dev
  - tektonaddons.operator.tekton.dev
  - tektonchains.operator.tekton.dev
  - tektonconfigs.operator.tekton.dev
  - tektonhubs.operator.tekton.dev
  - tektoninstallersets.operator.tekton.dev
  - tektonpipelines.operator.tekton.dev
  - tektonresults.operator.tekton.dev
  - tektontriggers.operator.tekton.dev
# ...
```

5. Search the CSV file for stanzas with the permissions and clusterPermissions values in the rules.resources spec.
* Copy the API groups, resources, verbs, and resource names to your manifest, similar to the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: pipelines-installer-clusterrole
rules:
# ...
# Excerpt from install.spec.clusterPermissions
- apiGroups:
  - ''
  resources:
  - nodes
  - pods
  - services
  - endpoints
  - persistentvolumeclaims
  - events
  - configmaps
  - secrets
  - pods/log
  - limitranges
  verbs:
  - create
  - list
  - watch
  - delete
  - deletecollection
  - patch
  - get
  - update
- apiGroups:
  - extensions
  - apps
  resources:
  - ingresses
  - ingresses/status
  verbs:
  - create
  - list
  - watch
  - delete
  - patch
  - get
  - update
 # ...
```

6. Search the CSV file for resources under the install.spec.deployments stanza.
* Copy the API groups, resources, verbs, and resource names to your manifest, similar to the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: pipelines-installer-clusterrole
rules:
# ...
# Excerpt from install.spec.deployments
- apiGroups:

  resources:
  - deployments
  verbs:
  - get
  - update
  - patch
  - delete
  # scoped to the extension controller deployment name
  resourceNames:
  - openshift-pipelines-operator
  - tekton-operator-webhook
# ...
```

7. Search for the services and configmaps values in the rules.resources field in the extension's CSV file.
* Copy the API groups, resources, verbs, and resource names to your manifest, similar to the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: pipelines-installer-clusterrole
rules:
# ...
# Services
- apiGroups:

- apiGroups:
  - ""
  resources:
  - configmaps
  verbs:
  - get
  - list
  - watch
  - update
  - patch
  - delete
  # scoped to the configmap name
  resourceNames:
  - config-logging
  - tekton-config-defaults
  - tekton-config-observability
  - tekton-operator-controller-config-leader-election
  - tekton-operator-info
  - tekton-operator-webhook-config-leader-election

  - operator.tekton.dev
  resources:
  - tekton-config-read-role
  - tekton-result-read-role
  verbs:
  - get
  - watch
  - list
```

8. Add the cluster role manifest to the cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <extension>-installer-clusterrole.yaml
```

Example command

```terminal
$ oc apply -f pipelines-installer-clusterrole.yaml
```

## Creating a cluster role binding for an extension

After you have created a service account and cluster role, you must bind the cluster role to the service account with a cluster role binding manifest.

* Access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster using an account with cluster-admin permissions.
* You have created and applied the following resources for the extension you want to install:
* Namespace
* Service account
* Cluster role

1. Create a cluster role binding to bind the cluster role to the service account, similar to the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: <extension>-installer-binding
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: <extension>-installer-clusterrole
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: <extension>-installer
  namespace: <namespace>
```

Example pipelines-cluster-role-binding.yaml file

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: pipelines-installer-binding
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: pipelines-installer-clusterrole
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: pipelines-installer
  namespace: pipelines
```
2. Apply the cluster role binding by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f pipelines-cluster-role-binding.yaml
```


# Installing a cluster extension in all namespaces

You can install an extension from a catalog by creating a custom resource (CR) and applying it to the cluster. Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) v1 supports installing cluster extensions, including OLM (Classic) Operators in the registry+v1 bundle format, that are scoped to the cluster. For more information, see Supported extensions.


[NOTE]
----
For Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.21, documented procedures for OLM v1 are CLI-based only. Alternatively, administrators can create and view related objects in the web console by using normal methods, such as the Import YAML and Search pages. However, the existing Software Catalog and Installed Operators pages do not yet display OLM v1 components.
----

* You have created a service account and assigned enough role-based access controls (RBAC) to install, update, and manage the extension that you want to install. For more information, see "Cluster extension permissions".

1. Create a CR, similar to the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: olm.operatorframework.io/v1
  kind: ClusterExtension
  metadata:
    name: <clusterextension_name>
  spec:
    namespace: <installed_namespace> 1
    serviceAccount:
      name: <service_account_installer_name> 2
    source:
      sourceType: Catalog
      catalog:
        packageName: <package_name>
        channels:
          - <channel_name> 3
        version: <version_or_version_range> 4
        upgradeConstraintPolicy: CatalogProvided 5
```

Specifies the namespace where you want the bundle installed, such as pipelines or my-extension. Extensions are still cluster-scoped and might contain resources that are installed in different namespaces.
Specifies the name of the service account you created to install, update, and manage your extension.
Optional: Specifies channel names as an array, such as pipelines-1.14 or latest.
Optional: Specifies the version or version range, such as 1.14.0, 1.14.x, or >=1.16, of the package you want to install or update. For more information, see "Example custom resources (CRs) that specify a target version" and "Support for version ranges".
Optional: Specifies the upgrade constraint policy. If unspecified, the default setting is CatalogProvided. The CatalogProvided setting only updates if the new version satisfies the upgrade constraints set by the package author. To force an update or rollback, set the field to SelfCertified. For more information, see "Forcing an update or rollback".


```yaml
apiVersion: olm.operatorframework.io/v1
kind: ClusterExtension
metadata:
  name: pipelines-operator
spec:
  namespace: pipelines
  serviceAccount:
    name: pipelines-installer
  source:
    sourceType: Catalog
    catalog:
      packageName: openshift-pipelines-operator-rh
      version: "1.14.x"
```


1. Apply the CR to the cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f pipeline-operator.yaml
```

Example output

```text
clusterextension.olm.operatorframework.io/pipelines-operator created
```


1. View the Operator or extension's CR in the YAML format by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get clusterextension pipelines-operator -o yaml
```

Example output

# Configuring a watch namespace for a cluster extension (Technology Preview)

You can configure the watch namespace for extensions that support namespace-scoped resource watching.


[IMPORTANT]
----
{FeatureName} is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
----

* You have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster using an account with cluster-admin permissions.
* You have enabled the TechPreviewNoUpgrade feature set on the cluster.
* You have created a service account and assigned enough role-based access controls (RBAC) to install, update, and manage the extension. For more information, see "Cluster extension permissions".
* You have verified the supported install modes for the extension and determined the required watchNamespace configuration.

1. Create a custom resource (CR) based on where you want the extension to watch for resources:
* To configure the extension to watch its own installation namespace:

```yaml
apiVersion: olm.operatorframework.io/v1
kind: ClusterExtension
metadata:
  name: <extension_name>
spec:
  namespace: <installation_namespace>
  config:
    configType: Inline
    inline:
      watchNamespace: <installation_namespace>
  serviceAccount:
    name: <service_account>
  source:
    sourceType: Catalog
    catalog:
      packageName: <package_name>
      version: <version>
      upgradeConstraintPolicy: CatalogProvided
```


where:
config.inline.watchNamespace:: Specifies the namespace to watch for resources. For requirements and valid values, see "Extension configuration".
* To configure the extension to watch a different namespace:

```yaml
apiVersion: olm.operatorframework.io/v1
kind: ClusterExtension
metadata:
  name: <extension_name>
spec:
  namespace: <installation_namespace>
  config:
    configType: Inline
    inline:
      watchNamespace: <watched_namespace>
  serviceAccount:
    name: <service_account>
  source:
    sourceType: Catalog
    catalog:
      packageName: <package_name>
      version: <version>
      upgradeConstraintPolicy: CatalogProvided
```

2. Apply the CR to the cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <cluster_extension_cr>.yaml
```


* Verify that the extension installed successfully by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get clusterextension <extension_name> -o yaml
```

Example output

```yaml
apiVersion: olm.operatorframework.io/v1
kind: ClusterExtension
metadata:
  name: <extension_name>
spec:
  namespace: <installation_namespace>
  config:
    configType: Inline
    inline:
      watchNamespace: <installation_namespace>
status:
  conditions:
  - type: Installed
    status: "True"
    reason: Succeeded
```


* Supported extensions
* Projects and namespaces
* Creating a service account
* Example custom resources (CRs) that specify a target version
* Support for version ranges

# Preflight permissions check for cluster extensions (Technology Preview)

When you try to install an extension, the Operator Controller performs a dry run of the installation process. This dry run verifies that the specified service account can perform all the actions required to install the extension. This includes creating all the Kubernetes objects in the bundle and the role-based access control (RBAC) rules for the roles and bindings defined by the bundle.


[IMPORTANT]
----
{FeatureName} is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
----

If the service account is missing any required RBAC rules, the preflight check fails before the actual installation proceeds. If the preflight check fails, the Operator Controller reports the errors in the status conditions of the extension and in the logs of the Operator Controller.

To proceed with the installation, update the roles and bindings to grant the missing permissions to the service account and apply the changes. If there are no errors, the Operator Controller reconciles the updated permissions and completes the installation.

## Example report from the preflight permissions check

The following report indicates that the service account requires the following missing permissions:

* RBAC rules to perform list and watch actions for the services resource in the core API group for the entire cluster
* RBAC rules to perform create actions for deployments resources in the apps API group for the pipelines namespace

You can access the reports from the preflight permissions check in the status conditions of the cluster extension. The oc describe clusterextension command prints information about a cluster extension, including the status conditions.


```terminal
$ oc describe clusterextension <extension_name>
```



```text
apiVersion: v1
items:
- apiVersion: olm.operatorframework.io/v1
  kind: ClusterExtension
...
Conditions:
  Type:    Progressing
  Status:  False
  Reason:  Retrying
  Message: pre-authorization failed: service account requires the following permissions to manage cluster extension:
           Namespace:"" APIGroups:[] Resources:[services] Verbs:[list,watch]
           Namespace:"pipelines" APIGroups:["apps"] Resources:[deployments] Verbs:[create]
```


Namespace:: Specifies the scope of the required RBAC rules at the namespace level, for example the pipelines namespace. An empty namespace value, "", indicates that you must scope the permission to the cluster.
APIGroups:: Specifies the name of the API group the required permissions apply to. An empty value in the API group, [], indicates the permissions apply to the core API group. For example, services, secrets, and config maps are all core resources.

If a resource belongs to a named API group, the report lists the name in between the brackets. For example, the value of APIGroups:[apps] indicates the extension requires RBAC rules to act on resources in the apps API group.
Resources:: Specifies the resource types that require permissions. For example, services, secrets, and custom resource definitions are common resource types.
Verbs:: Specifies the actions, or verbs, that the service account needs permission to perform. If the report lists several verbs, all of the listed verbs require RBAC rules.

## Common permission errors

Missing verbs:: The service account does not have permission to perform a required action. To resolve this issue, update or create a role and binding to grant the necessary permissions. Roles and role bindings define resource permissions for a namespace. Cluster roles and cluster role bindings define resource permissions for the cluster.
Privilege escalation:: The service account does not have enough permission to create a role or cluster role that the extension needs. When this happens, the preflight check reports the verbs as missing to prevent privilege escalation. To resolve this issue, grant enough permission to the service account so that it can create the roles.
Missing role references:: The extension references a role or cluster role that the Operator Controller cannot find. When this happens, the preflight check lists the missing role and reports an authorization evalutation error. To resolve the issue, create or update the roles and cluster roles to ensure that all role references exist.

# Updating a cluster extension

You can update your cluster extension or Operator by manually editing the custom resource (CR) and applying the changes.

* You have an Operator or extension installed.
* You have installed the jq CLI tool.
* You have installed the opm CLI tool.

1. Inspect a package for channel and version information from a local copy of your catalog file by completing the following steps:
1. Get a list of channels from a selected package by running the following command:

```terminal
$ opm render <catalog_registry_url>:<tag> \
  | jq -s '.[] | select( .schema == "olm.channel" ) \
  | select( .package == "openshift-pipelines-operator-rh") | .name'
```

Example command

```terminal
$ opm render registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.21 \
  | jq -s '.[] | select( .schema == "olm.channel" ) \
  | select( .package == "openshift-pipelines-operator-rh") | .name'
```
Example output

```text
"latest"
"pipelines-1.14"
"pipelines-1.15"
"pipelines-1.16"
"pipelines-1.17"
```
2. Get a list of the versions published in a channel by running the following command:

```terminal
$ opm render <catalog_registry_url>:<tag> \
  | jq -s '.[] | select( .package == "<package_name>" ) \
  | select( .schema == "olm.channel" ) \
  | select( .name == "<channel_name>" ) | .entries \
  | .[] | .name'
```

Example command

```terminal
$ opm render registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.21 \
  | jq -s '.[] | select( .package == "openshift-pipelines-operator-rh" ) \
  | select( .schema == "olm.channel" ) | select( .name == "latest" ) \
  | .entries | .[] | .name'
```
Example output

```text
"openshift-pipelines-operator-rh.v1.15.0"
"openshift-pipelines-operator-rh.v1.16.0"
"openshift-pipelines-operator-rh.v1.17.0"
"openshift-pipelines-operator-rh.v1.17.1"
```
2. Find out what version or channel is specified in your Operator or extension's CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get clusterextension <operator_name> -o yaml
```

Example command

```terminal
$ oc get clusterextension pipelines-operator -o yaml
```

Example output

```text

3. Edit your CR by using one of the following methods:
* If you want to pin your Operator or extension to specific version, such as 1.15.0, edit your CR similar to the following example:
Example pipelines-operator.yaml CR

```yaml
apiVersion: olm.operatorframework.io/v1
kind: ClusterExtension
metadata:
  name: pipelines-operator
spec:
  namespace: pipelines
  serviceAccount:
    name: pipelines-installer
  source:
    sourceType: Catalog
    catalog:
      packageName: openshift-pipelines-operator-rh
      version: "1.15.0" 1
```

Update the version from 1.14.x to 1.15.0
* If you want to define a range of acceptable update versions, edit your CR similar to the following example:
Example CR with a version range specified

```yaml
apiVersion: olm.operatorframework.io/v1
kind: ClusterExtension
metadata:
  name: pipelines-operator
spec:
  namespace: pipelines
  serviceAccount:
    name: pipelines-installer
  source:
    sourceType: Catalog
    catalog:
      packageName: openshift-pipelines-operator-rh
      version: ">1.15, <1.17" 1
```

Specifies that the desired version range is greater than version 1.15 and less than 1.17. For more information, see "Support for version ranges" and "Version comparison strings".
* If you want to update to the latest version that can be resolved from a channel, edit your CR similar to the following example:
Example CR with a specified channel

```yaml
apiVersion: olm.operatorframework.io/v1
kind: ClusterExtension
metadata:
  name: pipelines-operator
spec:
  namespace: pipelines
  serviceAccount:
    name: pipelines-installer
  source:
    sourceType: Catalog
    catalog:
      packageName: openshift-pipelines-operator-rh
      channels:
        - latest 1
```

Installs the latest release that can be resolved from the specified channel. Updates to the channel are automatically installed. Enter values as an array.
* If you want to specify a channel and version or version range, edit your CR similar to the following example:
Example CR with a specified channel and version range

```yaml
apiVersion: olm.operatorframework.io/v1
kind: ClusterExtension
metadata:
  name: pipelines-operator
spec:
  namespace: pipelines
  serviceAccount:
    name: pipelines-installer
  source:
    sourceType: Catalog
    catalog:
      packageName: openshift-pipelines-operator-rh
      channels:
        - latest
      version: "<1.16"
```


For more information, see "Example custom resources (CRs) that specify a target version".
4. Apply the update to the cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f pipelines-operator.yaml
```

Example output

```text
clusterextension.olm.operatorframework.io/pipelines-operator configured
```


* Verify that the channel and version updates have been applied by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get clusterextension pipelines-operator -o yaml
```

Example output

```yaml

# Deleting an Operator

You can delete an Operator and its custom resource definitions (CRDs) by deleting the ClusterExtension custom resource (CR).

* You have a catalog installed.
* You have an Operator installed.

* Delete an Operator and its CRDs by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete clusterextension <operator_name>
```

Example output

```text
clusterextension.olm.operatorframework.io "<operator_name>" deleted
```


* Run the following commands to verify that your Operator and its resources were deleted:
* Verify the Operator is deleted by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get clusterextensions
```

Example output

```text
No resources found
```

* Verify that the Operator's system namespace is deleted by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get ns <operator_name>-system
```

Example output

```text
Error from server (NotFound): namespaces "<operator_name>-system" not found
```
