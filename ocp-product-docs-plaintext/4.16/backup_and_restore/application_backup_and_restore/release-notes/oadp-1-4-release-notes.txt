# OADP 1.4.4 release notes

OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.4.4 is a Container Grade Only (CGO) release, which is released to refresh the health grades of the containers. No code was changed in the product itself compared to that of OADP 1.4.3.

## Known issues

When you restore a stateful application that uses the azurefile-csi storage class, the restore operation remains in the Finalizing phase. (OADP-5508)

# OADP 1.4.3 release notes

The OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.4.3 release notes lists the following new feature.

## New features

With this release, the kubevirt velero plugin has been updated to version 0.7.1. Notable improvements include the following bug fix and new features:

* Virtual machine instances (VMIs) are no longer ignored from backup when the owner VM is excluded.
* Object graphs now include all extra objects during backup and restore operations.
* Optionally generated labels are now added to new firmware Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) during restore operations.
* Switching VM run strategies during restore operations is now possible.
* Clearing a MAC address by label is now supported.
* The restore-specific checks during the backup operation are now skipped.
* The VirtualMachineClusterInstancetype and VirtualMachineClusterPreference custom resource definitions (CRDs) are now supported.

# OADP 1.4.2 release notes

The OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.4.2 release notes lists new features, resolved issues and bugs, and known issues.

## New features

With this release, Velero provides resource policies to back up different volumes in the same namespace by using the VolumePolicy feature. The supported VolumePolicy feature to back up different volumes includes skip, snapshot, and fs-backup actions.
OADP-1071

File system backup and data mover can now use short-term credentials such as AWS Security Token Service (STS) and GCP WIF. With this support, backup is successfully completed without any PartiallyFailed status.
OADP-5095

## Resolved issues

Previously, if the provider of a Volume Snapshot Location (VSL) spec was incorrect, the Data Protection Application (DPA) reconciled successfully. With this update, DPA reports errors and requests for a valid provider value.
OADP-5044

Previously, when backup operation was executed by using OADP installed in one namespace but was restored by using OADP installed in a different namespace, the Data Mover restore failed. With this update, Data Mover restore is now successful.
OADP-5460

Previously, backup failed with the following error:


```terminal
Requests specifying Server Side Encryption with Customer provided keys must provide the client calculated MD5 of the secret key.
```


With this update, missing Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C) base64 and MD5 hash are now fixed. As a result, SSE-C backup works with the calculated MD5 of the secret key. In addition, incorrect errorhandling for the customerKey size is also fixed.
OADP-5388

For a complete list of all issues resolved in this release, see the list of OADP 1.4.2 resolved issues in Jira.

## Known issues

When a Data Protection Application (DPA) is created with the nodeSelector field set in the nodeAgent parameter, Data Mover restore partially fails instead of completing the restore operation.
OADP-5260

In the image registry backup, the S3 storage does not use the proxy environment when the insecureSkipTLSVerify parameter is set to true.
OADP-3143

Even after you delete a backup, Kopia does not delete the volume artifacts from the ${bucket_name}/kopia/${namespace} on the S3 location after backup expired. For more information, see "About Kopia repository maintenance".
OADP-5131

# OADP 1.4.1 release notes

The OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.4.1 release notes lists new features, resolved issues and bugs, and known issues.

## New features

You can nowÂ change Velero Server Kubernetes API queries per second and burst values by using the new Data Protection Application (DPA) fields. The new DPA fields are spec.configuration.velero.client-qps and spec.configuration.velero.client-burst, which both default to 100.
OADP-4076

With this update, you can now configure the hash, encryption, and splitter algorithms in Kopia to select non-default options to optimize performance for different backup workloads.

To configure these algorithms, set the env variable of a velero pod in the podConfig section of the DataProtectionApplication (DPA) configuration. If this variable is not set, or an unsupported algorithm is chosen, Kopia will default to its standard algorithms.
OADP-4640

## Resolved issues

Previously, restoring a backup without pods and having StorageClass VolumeBindingMode set as WaitForFirstConsumer, resulted in the PartiallyFailed status with an error: fail to patch dynamic PV, err: context deadline exceeded.
With this update, patching dynamic PV is skipped and restoring a backup is successful without any PartiallyFailed status.
OADP-4231

Previously, the PodVolumeBackup custom resource (CR) generated an incorrect message, which was: get a podvolumebackup with status "InProgress" during the server starting, mark it as "Failed".
With this update, the message produced is now:


```text
found a podvolumebackup with status "InProgress" during the server starting,
mark it as "Failed".
```


OADP-4224

Previously, OADP set the imagePullPolicy parameter to Always for all images.
With this update, OADP checks if each image contains sha256 or sha512 digest, then it sets imagePullPolicy to IfNotPresent; otherwise imagePullPolicy is set to Always. You can now override this policy by using the new spec.containerImagePullPolicy DPA field.
OADP-4172

Previously, OADP Velero failed to update the restored CR status. This left the status at InProgress indefinitely. Components which relied on the backup and restore CR status to determine the completion would fail.
With this update, the restore CR status for a restore correctly proceeds to the Completed or Failed status.
OADP-3227

Previously, when performing a restore of the BuildConfig Build resource from a different cluster, the application generated an error on TLS verification to the internal image registry. The resulting error was failed to verify certificate: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority error.
With this update, the restore of the BuildConfig build resources to a different cluster can proceed successfully without generating the failed to verify certificate error.
OADP-4692

Previously, downloading data failed while restoring an empty persistent volume claim (PVC). It failed with the following error:


```text
data path restore failed: Failed to run kopia restore: Unable to load
    snapshot : snapshot not found
```


With this update, the downloading of data proceeds to correct conclusion when restoring an empty PVC and the error message is not generated.
OADP-3106

Previously, a Velero memory leak was caused by using the CSI and DataMover plugins. When the backup ended, the Velero plugin instance was not deleted and the memory leak consumed memory until an Out of Memory (OOM) condition was generated in the Velero pod. With this update, there is no resulting Velero memory leak when using the CSI and DataMover plugins.
OADP-4448

Previously, due to the asynchronous nature of the Data Mover operation, a post-hook might be attempted before the Data Mover persistent volume claim (PVC) releases the persistent volumes (PVs) of the related pods. This problem would cause the backup to fail with a PartiallyFailed status.
With this update, the post-hook operation is not started until the related PVs are released by the Data Mover PVC, eliminating the PartiallyFailed backup status.
OADP-3140

When you install the OADP Operator in a namespace with more than 37 characters to create a new DPA, labeling the "cloud-credentials" Secret fails and the DPA reports the following error:


```
The generated label name is too long.
```


With this update, creating a DPA does not fail in namespaces with more than 37 characters in the name.
OADP-3960

Previously, in a large scale environment, the restore operation would result in a Partiallyfailed status with the error: fail to patch dynamic PV, err: context deadline exceeded.
With this update, the resourceTimeout Velero server argument is used to override this timeout error resulting in a successful restore.
OADP-4344

For a complete list of all issues resolved in this release, see the list of OADP 1.4.1 resolved issues in Jira.

## Known issues

After OADP restores, the Cassandra application pods might enter CrashLoopBackoff status. To work around this problem, delete the StatefulSet pods that are returning the error CrashLoopBackoff state after restoring OADP. The StatefulSet controller then recreates these pods and it runs normally.
OADP-4407

During a File System Backup (FSB) restore operation, a Deployment resource referencing an ImageStream is not restored properly. The restored pod that runs the FSB, and the postHook is terminated prematurely.

During the restore operation, the OpenShift Container Platform controller updates the spec.template.spec.containers[0].image field in the Deployment resource with an updated ImageStreamTag hash. The update triggers the rollout of a new pod, terminating the pod on which velero runs the FSB along with the post-hook. For more information about image stream trigger, see Triggering updates on image stream changes.

The workaround for this behavior is a two-step restore process:

1. Perform a restore excluding the Deployment resources, for example:

```terminal
$ velero restore create <RESTORE_NAME> \
  --from-backup <BACKUP_NAME> \
  --exclude-resources=deployment.apps
```

2. Once the first restore is successful, perform a second restore by including these resources, for example:

```terminal
$ velero restore create <RESTORE_NAME> \
  --from-backup <BACKUP_NAME> \
  --include-resources=deployment.apps
```

# OADP 1.4.0 release notes

The OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.4.0 release notes lists resolved issues and known issues.

## Resolved issues

Previously, while restoring the deleted application namespace, the restore operation partially failed with the resource name may not be empty error in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16.
With this update, restore works as expected in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16.
OADP-4075

Previously, Velero was using the earlier version of SDK where the Spec.SourceVolumeMode field did not exist. As a consequence, Data Mover backups failed in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 cluster on the external snapshotter with version 4.2.
With this update, external snapshotter is upgraded to version 7.0 and later. As a result, backups do not fail in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 cluster.
OADP-3922

For a complete list of all issues resolved in this release, see the list of OADP 1.4.0 resolved issues in Jira.

## Known issues

While performing a backup of any application with Noobaa as the backup location, if the checksumAlgorithm configuration parameter is not set, backup fails. To fix this problem, if you do not provide a value for checksumAlgorithm in the Backup Storage Location (BSL) configuration, an empty value is added.
The empty value is only added for BSLs that are created using Data Protection Application (DPA) custom resource (CR), and this value is not added if BSLs are created using any other method.
OADP-4274

## Upgrade notes


[NOTE]
----
Always upgrade to the next minor version. Do not skip versions. To update to a later version, upgrade only one channel at a time. For example, to upgrade from OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.1 to 1.3, upgrade first to 1.2, and then to 1.3.
----

### Changes from OADP 1.3 to 1.4

The Velero server has been updated from version 1.12 to 1.14. Note that there are no changes in the Data Protection Application (DPA).

This changes the following:

* The velero-plugin-for-csi code is now available in the Velero code, which means an init container is no longer required for the plugin.
* Velero changed client Burst and QPS defaults from 30 and 20 to 100 and 100, respectively.
* The velero-plugin-for-aws plugin updated default value of the spec.config.checksumAlgorithm field in BackupStorageLocation objects (BSLs) from "" (no checksum calculation) to the CRC32 algorithm. The checksum algorithm types are known to work only with AWS.
Several S3 providers require the md5sum to be disabled by setting the checksum algorithm to "". Confirm md5sum algorithm support and configuration with your storage provider.

In OADP 1.4, the default value for BSLs created within DPA for this configuration is "". This default value means that the md5sum is not checked, which is consistent with OADP 1.3. For BSLs created within DPA, update it by using the spec.backupLocations[].velero.config.checksumAlgorithm field in the DPA. If your BSLs are created outside DPA, you can update this configuration by using spec.config.checksumAlgorithm in the BSLs.

### Backing up the DPA configuration

You must back up your current DataProtectionApplication (DPA) configuration.

* Save your current DPA configuration by running the following command:
Example command

```terminal
$ oc get dpa -n openshift-adp -o yaml > dpa.orig.backup
```


### Upgrading the OADP Operator

Use the following procedure when upgrading the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Operator.

1. Change your subscription channel for the OADP Operator from stable-1.3 to stable-1.4.
2. Wait for the Operator and containers to update and restart.

* Updating installed Operators

## Converting DPA to the new version

To upgrade from OADP 1.3 to 1.4, no Data Protection Application (DPA) changes are required.

## Verifying the upgrade

Use the following procedure to verify the upgrade.

1. Verify the installation by viewing the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) resources by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get all -n openshift-adp
```
