Configuring the OpenShift API for Data Protection with Google Cloud Platform

You install the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) by installing the OADP Operator. The Operator installs Velero 1.12.

Starting from OADP 1.0.4, all OADP 1.0.z versions can only be used as a dependency of the MTC Operator and are not available as a standalone Operator.
You configure GCP for Velero, create a default Secret, and then install the Data Protection Application. For more details, see Installing the OADP Operator.

To install the OADP Operator in a restricted network environment, you must first disable the default OperatorHub sources and mirror the Operator catalog. See Using Operator Lifecycle Manager on restricted networks for details.
Configuring Google Cloud Platform
You configure Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP).

You must have the gcloud and gsutil CLI tools installed. See the Google cloud documentation for details.

About backup and snapshot locations and their secrets
You specify backup and snapshot locations and their secrets in the DataProtectionApplication custom resource (CR).


You specify AWS S3-compatible object storage, such as Multicloud Object Gateway or MinIO, as a backup location.

Velero backs up Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform resources, Kubernetes objects, and internal images as an archive file on object storage.


If you use your cloud provider's native snapshot API to back up persistent volumes, you must specify the cloud provider as the snapshot location.

If you use Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots, you do not need to specify a snapshot location because you will create a VolumeSnapshotClass CR to register the CSI driver.

If you use File System Backup (FSB), you do not need to specify a snapshot location because FSB backs up the file system on object storage.


If the backup and snapshot locations use the same credentials or if you do not require a snapshot location, you create a default Secret.

If the backup and snapshot locations use different credentials, you create two secret objects:

Custom Secret for the backup location, which you specify in the DataProtectionApplication CR.

Default Secret for the snapshot location, which is not referenced in the DataProtectionApplication CR.


The Data Protection Application requires a default Secret. Otherwise, the installation will fail.

If you do not want to specify backup or snapshot locations during the installation, you can create a default Secret with an empty credentials-velero file.
Creating a default Secret
You create a default Secret if your backup and snapshot locations use the same credentials or if you do not require a snapshot location.

The default name of the Secret is cloud-credentials-gcp.

The DataProtectionApplication custom resource (CR) requires a default Secret.  Otherwise, the installation will fail. If the name of the backup location Secret is not specified, the default name is used.

If you do not want to use the backup location credentials during the installation, you can create a Secret with the default name by using an empty credentials-velero file.
Your object storage and cloud storage, if any, must use the same credentials.

You must configure object storage for Velero.

You must create a credentials-velero file for the object storage in the appropriate format.


Create a Secret with the default name:


The Secret is referenced in the spec.backupLocations.credential block of the DataProtectionApplication CR when you install the Data Protection Application.
Creating secrets for different credentials
If your backup and snapshot locations use different credentials, you must create two Secret objects:

Backup location Secret with a custom name. The custom name is specified in the spec.backupLocations block of the DataProtectionApplication custom resource (CR).

Snapshot location Secret with the default name, cloud-credentials-gcp. This Secret is not specified in the DataProtectionApplication CR.


Create a credentials-velero file for the snapshot location in the appropriate format for your cloud provider.

Create a Secret for the snapshot location with the default name:

Create a credentials-velero file for the backup location in the appropriate format for your object storage.

Create a Secret for the backup location with a custom name:

Add the Secret with the custom name to the DataProtectionApplication CR, as in the following example:
Configuring the Data Protection Application
You can configure the Data Protection Application by setting Velero resource allocations or enabling self-signed CA certificates.

Setting Velero CPU and memory resource allocations
You set the CPU and memory resource allocations for the Velero pod by editing the  DataProtectionApplication custom resource (CR) manifest.

You must have the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Operator installed.


Edit the values in the spec.configuration.velero.podConfig.ResourceAllocations block of the DataProtectionApplication CR manifest, as in the following example:


Kopia is an option in OADP 1.3 and later releases. You can use Kopia for file system backups, and Kopia is your only option for Data Mover cases with the built-in Data Mover.

Kopia is more resource intensive than Restic, and you might need to adjust the CPU and memory requirements accordingly.
Enabling self-signed CA certificates
You must enable a self-signed CA certificate for object storage by editing the DataProtectionApplication custom resource (CR) manifest to prevent a certificate signed by unknown authority error.

You must have the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Operator installed.


Edit the spec.backupLocations.velero.objectStorage.caCert parameter and spec.backupLocations.velero.config parameters of the DataProtectionApplication CR manifest:


Using CA certificates with the velero command aliased for Velero deployment
You might want to use the Velero CLI without installing it locally on your system by creating an alias for it.

You must be logged in to the OpenShift Container Platform cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

You must have the OpenShift CLI (oc) installed.


In a future release of OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP), we plan to mount the certificate to the Velero pod so that this step is not required.
Installing the Data Protection Application 1.2 and earlier
You install the Data Protection Application (DPA) by creating an instance of the DataProtectionApplication API.

You must install the OADP Operator.

You must configure object storage as a backup location.

If you use snapshots to back up PVs, your cloud provider must support either a native snapshot API or Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots.

If the backup and snapshot locations use the same credentials, you must create a Secret with the default name, cloud-credentials-gcp.

If the backup and snapshot locations use different credentials, you must create two Secrets:

Google workload identity federation cloud authentication
Applications running outside Google Cloud use service account keys, such as usernames and passwords, to gain access to Google Cloud resources. These service account keys might become a security risk if they are not properly managed.

With Google's workload identity federation, you can use Identity and Access Management (IAM) to offer IAM roles, including the ability to impersonate service accounts, to external identities. This eliminates the maintenance and security risks associated with service account keys.

Workload identity federation handles encrypting and decrypting certificates, extracting user attributes, and validation. Identity federation externalizes authentication, passing it over to Security Token Services (STS), and reduces the demands on individual developers. Authorization and controlling access to resources remain the responsibility of the application.

Google workload identity federation is available for OADP 1.3.x and later.
When backing up volumes, OADP on GCP with Google workload identity federation authentication only supports CSI snapshots.

OADP on GCP with Google workload identity federation authentication does not support Volume Snapshot Locations (VSL) backups. For more details, see Google workload identity federation known issues.

If you do not use Google workload identity federation cloud authentication, continue to Installing the Data Protection Application.

You have installed a cluster in manual mode with GCP Workload Identity configured.

You have access to the Cloud Credential Operator utility (ccoctl) and to the associated workload identity pool.


Create an oadp-credrequest directory by running the following command:
