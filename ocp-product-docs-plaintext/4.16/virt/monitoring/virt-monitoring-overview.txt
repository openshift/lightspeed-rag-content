# Monitoring overview



You can monitor the health of your cluster and virtual machines (VMs) with the following tools:

Monitoring OpenShift Virtualization VMs health status:: View the overall health of your OpenShift Virtualization environment in the web console by navigating to the Home -> Overview page in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console. The Status card displays the overall health of OpenShift Virtualization based on the alerts and conditions.
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster checkup framework:: Run automated tests on your cluster with the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster checkup framework to check the following conditions:
* Network connectivity and latency between two VMs attached to a secondary network interface
* VM running a Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) workload with zero packet loss
* Cluster storage is optimally configured for OpenShift Virtualization
* The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster can run real-time virtualized workloads.

Prometheus queries for virtual resources:: Query vCPU, network, storage, and guest memory swapping usage and live migration progress.
VM custom metrics:: Configure the node-exporter service to expose internal VM metrics and processes.
VM health checks:: Configure readiness, liveness, and guest agent ping probes and a watchdog for VMs.
Runbooks:: Diagnose and resolve issues that trigger OpenShift Virtualization alerts in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.
