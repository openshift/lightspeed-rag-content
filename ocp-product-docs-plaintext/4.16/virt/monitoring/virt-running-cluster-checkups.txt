OpenShift Virtualization cluster checkup framework

OpenShift Virtualization includes the following predefined checkups that can be used for cluster maintenance and troubleshooting:


Latency checkup
Verifies network connectivity and measures latency between two virtual machines (VMs) that are attached to a secondary network interface.
DPDK checkup
Verifies that a node can run a VM with a Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) workload with zero packet loss.
Storage checkup
Verifies if the cluster storage is optimally configured for OpenShift Virtualization.
Real-time checkup
Verifies that your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster can run virtualized real-time workloads.


The OpenShift Virtualization cluster checkup framework is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

About the OpenShift Virtualization cluster checkup framework
A checkup is an automated test workload that allows you to verify if a specific cluster functionality works as expected. The cluster checkup framework uses native Kubernetes resources to configure and execute the checkup.

By using predefined checkups, cluster administrators and developers can improve cluster maintainability, troubleshoot unexpected behavior, minimize errors, and save time. They can also review the results of the checkup and share them with experts for further analysis. Vendors can write and publish checkups for features or services that they provide and verify that their customer environments are configured correctly.

Running a predefined checkup in an existing namespace involves setting up a service account for the checkup, creating the Role and RoleBinding objects for the service account, enabling permissions for the checkup, and creating the input config map and the checkup job. You can run a checkup multiple times.

You must always:

Verify that the checkup image is from a trustworthy source before applying it.

Review the checkup permissions before creating the Role and RoleBinding objects.
Running a latency checkup
You use a predefined checkup to verify network connectivity and measure latency between two virtual machines (VMs) that are attached to a secondary network interface. The latency checkup uses the ping utility.

You run a latency checkup by performing the following steps:

Create a service account, roles, and rolebindings to provide cluster access permissions to the latency checkup.

Create a config map to provide the input to run the checkup and to store the results.

Create a job to run the checkup.

Review the results in the config map.

Optional: To rerun the checkup, delete the existing config map and job and then create a new config map and job.

When you are finished, delete the latency checkup resources.


You installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

The cluster has at least two worker nodes.

You configured a network attachment definition for a namespace.


Create a ServiceAccount, Role, and RoleBinding manifest for the latency checkup:

Apply the ServiceAccount, Role, and RoleBinding manifest:

Create a ConfigMap manifest that contains the input parameters for the checkup:

Apply the config map manifest in the target namespace:

Create a Job manifest to run the checkup:

Apply the Job manifest:

Wait for the job to complete:

Review the results of the latency checkup by running the following command. If the maximum measured latency is greater than the value of the spec.param.maxDesiredLatencyMilliseconds attribute, the checkup fails and returns an error.

Optional: To view the detailed job log in case of checkup failure, use the following command:

Delete the job and config map that you previously created by running the following commands:

Optional: If you do not plan to run another checkup, delete the roles manifest:
DPDK checkup
Use a predefined checkup to verify that your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster node can run a virtual machine (VM) with a Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) workload with zero packet loss. The DPDK checkup runs traffic between a traffic generator and a VM running a test DPDK application.

You run a DPDK checkup by performing the following steps:

Create a service account, role, and role bindings for the DPDK checkup.

Create a config map to provide the input to run the checkup and to store the results.

Create a job to run the checkup.

Review the results in the config map.

Optional: To rerun the checkup, delete the existing config map and job and then create a new config map and job.

When you are finished, delete the DPDK checkup resources.


You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

The cluster is configured to run DPDK applications.

The project is configured to run DPDK applications.


Create a ServiceAccount, Role, and RoleBinding manifest for the DPDK checkup:

Apply the ServiceAccount, Role, and RoleBinding manifest:

Apply the ConfigMap manifest in the target namespace:

Create a Job manifest to run the checkup:

Apply the Job manifest:

Wait for the job to complete:

Review the results of the checkup by running the following command:

Delete the job and config map that you previously created by running the following commands:

Optional: If you do not plan to run another checkup, delete the ServiceAccount, Role, and RoleBinding manifest:


DPDK checkup config map parameters
The following table shows the mandatory and optional parameters that you can set in the data stanza of the input ConfigMap manifest when you run a cluster DPDK readiness checkup:
Building a container disk image for RHEL virtual machines
You can build a custom Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8 OS image in qcow2 format and use it to create a container disk image. You can store the container disk image in a registry that is accessible from your cluster and specify the image location in the spec.param.vmContainerDiskImage attribute of the DPDK checkup config map.

To build a container disk image, you must create an image builder virtual machine (VM). The image builder VM is a RHEL 8 VM that can be used to build custom RHEL images.

The image builder VM must run RHEL 8.7 and must have a minimum of 2 CPU cores, 4 GiB RAM, and 20 GB of free space in the /var directory.
