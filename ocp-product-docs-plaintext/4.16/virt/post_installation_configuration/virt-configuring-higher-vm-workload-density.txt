# Configuring higher VM workload density


To increase the number of virtual machines (VMs), you can configure a higher VM workload density in your cluster by overcommitting the amount of memory (RAM).

[IMPORTANT]
----
Configuring higher workload density is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
----
The following workloads are especially suited for higher workload density:
* Many similar workloads
* Underused workloads

[NOTE]
----
While overcommitted memory can lead to a higher workload density, it can also lower workload performance of a highly utilized system.

# Using wasp-agent to configure higher VM workload density

The wasp-agent component enables an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster to assign swap resources to virtual machine (VM) workloads.
Swap usage is only supported on worker nodes.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Swap resources can be only assigned to virtual machine workloads (VM pods) of the Burstable Quality of Service (QoS) class. VM pods of the Guaranteed QoS class and pods of any QoS class that do not belong to VMs cannot swap resources.
For descriptions of QoS classes, see Configure Quality of Service for Pods (Kubernetes documentation).
----

* The oc tool is available.
* You are logged into the cluster with the cluster-admin role.
* A memory over-commit ratio is defined.
* The node belongs to a worker pool.

1. Create a privileged service account by entering the following commands:

```terminal
$ oc adm new-project wasp
```


```terminal
$ oc create sa -n wasp wasp
```


```terminal
$ oc create clusterrolebinding wasp --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=wasp:wasp
```


```terminal
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user -n wasp privileged -z wasp
```


[NOTE]
----
The wasp-agent component deploys an OCI hook to enable swap usage for containers on the node level. The low-level nature requires the DaemonSet object to be privileged.
----
2. Deploy wasp-agent by creating a DaemonSet object as follows:

```yaml
kind: DaemonSet
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: wasp-agent
  namespace: wasp
  labels:
    app: wasp
    tier: node
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: wasp
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        description: >-
          Configures swap for workloads
      labels:
          name: wasp
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: wasp
      hostPID: true
      hostUsers: true
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 5
      containers:
        - name: wasp-agent
          image: >-
            registry.redhat.io/container-native-virtualization/wasp-agent-rhel9:v4.16
          imagePullPolicy: Always
          env:
          - name: "FSROOT"
            value: "/host"
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: 100m
              memory: 50M
          securityContext:
            privileged: true
          volumeMounts:
          - name: host
            mountPath: "/host"
      volumes:
      - name: host
        hostPath:
          path: "/"
      priorityClassName: system-node-critical
  updateStrategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 10%
      maxSurge: 0
status: {}
```

3. Configure the kubelet service to permit swap:
1. Create a KubeletConfiguration file as shown in the example:
Example of a KubeletConfiguration file

```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: KubeletConfig
metadata:
  name: custom-config
spec:
  machineConfigPoolSelector:
    matchLabels:
      pools.operator.machineconfiguration.openshift.io/worker: ''  # MCP
      #machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machine-role: worker # machine
      #node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: '' # node
  kubeletConfig:
    failSwapOn: false
    evictionSoft:
      memory.available: "1Gi"
    evictionSoftGracePeriod:
      memory.available: "10s"
```


If the cluster is already using an existing KubeletConfiguration file, add the following to the spec section:

```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: KubeletConfig
metadata:
  name: custom-config
# ...
spec
# ...
    kubeletConfig:
      evictionSoft:
        memory.available: 1Gi
      evictionSoftGracePeriod:
        memory.available: 1m30s
      failSwapOn: false
```

2. Run the following command:

```yaml
$ oc wait mcp worker --for condition=Updated=True
```

4. Create a MachineConfig object to provision swap as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
  name: 90-worker-swap
spec:
  config:
    ignition:
      version: 3.4.0
    systemd:
      units:
      - contents: |
          [Unit]
          Description=Provision and enable swap
          ConditionFirstBoot=no

          [Service]
          Type=oneshot
          Environment=SWAP_SIZE_MB=5000
          ExecStart=/bin/sh -c "sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/tmp/swapfile count=${SWAP_SIZE_MB} bs=1M && \
          sudo chmod 600 /var/tmp/swapfile && \
          sudo mkswap /var/tmp/swapfile && \
          sudo swapon /var/tmp/swapfile && \
          free -h && \
          sudo systemctl set-property --runtime system.slice MemorySwapMax=0 IODeviceLatencyTargetSec=\"/ 50ms\""

          [Install]
          RequiredBy=kubelet-dependencies.target
        enabled: true
        name: swap-provision.service
```


To have enough swap space for the worst-case scenario, make sure to have at least as much swap space provisioned as overcommitted RAM. Calculate the amount of swap space to be provisioned on a node using the following formula:

```terminal
NODE_SWAP_SPACE = NODE_RAM * (MEMORY_OVER_COMMIT_PERCENT / 100% - 1)
```


Example:

```terminal
NODE_SWAP_SPACE = 16 GB * (150% / 100% - 1)
                = 16 GB * (1.5 - 1)
                = 16 GB * (0.5)
                =  8 GB
```

5. Deploy alerting rules as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.openshift.io/v1
kind: AlertingRule
metadata:
  name: wasp-alerts
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
spec:
  groups:
  - name: wasp.rules
    rules:
    - alert: NodeSwapping
      annotations:
        description: Node {{ $labels.instance }} is swapping at a rate of {{ printf "%.2f" $value }} MB/s
        runbook_url: https://github.com/openshift-virtualization/wasp-agent/tree/main/runbooks/alerts/NodeSwapping.md
        summary: A node is swapping memory pages
      expr: |
        # In MB/s
        irate(node_memory_SwapFree_bytes{job="node-exporter"}[5m]) / 1024^2 > 0
      for: 1m
      labels:
        severity: critical
```

6. Configure OpenShift Virtualization to use memory overcommit either by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console or by editing the HyperConverged custom resource (CR) file as shown in the following example.

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: hco.kubevirt.io/v1beta1
kind: HyperConverged
metadata:
  name: kubevirt-hyperconverged
  namespace: openshift-cnv
spec:
  higherWorkloadDensity:
    memoryOvercommitPercentage: 150
```

7. Apply all the configurations to compute nodes in your cluster by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc patch --type=merge \
  -f <../manifests/hco-set-memory-overcommit.yaml> \
  --patch-file <../manifests/hco-set-memory-overcommit.yaml>
```


[NOTE]
----
After applying all configurations, the swap feature is fully available only after all MachineConfigPool rollouts are complete.
----

1. To verify the deployment of wasp-agent, run the following command:

```terminal
$  oc rollout status ds wasp-agent -n wasp
```


If the deployment is successful, the following message is displayed:

```terminal
daemon set "wasp-agent" successfully rolled out
```

2. To verify that swap is correctly provisioned, do the following:
1. Run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/worker
```

2. Select a node from the provided list and run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc debug node/<selected-node> -- free -m
```


If swap is provisioned correctly, an amount greater than zero is displayed, similar to the following:

3. Verify the OpenShift Virtualization memory overcommitment configuration by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get -n openshift-cnv HyperConverged kubevirt-hyperconverged -o jsonpath="{.spec.higherWorkloadDensity.memoryOvercommitPercentage}"
150
```


The returned value, for example 150, must match the value you had previously configured.
