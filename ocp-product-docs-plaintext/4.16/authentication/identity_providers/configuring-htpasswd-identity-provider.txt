# Configuring an htpasswd identity provider


Configure the htpasswd identity provider to allow users to log in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform with credentials from an htpasswd file.
To define an htpasswd identity provider, perform the following tasks:
1. Create an htpasswd file to store the user and password information.
2. Create
a secret to represent the htpasswd file.
3. Define an htpasswd identity provider resource that references the secret.
4. Apply the resource to
the default OAuth configuration to add the identity provider.

# About htpasswd authentication

Using htpasswd authentication in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform allows you to identify users based on an htpasswd file. An htpasswd file is a flat file that contains the user name and hashed password for each user. You can use the htpasswd utility to create this file.


[WARNING]
----
Do not use htpasswd authentication in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform for production environments. Use htpasswd authentication only for development environments.
----

# Creating the htpasswd file

See one of the following sections for instructions about how to create the htpasswd file:

* Creating an htpasswd file using Linux
* Creating an htpasswd file using Windows

## Creating an htpasswd file using Linux

To use the htpasswd identity provider, you must generate a flat file that
contains the user names and passwords for your cluster by using
htpasswd.

* Have access to the htpasswd utility. On Red Hat Enterprise Linux
this is available by installing the httpd-tools package.

1. Create or update your flat file with a user name and hashed password:

```terminal
$ htpasswd -c -B -b </path/to/users.htpasswd> <username> <password>
```


The command generates a hashed version of the password.

For example:

```terminal
$ htpasswd -c -B -b users.htpasswd <username> <password>
```

Example output

```terminal
Adding password for user user1
```

2. Continue to add or update credentials to the file:

```terminal
$ htpasswd -B -b </path/to/users.htpasswd> <user_name> <password>
```


## Creating an htpasswd file using Windows

To use the htpasswd identity provider, you must generate a flat file that
contains the user names and passwords for your cluster by using
htpasswd.

* Have access to htpasswd.exe. This file is included in the \bin
directory of many Apache httpd distributions.

1. Create or update your flat file with a user name and hashed password:

```terminal
> htpasswd.exe -c -B -b <\path\to\users.htpasswd> <username> <password>
```


The command generates a hashed version of the password.

For example:

```terminal
> htpasswd.exe -c -B -b users.htpasswd <username> <password>
```

Example output

```terminal
Adding password for user user1
```

2. Continue to add or update credentials to the file:

```terminal
> htpasswd.exe -b <\path\to\users.htpasswd> <username> <password>
```


# Creating the htpasswd secret

To use the htpasswd identity provider, you must define a secret that
contains the htpasswd user file.

* Create an htpasswd file.

* Create a Secret object that contains the htpasswd users file:

```terminal
$ oc create secret generic htpass-secret --from-file=htpasswd=<path_to_users.htpasswd> -n openshift-config 1
```

The secret key containing the users file for the --from-file argument must be named htpasswd, as shown in the above command.

[TIP]
----
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to create the secret:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: htpass-secret
  namespace: openshift-config
type: Opaque
data:
  htpasswd: <base64_encoded_htpasswd_file_contents>
```

----

# Sample htpasswd CR

The following custom resource (CR) shows the parameters and acceptable values for an
htpasswd identity provider.


```yaml
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: OAuth
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  identityProviders:
  - name: my_htpasswd_provider 1
    mappingMethod: claim 2
    type: HTPasswd
    htpasswd:
      fileData:
        name: htpass-secret 3
```


This provider name is prefixed to provider user names to form an identity
name.
Controls how mappings are established between this provider's identities and User objects.
An existing secret containing a file generated using
htpasswd.

* See Identity provider parameters for information on parameters, such as mappingMethod, that are common to all identity providers.

# Adding an identity provider to your cluster

After you install your cluster, add an identity provider to it so your
users can authenticate.

* Create an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* Create the custom resource (CR) for your identity providers.
* You must be logged in as an administrator.

1. Apply the defined CR:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f </path/to/CR>
```


[NOTE]
----
If a CR does not exist, oc apply creates a new CR and might trigger the following warning: Warning: oc apply should be used on resources created by either oc create --save-config or oc apply. In this case you can safely ignore this warning.
----
2. Log in to the cluster as a user from your identity provider, entering the
password when prompted.

```terminal
$ oc login -u <username>
```

3. Confirm that the user logged in successfully, and display the user name.

```terminal
$ oc whoami
```


# Updating users for an htpasswd identity provider

You can add or remove users from an existing htpasswd identity provider.

* You have created a Secret object that contains the htpasswd user file. This procedure assumes that it is named htpass-secret.
* You have configured an htpasswd identity provider. This procedure assumes that it is named my_htpasswd_provider.
* You have access to the htpasswd utility. On Red Hat Enterprise Linux this is available by installing the httpd-tools package.
* You have cluster administrator privileges.

1. Retrieve the htpasswd file from the htpass-secret Secret object and save the file to your file system:

```terminal
$ oc get secret htpass-secret -ojsonpath={.data.htpasswd} -n openshift-config | base64 --decode > users.htpasswd
```

2. Add or remove users from the users.htpasswd file.
* To add a new user:

```terminal
$ htpasswd -bB users.htpasswd <username> <password>
```

Example output

```terminal
Adding password for user <username>
```

* To remove an existing user:

```terminal
$ htpasswd -D users.htpasswd <username>
```

Example output

```terminal
Deleting password for user <username>
```

3. Replace the htpass-secret Secret object with the updated users in the users.htpasswd file:

```terminal
$ oc create secret generic htpass-secret --from-file=htpasswd=users.htpasswd --dry-run=client -o yaml -n openshift-config | oc replace -f -
```


[TIP]
----
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to replace the secret:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: htpass-secret
  namespace: openshift-config
type: Opaque
data:
  htpasswd: <base64_encoded_htpasswd_file_contents>
```

----
4. If you removed one or more users, you must additionally remove existing resources for each user.
1. Delete the User object:

```terminal
$ oc delete user <username>
```

Example output

```terminal
user.user.openshift.io "<username>" deleted
```


Be sure to remove the user, otherwise the user can continue using their token as long as it has not expired.
2. Delete the Identity object for the user:

```terminal
$ oc delete identity my_htpasswd_provider:<username>
```

Example output

```terminal
identity.user.openshift.io "my_htpasswd_provider:<username>" deleted
```


# Configuring identity providers using the web console

Configure your identity provider (IDP) through the web console instead of the CLI.

* You must be logged in to the web console as a cluster administrator.

1. Navigate to Administration -> Cluster Settings.
2. Under the Configuration tab, click OAuth.
3. Under the Identity Providers section, select your identity provider from the
Add drop-down menu.


[NOTE]
----
You can specify multiple IDPs through the web console without overwriting
existing IDPs.
