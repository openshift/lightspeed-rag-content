# Preparing an AWS STS cluster for the AWS Load Balancer Operator


You can install the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Load Balancer Operator on a cluster that uses the Security Token Service (STS). Follow these steps to prepare your cluster before installing the Operator.
The AWS Load Balancer Operator relies on the CredentialsRequest object to bootstrap the Operator and the AWS Load Balancer Controller. The AWS Load Balancer Operator waits until the required secrets are created and available.

# Prerequisites

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You know the infrastructure ID of your cluster. To show this ID, run the following command in your CLI:

```terminal
$ oc get infrastructure cluster -o=jsonpath="{.status.infrastructureName}"
```

* You know the OpenID Connect (OIDC) DNS information for your cluster. To show this information, enter the following command in your CLI:

```terminal
$ oc get authentication.config cluster -o=jsonpath="{.spec.serviceAccountIssuer}" 1
```

An OIDC DNS example is https://rh-oidc.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/28292va7ad7mr9r4he1fb09b14t59t4f.
* You logged into the AWS Web Console, navigated to IAM -> Access management -> Identity providers, and located the OIDC Amazon Resource Name (ARN) information. An OIDC ARN example is arn:aws:iam::777777777777:oidc-provider/<oidc_dns_url>.

# Creating an IAM role for the AWS Load Balancer Operator

An additional Amazon Web Services (AWS) Identity and Access Management (IAM) role is required to successfully install the AWS Load Balancer Operator on a cluster that uses STS. The IAM role is required to interact with subnets and Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs). The AWS Load Balancer Operator generates the CredentialsRequest object with the IAM role to bootstrap itself.

You can create the IAM role by using the following options:

* Using the Cloud Credential Operator utility (ccoctl) and a predefined CredentialsRequest object.
* Using the AWS CLI and predefined AWS manifests.

Use the AWS CLI if your environment does not support the ccoctl command.

## Creating an AWS IAM role by using the Cloud Credential Operator utility

You can use the Cloud Credential Operator utility (ccoctl) to create an AWS IAM role for the AWS Load Balancer Operator. An AWS IAM role interacts with subnets and Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs).

* You must extract and prepare the ccoctl binary.

1. Download the CredentialsRequest custom resource (CR) and store it in a directory by running the following command:

```terminal
$ curl --create-dirs -o <credentials_requests_dir>/operator.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/aws-load-balancer-operator/main/hack/operator-credentials-request.yaml
```

2. Use the ccoctl utility to create an AWS IAM role by running the following command:

```terminal
$ ccoctl aws create-iam-roles \
    --name <name> \
    --region=<aws_region> \
    --credentials-requests-dir=<credentials_requests_dir> \
    --identity-provider-arn <oidc_arn>
```

Example output

```terminal
2023/09/12 11:38:57 Role arn:aws:iam::777777777777:role/<name>-aws-load-balancer-operator-aws-load-balancer-operator created 1
2023/09/12 11:38:57 Saved credentials configuration to: /home/user/<credentials_requests_dir>/manifests/aws-load-balancer-operator-aws-load-balancer-operator-credentials.yaml
2023/09/12 11:38:58 Updated Role policy for Role <name>-aws-load-balancer-operator-aws-load-balancer-operator created
```

Note the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS IAM role that was created for the AWS Load Balancer Operator, such as arn:aws:iam::777777777777:role/<name>-aws-load-balancer-operator-aws-load-balancer-operator.

[NOTE]
----
The length of an AWS IAM role name must be less than or equal to 12 characters.
----

## Creating an AWS IAM role by using the AWS CLI

You can use the AWS Command Line Interface to create an IAM role for the AWS Load Balancer Operator. The IAM role is used to interact with subnets and Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs).

* You must have access to the AWS Command Line Interface (aws).

1. Generate a trust policy file by using your identity provider by running the following command:

```terminal
$ cat <<EOF > albo-operator-trust-policy.json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Federated": "<oidc_arn>" 1
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "<cluster_oidc_endpoint>:sub": "system:serviceaccount:aws-load-balancer-operator:aws-load-balancer-operator-controller-manager" 2
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
EOF
```

Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the OIDC identity provider, such as arn:aws:iam::777777777777:oidc-provider/rh-oidc.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/28292va7ad7mr9r4he1fb09b14t59t4f.
Specifies the service account for the AWS Load Balancer Controller. An example of <cluster_oidc_endpoint> is rh-oidc.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/28292va7ad7mr9r4he1fb09b14t59t4f.
2. Create the IAM role with the generated trust policy by running the following command:

```terminal
$ aws iam create-role --role-name albo-operator --assume-role-policy-document file://albo-operator-trust-policy.json
```

Example output

```terminal
ROLE	arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_number>:role/albo-operator	2023-08-02T12:13:22Z 1
ASSUMEROLEPOLICYDOCUMENT	2012-10-17
STATEMENT	sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity	Allow
STRINGEQUALS	system:serviceaccount:aws-load-balancer-operator:aws-load-balancer-controller-manager
PRINCIPAL	arn:aws:iam:<aws_account_number>:oidc-provider/<cluster_oidc_endpoint>
```

Note the ARN of the created AWS IAM role that was created for the AWS Load Balancer Operator, such as arn:aws:iam::777777777777:role/albo-operator.
3. Download the permission policy for the AWS Load Balancer Operator by running the following command:

```terminal
$ curl -o albo-operator-permission-policy.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/aws-load-balancer-operator/main/hack/operator-permission-policy.json
```

4. Attach the permission policy for the AWS Load Balancer Controller to the IAM role by running the following command:

```terminal
$ aws iam put-role-policy --role-name albo-operator --policy-name perms-policy-albo-operator --policy-document file://albo-operator-permission-policy.json
```


# Configuring the ARN role for the AWS Load Balancer Operator

You can configure the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) role for the AWS Load Balancer Operator as an environment variable. You can configure the ARN role by using the CLI.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

1. Create the aws-load-balancer-operator project by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc new-project aws-load-balancer-operator
```

2. Create the OperatorGroup object by running the following command:

```terminal
$ cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: aws-load-balancer-operator
  namespace: aws-load-balancer-operator
spec:
  targetNamespaces: []
EOF
```

3. Create the Subscription object by running the following command:

```terminal
$ cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: aws-load-balancer-operator
  namespace: aws-load-balancer-operator
spec:

  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
  config:
    env:
    - name: ROLEARN
      value: "<albo_role_arn>" 1
EOF
```

Specifies the ARN role to be used in the CredentialsRequest to provision the AWS credentials for the AWS Load Balancer Operator. An example for <albo_role_arn> is arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_number>:role/albo-operator.

[NOTE]
----
The AWS Load Balancer Operator waits until the secret is created before moving to the Available status.
----

# Creating an IAM role for the AWS Load Balancer Controller

The CredentialsRequest object for the AWS Load Balancer Controller must be set with a manually provisioned IAM role.

You can create the IAM role by using the following options:
