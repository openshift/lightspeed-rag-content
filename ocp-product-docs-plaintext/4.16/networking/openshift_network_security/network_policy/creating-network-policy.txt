Creating a network policy

As a user with the admin role, you can create a network policy for a namespace.
Example NetworkPolicy object
The following annotates an example NetworkPolicy object:

kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-27107 1
spec:
  podSelector: 2
    matchLabels:
      app: mongodb
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector: 3
        matchLabels:
          app: app
    ports: 4
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 27017
The name of the NetworkPolicy object.

A selector that describes the pods to which the policy applies.
The policy object can only select pods in the project that defines the NetworkPolicy object.

A selector that matches the pods from which the policy object allows ingress traffic. The selector matches pods in the same namespace as the NetworkPolicy.

A list of one or more destination ports on which to accept traffic.
Creating a network policy using the CLI
To define granular rules describing ingress or egress network traffic allowed for namespaces in your cluster, you can create a network policy.

If you log in with a user with the cluster-admin role, then you can create a network policy in any namespace in the cluster.
Your cluster uses a network plugin that supports NetworkPolicy objects, such as the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin or the OpenShift SDN network plugin with mode: NetworkPolicy set. This mode is the default for OpenShift SDN.

You installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You are logged in to the cluster with a user with admin privileges.

You are working in the namespace that the network policy applies to.


Create a policy rule:

To create the network policy object, enter the following command:


If you log in to the web console with cluster-admin privileges, you have a choice of creating a network policy in any namespace in the cluster directly in YAML or from a form in the web console.
Creating a default deny all network policy
This is a fundamental policy, blocking all cross-pod networking other than network traffic allowed by the configuration of other deployed network policies. This procedure enforces a default deny-by-default policy.

If you log in with a user with the cluster-admin role, then you can create a network policy in any namespace in the cluster.
Your cluster uses a network plugin that supports NetworkPolicy objects, such as the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin or the OpenShift SDN network plugin with mode: NetworkPolicy set. This mode is the default for OpenShift SDN.

You installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You are logged in to the cluster with a user with admin privileges.

You are working in the namespace that the network policy applies to.


Create the following YAML that defines a deny-by-default policy to deny ingress from all pods in all namespaces. Save the YAML in the deny-by-default.yaml file:

Apply the policy by entering the following command:
Creating a network policy to allow traffic from external clients
With the deny-by-default policy in place you can proceed to configure a policy that allows traffic from external clients to a pod with the label app=web.

If you log in with a user with the cluster-admin role, then you can create a network policy in any namespace in the cluster.
Follow this procedure to configure a policy that allows external service from the public Internet directly or by using a Load Balancer to access the pod. Traffic is only allowed to a pod with the label app=web.

Your cluster uses a network plugin that supports NetworkPolicy objects, such as the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin or the OpenShift SDN network plugin with mode: NetworkPolicy set. This mode is the default for OpenShift SDN.

You installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You are logged in to the cluster with a user with admin privileges.

You are working in the namespace that the network policy applies to.


Create a policy that allows traffic from the public Internet directly or by using a load balancer to access the pod. Save the YAML in the web-allow-external.yaml file:

Apply the policy by entering the following command:
Creating a network policy allowing traffic to an application from all namespaces
If you log in with a user with the cluster-admin role, then you can create a network policy in any namespace in the cluster.
Follow this procedure to configure a policy that allows traffic from all pods in all namespaces to a particular application.

Your cluster uses a network plugin that supports NetworkPolicy objects, such as the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin or the OpenShift SDN network plugin with mode: NetworkPolicy set. This mode is the default for OpenShift SDN.

You installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You are logged in to the cluster with a user with admin privileges.

You are working in the namespace that the network policy applies to.


Create a policy that allows traffic from all pods in all namespaces to a particular application. Save the YAML in the web-allow-all-namespaces.yaml file:

Apply the policy by entering the following command:


Start a web service in the default namespace by entering the following command:

Run the following command to deploy an alpine image in the secondary namespace and to start a shell:

Run the following command in the shell and observe that the request is allowed:
Creating a network policy allowing traffic to an application from a namespace
If you log in with a user with the cluster-admin role, then you can create a network policy in any namespace in the cluster.
Follow this procedure to configure a policy that allows traffic to a pod with the label app=web from a particular namespace. You might want to do this to:

Restrict traffic to a production database only to namespaces where production workloads are deployed.

Enable monitoring tools deployed to a particular namespace to scrape metrics from the current namespace.

You are working in the namespace that the network policy applies to.


Create a policy that allows traffic from all pods in a particular namespaces with a label purpose=production. Save the YAML in the web-allow-prod.yaml file:

Apply the policy by entering the following command:


Start a web service in the default namespace by entering the following command:

Run the following command to create the prod namespace:

Run the following command to label the prod namespace:

Run the following command to create the dev namespace:

Run the following command to label the dev namespace:

Run the following command to deploy an alpine image in the dev namespace and to start a shell:

Run the following command in the shell and observe that the request is blocked:

Run the following command to deploy an alpine image in the prod namespace and start a shell:

Run the following command in the shell and observe that the request is allowed:
