# Installing the SR-IOV Network Operator


You can install the Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) Network Operator on your cluster to manage SR-IOV network devices and network attachments.

# Installing the SR-IOV Network Operator

As a cluster administrator, you can install the Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) Network Operator by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI or the web console.

## CLI: Installing the SR-IOV Network Operator

As a cluster administrator, you can install the Operator using the CLI.

* A cluster installed on bare-metal hardware with nodes that have hardware that supports SR-IOV.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* An account with cluster-admin privileges.

1. Create the openshift-sriov-network-operator namespace by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ cat << EOF| oc create -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: openshift-sriov-network-operator
  annotations:
    workload.openshift.io/allowed: management
EOF
```

2. Create an OperatorGroup custom resource (CR) by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ cat << EOF| oc create -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: sriov-network-operators
  namespace: openshift-sriov-network-operator
spec:
  targetNamespaces:
  - openshift-sriov-network-operator
EOF
```

3. Create a Subscription CR for the SR-IOV Network Operator by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ cat << EOF| oc create -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: sriov-network-operator-subscription
  namespace: openshift-sriov-network-operator
spec:
  channel: stable
  name: sriov-network-operator
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
EOF
```

4. Create an SriovoperatorConfig resource by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1
kind: SriovOperatorConfig
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: openshift-sriov-network-operator
spec:
  enableInjector: true
  enableOperatorWebhook: true
  logLevel: 2
  disableDrain: false
EOF
```


* Check that the Operator is installed by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get csv -n openshift-sriov-network-operator \
  -o custom-columns=Name:.metadata.name,Phase:.status.phase
```

Example output

```terminal
Name                                         Phase
sriov-network-operator.4.16.0-202406131906   Succeeded
```


## Web console: Installing the SR-IOV Network Operator

As a cluster administrator, you can install the Operator using the web console.

* A cluster installed on bare-metal hardware with nodes that have hardware that supports SR-IOV.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* An account with cluster-admin privileges.

1. Install the SR-IOV Network Operator:
1. In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, click Operators -> OperatorHub.
2. Select SR-IOV Network Operator from the list of available Operators, and then click Install.
3. On the Install Operator page, under Installed Namespace, select Operator recommended Namespace.
4. Click Install.
2. Verify that the SR-IOV Network Operator is installed successfully:
1. Navigate to the Operators -> Installed Operators page.
2. Ensure that SR-IOV Network Operator is listed in the openshift-sriov-network-operator project with a Status of InstallSucceeded.

[NOTE]
----
During installation an Operator might display a Failed status.
If the installation later succeeds with an InstallSucceeded message, you can ignore the Failed message.
----

If the Operator does not appear as installed, to troubleshoot further:
* Inspect the Operator Subscriptions and Install Plans tabs for any failure or errors under Status.
* Navigate to the Workloads -> Pods page and check the logs for pods in the openshift-sriov-network-operator project.
* Check the namespace of the YAML file. If the annotation is missing, you can add the annotation workload.openshift.io/allowed=management to the Operator namespace with the following command:

```terminal
$ oc annotate ns/openshift-sriov-network-operator workload.openshift.io/allowed=management
```


[NOTE]
----
For single-node OpenShift clusters, the annotation workload.openshift.io/allowed=management is required for the namespace.
