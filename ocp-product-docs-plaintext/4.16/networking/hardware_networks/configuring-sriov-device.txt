Configuring an SR-IOV network device

You can configure a Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) device in your cluster.
SR-IOV network node configuration object
You specify the SR-IOV network device configuration for a node by creating an SR-IOV network node policy. The API object for the policy is part of the sriovnetwork.openshift.io API group.

The following YAML describes an SR-IOV network node policy:

apiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1
kind: SriovNetworkNodePolicy
metadata:
  name: <name> 1
  namespace: openshift-sriov-network-operator 2
spec:
  resourceName: <sriov_resource_name> 3
  nodeSelector:
    feature.node.kubernetes.io/network-sriov.capable: "true" 4
  priority: <priority> 5
  mtu: <mtu> 6
  needVhostNet: false 7
  numVfs: <num> 8
  externallyManaged: false 9
  nicSelector: 10
    vendor: "<vendor_code>" 11
    deviceID: "<device_id>" 12
    pfNames: ["<pf_name>", ...] 13
    rootDevices: ["<pci_bus_id>", ...] 14
    netFilter: "<filter_string>" 15
  deviceType: <device_type> 16
  isRdma: false 17
  linkType: <link_type> 18
  eSwitchMode: "switchdev" 19
  excludeTopology: false 20
The name for the custom resource object.

The namespace where the SR-IOV Network Operator is installed.

The resource name of the SR-IOV network device plugin. You can create multiple SR-IOV network node policies for a resource name.

The node selector specifies the nodes to configure. Only SR-IOV network devices on the selected nodes are configured. The SR-IOV Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin and device plugin are deployed on selected nodes only.

Optional: The priority is an integer value between 0 and 99. A smaller value receives higher priority. For example, a priority of 10 is a higher priority than 99. The default value is 99.

Optional: The maximum transmission unit (MTU) of the virtual function. The maximum MTU value can vary for different network interface controller (NIC) models.

Optional: Set needVhostNet to true to mount the /dev/vhost-net device in the pod. Use the mounted /dev/vhost-net device with Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) to forward traffic to the kernel network stack.

The number of the virtual functions (VF) to create for the SR-IOV physical network device. For an Intel network interface controller (NIC), the number of VFs cannot be larger than the total VFs supported by the device. For a Mellanox NIC, the number of VFs cannot be larger than 128.

Set externallyManaged to true to allow the SR-IOV Network Operator to use all or a subset of externally managed virtual functions (VFs) and attach them to pods. With the value set to false the SR-IOV Network Operator manages and configures all allocated VFs.

The NIC selector identifies the device for the Operator to configure. You do not have to specify values for all the parameters. It is recommended to identify the network device with enough precision to avoid selecting a device unintentionally.

Optional: The vendor hexadecimal code of the SR-IOV network device. The only allowed values are 8086 and 15b3.

Optional: The device hexadecimal code of the SR-IOV network device. For example, 101b is the device ID for a Mellanox ConnectX-6 device.

Optional: An array of one or more physical function (PF) names for the device.

Optional: An array of one or more PCI bus addresses for the PF of the device. Provide the address in the following format: 0000:02:00.1.

Optional: The platform-specific network filter. The only supported platform is Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP). Acceptable values use the following format: openstack/NetworkID:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx. Replace xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx with the value from the /var/config/openstack/latest/network_data.json metadata file.

Optional: The driver type for the virtual functions. The only allowed values are netdevice and vfio-pci. The default value is netdevice.

Optional: Configures whether to enable remote direct memory access (RDMA) mode. The default value is false.

Optional: The link type for the VFs. The default value is eth for Ethernet. Change this value to 'ib' for InfiniBand.

Optional: To enable hardware offloading, the eSwitchMode field must be set to "switchdev".

Optional: To exclude advertising an SR-IOV network resource's NUMA node to the Topology Manager, set the value to true. The default value is false.


SR-IOV network node configuration examples
The following example describes the configuration for an InfiniBand device:

apiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1
kind: SriovNetworkNodePolicy
metadata:
  name: policy-ib-net-1
  namespace: openshift-sriov-network-operator
spec:
  resourceName: ibnic1
  nodeSelector:
    feature.node.kubernetes.io/network-sriov.capable: "true"
  numVfs: 4
  nicSelector:
    vendor: "15b3"
    deviceID: "101b"
    rootDevices:
      - "0000:19:00.0"
  linkType: ib
  isRdma: true
The following example describes the configuration for an SR-IOV network device in a RHOSP virtual machine:

apiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1
kind: SriovNetworkNodePolicy
metadata:
  name: policy-sriov-net-openstack-1
  namespace: openshift-sriov-network-operator
spec:
  resourceName: sriovnic1
  nodeSelector:
    feature.node.kubernetes.io/network-sriov.capable: "true"
  numVfs: 1 1
  nicSelector:
    vendor: "15b3"
    deviceID: "101b"
    netFilter: "openstack/NetworkID:ea24bd04-8674-4f69-b0ee-fa0b3bd20509" 2
The numVfs field is always set to 1 when configuring the node network policy for a virtual machine.

The netFilter field must refer to a network ID when the virtual machine is deployed on RHOSP. Valid values for netFilter are available from an SriovNetworkNodeState object.
Virtual function (VF) partitioning for SR-IOV devices
In some cases, you might want to split virtual functions (VFs) from the same physical function (PF) into multiple resource pools. For example, you might want some of the VFs to load with the default driver and the remaining VFs load with the vfio-pci driver. In such a deployment, the pfNames selector in your SriovNetworkNodePolicy custom resource (CR) can be used to specify a range of VFs for a pool using the following format: <pfname>#<first_vf>-<last_vf>.

For example, the following YAML shows the selector for an interface named netpf0 with VF 2 through 7:

pfNames: ["netpf0#2-7"]
netpf0 is the PF interface name.

2 is the first VF index (0-based) that is included in the range.

7 is the last VF index (0-based) that is included in the range.


You can select VFs from the same PF by using different policy CRs if the following requirements are met:

The numVfs value must be identical for policies that select the same PF.

The VF index must be in the range of 0 to <numVfs>-1. For example, if you have a policy with numVfs set to 8, then the <first_vf> value must not be smaller than 0, and the <last_vf> must not be larger than 7.

The VFs ranges in different policies must not overlap.

The <first_vf> must not be larger than the <last_vf>.


The following example illustrates NIC partitioning for an SR-IOV device.

The policy policy-net-1 defines a resource pool net-1 that contains the VF 0 of PF netpf0 with the default VF driver. The policy policy-net-1-dpdk defines a resource pool net-1-dpdk that contains the VF 8 to 15 of PF netpf0 with the vfio VF driver.

Policy policy-net-1:

apiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1
kind: SriovNetworkNodePolicy
metadata:
  name: policy-net-1
  namespace: openshift-sriov-network-operator
spec:
  resourceName: net1
  nodeSelector:
    feature.node.kubernetes.io/network-sriov.capable: "true"
  numVfs: 16
  nicSelector:
    pfNames: ["netpf0#0-0"]
  deviceType: netdevice
Policy policy-net-1-dpdk:

apiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1
kind: SriovNetworkNodePolicy
metadata:
  name: policy-net-1-dpdk
  namespace: openshift-sriov-network-operator
spec:
  resourceName: net1dpdk
  nodeSelector:
    feature.node.kubernetes.io/network-sriov.capable: "true"
  numVfs: 16
  nicSelector:
    pfNames: ["netpf0#8-15"]
  deviceType: vfio-pci
Confirm that the interface partitioned to virtual functions (VFs) for the SR-IOV device by running the following command.

$ ip link show <interface> 1
Replace <interface> with the interface that you specified when partitioning to VFs for the SR-IOV device, for example, ens3f1.


5: ens3f1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000

Configuring SR-IOV network devices
The SR-IOV Network Operator adds the SriovNetworkNodePolicy.sriovnetwork.openshift.io CustomResourceDefinition to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. You can configure an SR-IOV network device by creating a SriovNetworkNodePolicy custom resource (CR).

When applying the configuration specified in a SriovNetworkNodePolicy object, the SR-IOV Operator might drain the nodes, and in some cases, reboot nodes.

It might take several minutes for a configuration change to apply.
You installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

You have installed the SR-IOV Network Operator.

You have enough available nodes in your cluster to handle the evicted workload from drained nodes.

You have not selected any control plane nodes for SR-IOV network device configuration.


Create an SriovNetworkNodePolicy object, and then save the YAML in the <name>-sriov-node-network.yaml file. Replace <name> with the name for this configuration.

Optional: Label the SR-IOV capable cluster nodes with SriovNetworkNodePolicy.Spec.NodeSelector if they are not already labeled. For more information about labeling nodes, see "Understanding how to update labels on nodes".

Create the SriovNetworkNodePolicy object:

To verify that the SR-IOV network device is configured, enter the following command. Replace <node_name> with the name of a node with the SR-IOV network device that you just configured.


Understanding how to update labels on nodes.


Configuring parallel node draining during SR-IOV network policy updates
By default, the SR-IOV Network Operator drains workloads from a node before every policy change. The Operator performs this action, one node at a time, to ensure that no workloads are affected by the reconfiguration.

In large clusters, draining nodes sequentially can be time-consuming, taking hours or even days. In time-sensitive environments, you can enable parallel node draining in an SriovNetworkPoolConfig custom resource (CR) for faster rollouts of SR-IOV network configurations.

To configure parallel draining, use the SriovNetworkPoolConfig CR to create a node pool. You can then add nodes to the pool and define the maximum number of nodes in the pool that the Operator can drain in parallel. With this approach, you can enable parallel draining for faster reconfiguration while ensuring you still have enough nodes remaining in the pool to handle any running workloads.

A node can only belong to one SR-IOV network pool configuration. If a node is not part of a pool, it is added to a virtual, default, pool that is configured to drain one node at a time only.

The node might restart during the draining process.
Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

Install the SR-IOV Network Operator.

Nodes have hardware that support SR-IOV.


Create a SriovNetworkPoolConfig resource:

Create the sriov-test namespace by running the following comand:

Create a SriovNetworkNodePolicy resource:

Create a SriovNetwork resource:


View the node pool you created by running the following command:


To demonstrate the node draining process using the example scenario from the above procedure, complete the following steps:

Update the number of virtual functions in the SriovNetworkNodePolicy resource to trigger workload draining in the cluster:

Monitor the draining status on the target cluster by running the following command:
Troubleshooting SR-IOV configuration
After following the procedure to configure an SR-IOV network device, the following sections address some error conditions.

To display the state of nodes, run the following command:

$ oc get sriovnetworknodestates -n openshift-sriov-network-operator <node_name>
where: <node_name> specifies the name of a node with an SR-IOV network device.

"lastSyncError": "write /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:3b:00.1/sriov_numvfs: cannot allocate memory"
When a node indicates that it cannot allocate memory, check the following items:

Confirm that global SR-IOV settings are enabled in the BIOS for the node.

Confirm that VT-d is enabled in the BIOS for the node.
Assigning an SR-IOV network to a VRF
As a cluster administrator, you can assign an SR-IOV network interface to your VRF domain by using the CNI VRF plugin.

To do this, add the VRF configuration to the optional metaPlugins parameter of the SriovNetwork resource.

Applications that use VRFs need to bind to a specific device. The common usage is to use the SO_BINDTODEVICE option for a socket. SO_BINDTODEVICE binds the socket to a device that is specified in the passed interface name, for example, eth1. To use SO_BINDTODEVICE, the application must have CAP_NET_RAW capabilities.

Using a VRF through the ip vrf exec command is not supported in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform pods. To use VRF, bind applications directly to the VRF interface.
Creating an additional SR-IOV network attachment with the CNI VRF plugin
The SR-IOV Network Operator manages additional network definitions. When you specify an additional SR-IOV network to create, the SR-IOV Network Operator creates the NetworkAttachmentDefinition custom resource (CR) automatically.

Do not edit NetworkAttachmentDefinition custom resources that the SR-IOV Network Operator manages. Doing so might disrupt network traffic on your additional network.
To create an additional SR-IOV network attachment with the CNI VRF plugin, perform the following procedure.

Install the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI (oc).

Log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.


Create the SriovNetwork custom resource (CR) for the additional SR-IOV network attachment and insert the metaPlugins configuration, as in the following example CR. Save the YAML as the file sriov-network-attachment.yaml.

Create the SriovNetwork resource:


Confirm that the SR-IOV Network Operator created the NetworkAttachmentDefinition CR by running the following command.


To verify that the VRF CNI is correctly configured and the additional SR-IOV network attachment is attached, do the following:

Create an SR-IOV network that uses the VRF CNI.

Assign the network to a pod.

Verify that the pod network attachment is connected to the SR-IOV additional network. Remote shell into the pod and run the following command:

Confirm the VRF interface is master of the secondary interface:
Exclude the SR-IOV network topology for NUMA-aware scheduling
You can exclude advertising the Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) node for the SR-IOV network to the Topology Manager for more flexible SR-IOV network deployments during NUMA-aware pod scheduling.

In some scenarios, it is a priority to maximize CPU and memory resources for a pod on a single NUMA node. By not providing a hint to the Topology Manager about the NUMA node for the pod's SR-IOV network resource, the Topology Manager can deploy the SR-IOV network resource and the pod CPU and memory resources to different NUMA nodes. This can add to network latency because of the data transfer between NUMA nodes. However, it is acceptable in scenarios when workloads require optimal CPU and memory performance.

For example, consider a compute node, compute-1, that features two NUMA nodes: numa0 and numa1. The SR-IOV-enabled NIC is present on numa0. The CPUs available for pod scheduling are present on numa1 only. By setting the excludeTopology specification to true, the Topology Manager can assign CPU and memory resources for the pod to numa1 and can assign the SR-IOV network resource for the same pod to numa0. This is only possible when you set the excludeTopology specification to true. Otherwise, the Topology Manager attempts to place all resources on the same NUMA node.

Excluding the SR-IOV network topology for NUMA-aware scheduling
To exclude advertising the SR-IOV network resource's Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) node to the Topology Manager, you can configure the excludeTopology specification in the SriovNetworkNodePolicy custom resource. Use this configuration for more flexible SR-IOV network deployments during NUMA-aware pod scheduling.

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You have configured the CPU Manager policy to static. For more information about CPU Manager, see the Additional resources section.

You have configured the Topology Manager policy to single-numa-node.

You have installed the SR-IOV Network Operator.


Create the SriovNetworkNodePolicy CR:

Create the SriovNetwork CR:

Create a pod and assign the SR-IOV network resource from the previous step:


Verify the status of the pod by running the following command, replacing <pod_name> with the name of the pod:

Open a debug session with the target pod to verify that the SR-IOV network resources are deployed to a different node than the memory and CPU resources.


If the excludeTopology specification is set to True, it is possible that the required resources exist in the same NUMA node.
