# Configuring the node port service range


As a cluster administrator, you can expand the available node port range. If your cluster uses of a large number of node ports, you might need to increase the number of available ports.
The default port range is 30000-32767. You can never reduce the port range, even if you first expand it beyond the default range.

# Prerequisites

* Your cluster infrastructure must allow access to the ports that you specify within the expanded range. For example, if you expand the node port range to 30000-32900, the inclusive port range of 32768-32900 must be allowed by your firewall or packet filtering configuration.

# Expanding the node port range

You can expand the node port range for the cluster.


[IMPORTANT]
----
You can expand the node port range into the protected port range, which is between 0 and 32767. However, after expansion, you cannot change the range. Attempting to change the range returns the following error:
The Network "cluster" is invalid: spec.serviceNodePortRange: Invalid value: "30000-32767": new service node port range 30000-32767 does not completely cover the previous range 0-32767.
Before making changes, ensure that the new range you set is appropriate for your cluster.
----

* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* Log in to the cluster with a user with cluster-admin privileges.

1. To expand the node port range, enter the following command. Replace <port> with the largest port number in the new range.

```terminal
$ oc patch network.config.openshift.io cluster --type=merge -p \
  '{
    "spec":
      { "serviceNodePortRange": "30000-<port>" }
  }'
```


[TIP]
----
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to update the node port range:

```yaml
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  serviceNodePortRange: "30000-<port>"
```

----
Example output

```terminal
network.config.openshift.io/cluster patched
```

2. To confirm that the configuration is active, enter the following command. It can take several minutes for the update to apply.

```terminal
$ oc get configmaps -n openshift-kube-apiserver config \
  -o jsonpath="{.data['config\.yaml']}" | \
  grep -Eo '"service-node-port-range":["[[:digit:]]+-[[:digit:]]+"]'
```

Example output

```terminal
"service-node-port-range":["30000-33000"]
```
