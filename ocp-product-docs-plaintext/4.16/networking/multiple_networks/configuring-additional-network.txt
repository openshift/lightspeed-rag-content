Configuring an additional network

As a cluster administrator, you can configure an additional network for your cluster. The following network types are supported:

Bridge

Host device

VLAN

IPVLAN

MACVLAN

TAP

OVN-Kubernetes
Approaches to managing an additional network
You can manage the life cycle of an additional network by two approaches. Each approach is mutually exclusive and you can only use one approach for managing an additional network at a time. For either approach, the additional network is managed by a Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin that you configure.

For an additional network, IP addresses are provisioned through an IP Address Management (IPAM) CNI plugin that you configure as part of the additional network. The IPAM plugin supports a variety of IP address assignment approaches including DHCP and static assignment.

Modify the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) configuration: The CNO automatically creates and manages the NetworkAttachmentDefinition object. In addition to managing the object lifecycle the CNO ensures a DHCP is available for an additional network that uses a DHCP assigned IP address.

Applying a YAML manifest: You can manage the additional network directly by creating an NetworkAttachmentDefinition object. This approach allows for the chaining of CNI plugins.


When deploying Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform nodes with multiple network interfaces on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) with OVN SDN, DNS configuration of the secondary interface might take precedence over the DNS configuration of the primary interface. In this case, remove the DNS nameservers for the subnet id that is attached to the secondary interface:

$ openstack subnet set --dns-nameserver 0.0.0.0 <subnet_id>
Configuration for an additional network attachment
An additional network is configured by using the NetworkAttachmentDefinition API in the k8s.cni.cncf.io API group.

Do not store any sensitive information or a secret in the NetworkAttachmentDefinition object because this information is accessible by the project administration user.
The configuration for the API is described in the following table:


Configuration of an additional network through the Cluster Network Operator
The configuration for an additional network attachment is specified as part of the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) configuration.

The following YAML describes the configuration parameters for managing an additional network with the CNO:

apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  # ...
  additionalNetworks: 1
  - name: <name> 2
    namespace: <namespace> 3
    rawCNIConfig: |- 4
      {
        ...
      }
    type: Raw
An array of one or more additional network configurations.

The name for the additional network attachment that you are
creating. The name must be unique within the specified namespace.

The namespace to create the network attachment in. If
you do not specify a value, then the default namespace is used.

A CNI plugin configuration in JSON format.
Configuration of an additional network from a YAML manifest
The configuration for an additional network is specified from a YAML configuration file, such as in the following example:

apiVersion: k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: <name> 1
spec:
  config: |- 2
    {
      ...
    }
The name for the additional network attachment that you are
creating.

A CNI plugin configuration in JSON format.
Configurations for additional network types
The specific configuration fields for additional networks is described in the following sections.

Configuration for a bridge additional network
The following object describes the configuration parameters for the Bridge CNI plugin:


The VLAN parameter configures the VLAN tag on the host end of the veth and also enables the vlan_filtering feature on the bridge interface.
To configure an uplink for an L2 network, you must allow the VLAN on the uplink interface by using the following command:

$  bridge vlan add vid VLAN_ID dev DEV
Bridge CNI plugin configuration example
The following example configures an additional network named bridge-net:

{
  "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
  "name": "bridge-net",
  "type": "bridge",
  "isGateway": true,
  "vlan": 2,
  "ipam": {
    "type": "dhcp"
    }
}
Configuration for a host device additional network
Specify your network device by setting only one of the following parameters: device,hwaddr, kernelpath, or pciBusID.
The following object describes the configuration parameters for the host-device CNI plugin:


host-device configuration example
The following example configures an additional network named hostdev-net:

{
  "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
  "name": "hostdev-net",
  "type": "host-device",
  "device": "eth1"
}
Configuration for an VLAN additional network
The following object describes the configuration parameters for the VLAN CNI plugin:


vlan configuration example
The following example configures an additional network named vlan-net:

{
  "name": "vlan-net",
  "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
  "type": "vlan",
  "master": "eth0",
  "mtu": 1500,
  "vlanId": 5,
  "linkInContainer": false,
  "ipam": {
      "type": "host-local",
      "subnet": "10.1.1.0/24"
  },
  "dns": {
      "nameservers": [ "10.1.1.1", "8.8.8.8" ]
  }
}
Configuration for an ipvlan additional network
The following object describes the configuration parameters for the IPVLAN CNI plugin:


The ipvlan object does not allow virtual interfaces to communicate with the master interface. Therefore the container is not able to reach the host by using the ipvlan interface. Be sure that the container joins a network that provides connectivity to the host, such as a network supporting the Precision Time Protocol (PTP).

A single master interface cannot simultaneously be configured to use both macvlan and ipvlan.

For IP allocation schemes that cannot be interface agnostic, the ipvlan plugin can be chained with an earlier plugin that handles this logic. If the master is omitted, then the previous result must contain a single interface name for the ipvlan plugin to enslave. If ipam is omitted, then the previous result is used to configure the ipvlan interface.
IPVLAN CNI plugin configuration example
The following example configures an additional network named ipvlan-net:

{
  "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
  "name": "ipvlan-net",
  "type": "ipvlan",
  "master": "eth1",
  "linkInContainer": false,
  "mode": "l3",
  "ipam": {
    "type": "static",
    "addresses": [
       {
         "address": "192.168.10.10/24"
       }
    ]
  }
}
Configuration for a macvlan additional network
The following object describes the configuration parameters for the MACVLAN CNI plugin:


If you specify the master key for the plugin configuration, use a different physical network interface than the one that is associated with your primary network plugin to avoid possible conflicts.
MACVLAN CNI plugin configuration example
The following example configures an additional network named macvlan-net:

{
  "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
  "name": "macvlan-net",
  "type": "macvlan",
  "master": "eth1",
  "linkInContainer": false,
  "mode": "bridge",
  "ipam": {
    "type": "dhcp"
    }
}
Configuration for a TAP additional network
The following object describes the configuration parameters for the TAP CNI plugin:


Tap configuration example
The following example configures an additional network named mynet:

{
 "name": "mynet",
 "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
 "type": "tap",
 "mac": "00:11:22:33:44:55",
 "mtu": 1500,
 "selinuxcontext": "system_u:system_r:container_t:s0",
 "multiQueue": true,
 "owner": 0,
 "group": 0
 "bridge": "br1"
}
Setting SELinux boolean for the TAP CNI plugin
To create the tap device with the container_t SELinux context, enable the container_use_devices boolean on the host by using the Machine Config Operator (MCO).

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).


Create a new YAML file named, such as setsebool-container-use-devices.yaml, with the following details:

Create the new MachineConfig object by running the following command:

Verify the change is applied by running the following command:


For more information about enabling an SELinux boolean on a node, see Setting SELinux booleans
Configuration for an OVN-Kubernetes additional network
The Red Hat OpenShift Networking OVN-Kubernetes network plugin allows the configuration of secondary network interfaces for pods. To configure secondary network interfaces, you must define the configurations in the NetworkAttachmentDefinition custom resource (CR).

Pod and multi-network policy creation might remain in a pending state until the OVN-Kubernetes control plane agent in the nodes processes the associated network-attachment-definition CR.
You can configure an OVN-Kubernetes additional network in either layer 2 or localnet topologies.

A layer 2 topology supports east-west cluster traffic, but does not allow access to the underlying physical network.

A localnet topology allows connections to the physical network, but requires additional configuration of the underlying Open vSwitch (OVS) bridge on cluster nodes.


The following sections provide example configurations for each of the topologies that OVN-Kubernetes currently allows for secondary networks.

Networks names must be unique. For example, creating multiple NetworkAttachmentDefinition CRs with different configurations that reference the same network is unsupported.
Supported platforms for OVN-Kubernetes additional network
You can use an OVN-Kubernetes additional network with the following supported platforms:

Bare metal

IBM Power(R)

IBM Z(R)

IBM(R) LinuxONE

VMware vSphere

Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP)
OVN-Kubernetes network plugin JSON configuration table
The following table describes the configuration parameters for the OVN-Kubernetes CNI network plugin:
Compatibility with multi-network policy
The multi-network policy API, which is provided by the MultiNetworkPolicy custom resource definition (CRD) in the k8s.cni.cncf.io API group, is compatible with an OVN-Kubernetes secondary network. When defining a network policy, the network policy rules that can be used depend on whether the OVN-Kubernetes secondary network defines the subnets field. Refer to the following table for details:


For example, the following multi-network policy is valid only if the subnets field is defined in the additional network CNI configuration for the additional network named blue2:

apiVersion: k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1beta1
kind: MultiNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-same-namespace
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/policy-for: blue2
spec:
  podSelector:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector: {}
The following example uses the ipBlock network policy selector, which is always valid for an OVN-Kubernetes additional network:

apiVersion: k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1beta1
kind: MultiNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name:  ingress-ipblock
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/policy-for: default/flatl2net
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      name: access-control
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: 10.200.0.0/30
Configuration for a layer 2 switched topology
The switched (layer 2) topology networks interconnect the workloads through a cluster-wide logical switch. This configuration can be used for IPv6 and dual-stack deployments.

Layer 2 switched topology networks only allow for the transfer of data packets between pods within a cluster.
The following JSON example configures a switched secondary network:

{
  "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
  "name": "l2-network",
  "type": "ovn-k8s-cni-overlay",
  "topology":"layer2",
  "subnets": "10.100.200.0/24",
  "mtu": 1300,
  "netAttachDefName": "ns1/l2-network",
  "excludeSubnets": "10.100.200.0/29"
}
Configuration for a localnet topology
The switched (localnet) topology interconnects the workloads through a cluster-wide logical switch to a physical network.

Prerequisites for configuring OVN-Kubernetes additional network
The NMState Operator is installed. For more information, see About the Kubernetes NMState Operator.
Configuration for an OVN-Kubernetes additional network mapping
You must map an additional network to the OVN bridge to use it as an OVN-Kubernetes additional network. Bridge mappings allow network traffic to reach the physical network. A bridge mapping associates a physical network name, also known as an interface label, to a bridge created with Open vSwitch (OVS).

You can create an NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy object, part of the nmstate.io/v1 API group, to declaratively create the mapping. This API is provided by the NMState Operator. By using this API you can apply the bridge mapping to nodes that match your specified nodeSelector expression, such as node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ''.

When attaching an additional network, you can either use the existing br-ex bridge or create a new bridge. Which approach to use depends on your specific network infrastructure.

If your nodes include only a single network interface, you must use the existing bridge. This network interface is owned and managed by OVN-Kubernetes and you must not remove it from the br-ex bridge or alter the interface configuration. If you remove or alter the network interface, your cluster network will stop working correctly.

If your nodes include several network interfaces, you can attach a different network interface to a new bridge, and use that for your additional network. This approach provides for traffic isolation from your primary cluster network.


The localnet1 network is mapped to the br-ex bridge in the following example:

apiVersion: nmstate.io/v1
kind: NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy
metadata:
  name: mapping 1
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: '' 2
  desiredState:
    ovn:
      bridge-mappings:
      - localnet: localnet1 3
        bridge: br-ex 4
        state: present 5
The name for the configuration object.

A node selector that specifies the nodes to apply the node network configuration policy to.

The name for the additional network from which traffic is forwarded to the OVS bridge. This additional network must match the name of the spec.config.name field of the NetworkAttachmentDefinition object that defines the OVN-Kubernetes additional network.

The name of the OVS bridge on the node. This value is required only if you specify state: present.

The state for the mapping. Must be either present to add the bridge or absent to remove the bridge. The default value is present.


In the following example, the localnet2 network interface is attached to the ovs-br1 bridge. Through this attachment, the network interface is available to the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin as an additional network.

apiVersion: nmstate.io/v1
kind: NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy
metadata:
  name: ovs-br1-multiple-networks 1
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: '' 2
  desiredState:
    interfaces:
    - name: ovs-br1 3
      description: |-
        A dedicated OVS bridge with eth1 as a port
        allowing all VLANs and untagged traffic
      type: ovs-bridge
      state: up
      bridge:
        options:
          stp: true
        port:
        - name: eth1 4
    ovn:
      bridge-mappings:
      - localnet: localnet2 5
        bridge: ovs-br1 6
        state: present 7
The name for the configuration object.

A node selector that specifies the nodes to apply the node network configuration policy to.

A new OVS bridge, separate from the default bridge used by OVN-Kubernetes for all cluster traffic.

A network device on the host system to associate with this new OVS bridge.

The name for the additional network from which traffic is forwarded to the OVS bridge. This additional network must match the name of the spec.config.name field of the NetworkAttachmentDefinition object that defines the OVN-Kubernetes additional network.

The name of the OVS bridge on the node. This value is required only if you specify state: present.

The state for the mapping. Must be either present to add the bridge or absent to remove the bridge. The default value is present.


This declarative approach is recommended because the NMState Operator applies additional network configuration to all nodes specified by the node selector automatically and transparently.

The following JSON example configures a localnet secondary network:

{
  "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
  "name": "ns1-localnet-network",
  "type": "ovn-k8s-cni-overlay",
  "topology":"localnet",
  "subnets": "202.10.130.112/28",
  "vlanID": 33,
  "mtu": 1500,
  "netAttachDefName": "ns1/localnet-network"
  "excludeSubnets": "10.100.200.0/29"
}
Configuring pods for additional networks
You must specify the secondary network attachments through the k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks annotation.

The following example provisions a pod with two secondary attachments, one for each of the attachment configurations presented in this guide.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: l2-network
  name: tinypod
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  containers:
  - args:
    - pause
    image: k8s.gcr.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.36
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    name: agnhost-container
Configuring pods with a static IP address
The following example provisions a pod with a static IP address.

You can only specify the IP address for a pod's secondary network attachment for layer 2 attachments.

Specifying a static IP address for the pod is only possible when the attachment configuration does not feature subnets.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: '[
      {
        "name": "l2-network", 1
        "mac": "02:03:04:05:06:07", 2
        "interface": "myiface1", 3
        "ips": [
          "192.0.2.20/24"
          ] 4
      }
    ]'
  name: tinypod
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  containers:
  - args:
    - pause
    image: k8s.gcr.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.36
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    name: agnhost-container
The name of the network. This value must be unique across all NetworkAttachmentDefinitions.

The MAC address to be assigned for the interface.

The name of the network interface to be created for the pod.

The IP addresses to be assigned to the network interface.
Configuration of IP address assignment for an additional network
The IP address management (IPAM) Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin provides IP addresses for other CNI plugins.

You can use the following IP address assignment types:

Static assignment.

Dynamic assignment through a DHCP server. The DHCP server you specify must be reachable from the additional network.

Dynamic assignment through the Whereabouts IPAM CNI plugin.


Static IP address assignment configuration
The following table describes the configuration for static IP address assignment:


The addresses array requires objects with the following fields:




{
  "ipam": {
    "type": "static",
      "addresses": [
        {
          "address": "191.168.1.7/24"
        }
      ]
  }
}
Dynamic IP address (DHCP) assignment configuration
The following JSON describes the configuration for dynamic IP address address assignment with DHCP.

A pod obtains its original DHCP lease when it is created. The lease must be periodically renewed by a minimal DHCP server deployment running on the cluster.

To trigger the deployment of the DHCP server, you must create a shim network attachment by editing the Cluster Network Operator configuration, as in the following example:

apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  additionalNetworks:
  - name: dhcp-shim
    namespace: default
    type: Raw
    rawCNIConfig: |-
      {
        "name": "dhcp-shim",
        "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
        "type": "bridge",
        "ipam": {
          "type": "dhcp"
        }
      }
  # ...

{
  "ipam": {
    "type": "dhcp"
  }
}
Dynamic IP address assignment configuration with Whereabouts
The Whereabouts CNI plugin allows the dynamic assignment of an IP address to an additional network without the use of a DHCP server.

The following table describes the configuration for dynamic IP address assignment with Whereabouts:


{
  "ipam": {
    "type": "whereabouts",
    "range": "192.0.2.192/27",
    "exclude": [
       "192.0.2.192/30",
       "192.0.2.196/32"
    ]
  }
}
Creating a whereabouts-reconciler daemon set
The Whereabouts reconciler is responsible for managing dynamic IP address assignments for the pods within a cluster by using the Whereabouts IP Address Management (IPAM) solution. It ensures that each pod gets a unique IP address from the specified IP address range. It also handles IP address releases when pods are deleted or scaled down.

You can also use a NetworkAttachmentDefinition custom resource (CR) for dynamic IP address assignment.
The whereabouts-reconciler daemon set is automatically created when you configure an additional network through the Cluster Network Operator. It is not automatically created when you configure an additional network from a YAML manifest.

To trigger the deployment of the whereabouts-reconciler daemon set, you must manually create a whereabouts-shim network attachment by editing the Cluster Network Operator custom resource (CR) file.

Use the following procedure to deploy the whereabouts-reconciler daemon set.

Edit the Network.operator.openshift.io custom resource (CR) by running the following command:

Include the additionalNetworks section shown in this example YAML extract within the spec definition of the custom resource (CR):

Save the file and exit the text editor.

Verify that the whereabouts-reconciler daemon set deployed successfully by running the following command:
Configuring the Whereabouts IP reconciler schedule
The Whereabouts IPAM CNI plugin runs the IP reconciler daily. This process cleans up any stranded IP allocations that might result in exhausting IPs and therefore prevent new pods from getting an IP allocated to them.

Use this procedure to change the frequency at which the IP reconciler runs.

You installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

You have deployed the whereabouts-reconciler daemon set, and the whereabouts-reconciler pods are up and running.


Run the following command to create a ConfigMap object named whereabouts-config in the openshift-multus namespace with a specific cron expression for the IP reconciler:

Retrieve information about resources related to the whereabouts-reconciler daemon set and pods within the openshift-multus namespace by running the following command:

Run the following command to verify that the whereabouts-reconciler pod runs the IP reconciler with the configured interval:
Creating a configuration for assignment of dual-stack IP addresses dynamically
Dual-stack IP address assignment can be configured with the ipRanges parameter for:

IPv4 addresses

IPv6 addresses

multiple IP address assignment


Set type to whereabouts.

Use ipRanges to allocate IP addresses as shown in the following example:

Attach network to a pod. For more information, see "Adding a pod to an additional network".

Verify that all IP addresses are assigned.

Run the following command to ensure the IP addresses are assigned as metadata.


Attaching a pod to an additional network
Creating an additional network attachment with the Cluster Network Operator
The Cluster Network Operator (CNO) manages additional network definitions. When you specify an additional network to create, the CNO creates the NetworkAttachmentDefinition object automatically.

Do not edit the NetworkAttachmentDefinition objects that the Cluster Network Operator manages. Doing so might disrupt network traffic on your additional network.
Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.


Optional: Create the namespace for the additional networks:

To edit the CNO configuration, enter the following command:

Modify the CR that you are creating by adding the configuration for the
additional network that you are creating, as in the following example CR.

Save your changes and quit the text editor to commit your changes.


Confirm that the CNO created the NetworkAttachmentDefinition object by running the following command. There might be a delay before the CNO creates the object.
Creating an additional network attachment by applying a YAML manifest
Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.


Create a YAML file with your additional network configuration, such as in the following example:

To create the additional network, enter the following command:
About configuring the master interface in the container network namespace
In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14 and later, the ability to allow users to create a MAC-VLAN, IP-VLAN, and VLAN subinterface based on a master interface in a container namespace is now generally available.

This feature allows you to create the master interfaces as part of the pod network configuration in a separate network attachment definition. You can then base the VLAN, MACVLAN, or IPVLAN on this interface without requiring the knowledge of the network configuration of the node.

To ensure the use of a container namespace master interface, specify the linkInContainer and set the value to true in the VLAN, MACVLAN, or IPVLAN plugin configuration depending on the particular type of additional network.

Creating multiple VLANs on SR-IOV VFs
An example use case for utilizing this feature is to create multiple VLANs based on SR-IOV VFs. To do so, begin by creating an SR-IOV network and then define the network attachments for the VLAN interfaces.

The following example shows how to configure the setup illustrated in this diagram.


You installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

You have installed the SR-IOV Network Operator.


Create a dedicated container namespace where you want to deploy your pod by using the following command:

Create an SR-IOV node policy:
