# Additional networks in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform



You can use the following Container Network Interface (CNI) plugins for creating additional networks in your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

* bridge: Configure a bridge-based additional network
to allow pods on the same host to communicate with each other and the host.
* bond-cni: Configure a Bond CNI secondary network to provide a method for aggregating multiple network interfaces into a single logical bonded interface.
* host-device: Configure a host-device additional network to allow pods access to a physical Ethernet network device on the host system.
* ipvlan: Configure an ipvlan-based additional network to allow pods on a host to communicate with other hosts and pods on those hosts, similar to a macvlan-based additional network. Unlike a macvlan-based additional network, each pod shares the same MAC address as the parent physical network interface.
* vlan: Configure a vlan-based additional network to allow VLAN-based network isolation and connectivity for pods.
* macvlan: Configure a macvlan-based additional network to allow pods on a host to communicate with other hosts and pods on those hosts by using a physical network interface. Each pod that is attached to a macvlan-based additional network is provided a unique MAC address.
* TAP: Configure a tap-based additional network to create a tap device inside the container namespace. A tap device enables user space programs to send and receive network packets.
* SR-IOV: Configure an SR-IOV based additional network to allow pods to attach to a virtual function (VF) interface on SR-IOV capable hardware on the host system.
* route-override: Configure a route-override based additional network to allow pods to override and set routes.
