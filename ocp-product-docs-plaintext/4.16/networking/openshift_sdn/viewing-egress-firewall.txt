# Editing an egress firewall for a project


As a cluster administrator, you can modify network traffic rules for an existing egress firewall.

# Viewing an EgressNetworkPolicy custom resource (CR)

You can view an EgressNetworkPolicy CR in your cluster.

* A cluster using the OpenShift SDN network plugin.
* Install the OpenShift Command-line Interface (CLI), commonly known as oc.
* You must log in to the cluster.

1. Optional: To view the names of the EgressNetworkPolicy CRs defined in your cluster, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get egressnetworkpolicy --all-namespaces
```

2. To inspect a policy, enter the following command. Replace <policy_name> with the name of the policy to inspect.

```terminal
$ oc describe egressnetworkpolicy <policy_name>
```

Example output

```terminal
