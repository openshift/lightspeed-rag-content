# Deleting a network policy


As a cluster administrator, you can delete a network policy from a namespace.

# Deleting a network policy using the CLI

You can delete a {name} policy in a namespace.


[NOTE]
----
If you log in with a user with the cluster-admin role, then you can delete any network policy in the cluster.
----

* Your cluster uses a network plugin that supports NetworkPolicy objects, such as the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin or the OpenShift SDN network plugin with mode: NetworkPolicy set. This mode is the default for OpenShift SDN.
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You logged in to the cluster with a user with {role} privileges.
* You are working in the namespace where the {name} policy exists.

* To delete a {name} policy object, enter the following command. Successful output lists the name of the policy object and the deleted status.

```terminal
$ oc delete {name}policy <policy_name> -n <namespace>
```


where:
<policy_name>:: Specifies the name of the {name} policy.
<namespace>:: Optional parameter. If you defined the object in a different namespace than the current namespace, the parameter specifices the namespace.


[NOTE]
----
If you log in to the web console with cluster-admin privileges, you have a choice of deleting a network policy in any namespace in the cluster directly in YAML or from the policy in the web console through the Actions menu.
