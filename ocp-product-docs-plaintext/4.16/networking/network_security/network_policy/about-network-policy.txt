# About network policy


As a developer, you can define network policies that restrict traffic to pods in your cluster.

# About network policy

In a cluster that uses a network plugin that supports a Kubernetes network policy, a NetworkPolicy object controls network isolation. In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, OpenShift SDN supports using network policy in its default network isolation mode.


[WARNING]
----
* On OpenShift SDN: A network policy does not apply to the host network namespace. Network policy rules do not impact pods configured with host networking enabled. Network policy rules might impact pods connected to host-networked pods.
* On Openshift-OVN-Kubernetes: Network policies do impact pods that have host networking enabled, so you must explicitly allow a connection to these pods in your network policy rules. If a namespace has any network policy applied, traffic originating from system components, such as openshift-ingress or openshift-kube-apiserver, get dropped by default; You must explicitly enable this traffic to allow it through.
* Using the namespaceSelector field without the podSelector field set to {} will not include hostNetwork pods. You must use the podSelector set to {} with the namespaceSelector field in order to target hostNetwork pods when creating network policies.
* Network policies cannot block traffic from localhost or from their resident nodes.
----

By default, all pods in a project are accessible from other pods and network endpoints. To isolate one or more pods in a project, you can create NetworkPolicy objects in that project to indicate the allowed incoming connections. Project administrators can create and delete NetworkPolicy objects within their own project.

If a pod is matched by selectors in one or more NetworkPolicy objects, then the pod will accept only connections that are allowed by at least one of those NetworkPolicy objects. A pod that is not selected by any NetworkPolicy objects is fully accessible.

A network policy applies to only the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), and Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) protocols. Other protocols are not affected.

The following example NetworkPolicy objects demonstrate supporting different scenarios:

* Deny all traffic:

To make a project deny by default, add a NetworkPolicy object that matches all pods but accepts no traffic:

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: deny-by-default
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  ingress: []
```

* Only allow connections from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Ingress Controller:

To make a project allow only connections from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Ingress Controller, add the following NetworkPolicy object.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-from-openshift-ingress
spec:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          policy-group.network.openshift.io/ingress: ""
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
```

* Only accept connections from pods within a project:

[IMPORTANT]
----
To allow ingress connections from hostNetwork pods in the same namespace, you need to apply the allow-from-hostnetwork policy together with the allow-same-namespace policy.
----

To make pods accept connections from other pods in the same project, but reject all other connections from pods in other projects, add the following NetworkPolicy object:

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-same-namespace
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector: {}
```

* Only allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic based on pod labels:

To enable only HTTP and HTTPS access to the pods with a specific label (role=frontend in following example), add a NetworkPolicy object similar to the following:

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-http-and-https
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: frontend
  ingress:
  - ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 443
```

* Accept connections by using both namespace and pod selectors:

To match network traffic by combining namespace and pod selectors, you can use a NetworkPolicy object similar to the following:

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-pod-and-namespace-both
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      name: test-pods
  ingress:
    - from:
      - namespaceSelector:
          matchLabels:
            project: project_name
        podSelector:
          matchLabels:
            name: test-pods
```


NetworkPolicy objects are additive, which means you can combine multiple NetworkPolicy objects together to satisfy complex network requirements.

For example, for the NetworkPolicy objects defined in previous samples, you can define both allow-same-namespace and allow-http-and-https policies within the same project. Thus allowing the pods with the label role=frontend, to accept any connection allowed by each policy. That is, connections on any port from pods in the same namespace, and connections on ports 80 and 443 from pods in any namespace.

## Using the allow-from-router network policy

Use the following NetworkPolicy to allow external traffic regardless of the router configuration:


```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-from-router
spec:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          policy-group.network.openshift.io/ingress: ""1
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
```


policy-group.network.openshift.io/ingress:"" label supports both OpenShift-SDN and OVN-Kubernetes.

## Using the allow-from-hostnetwork network policy

Add the following allow-from-hostnetwork NetworkPolicy object to direct traffic from the host network pods.


```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-from-hostnetwork
spec:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          policy-group.network.openshift.io/host-network: ""
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
```


# Optimizations for network policy with OpenShift SDN

Use a network policy to isolate pods that are differentiated from one another by labels within a namespace.

It is inefficient to apply NetworkPolicy objects to large numbers of individual pods in a single namespace. Pod labels do not exist at the IP address level, so a network policy generates a separate Open vSwitch (OVS) flow rule for every possible link between every pod selected with a podSelector.

For example, if the spec podSelector and the ingress podSelector within a NetworkPolicy object each match 200 pods, then 40,000 (200*200) OVS flow rules are generated. This might slow down a node.

When designing your network policy, refer to the following guidelines:

* Reduce the number of OVS flow rules by using namespaces to contain groups of pods that need to be isolated.

NetworkPolicy objects that select a whole namespace, by using the namespaceSelector or an empty podSelector, generate only a single OVS flow rule that matches the VXLAN virtual network ID (VNID) of the namespace.
* Keep the pods that do not need to be isolated in their original namespace, and move the pods that require isolation into one or more different namespaces.
* Create additional targeted cross-namespace network policies to allow the specific traffic that you do want to allow from the isolated pods.

# Optimizations for network policy with OVN-Kubernetes network plugin

When designing your network policy, refer to the following guidelines:

* For network policies with the same spec.podSelector spec, it is more efficient to use one network policy with multiple ingress or egress rules, than multiple network policies with subsets of ingress or egress rules.
* Every ingress or egress rule based on the podSelector or namespaceSelector spec generates the number of OVS flows proportional to number of pods selected by network policy + number of pods selected by ingress or egress rule. Therefore, it is preferable to use the podSelector or namespaceSelector spec that can select as many pods as you need in one rule, instead of creating individual rules for every pod.

For example, the following policy contains two rules:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: test-network-policy
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          role: frontend
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          role: backend
```


The following policy expresses those same two rules as one:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: test-network-policy
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchExpressions:
        - {key: role, operator: In, values: [frontend, backend]}
```


The same guideline applies to the spec.podSelector spec. If you have the same ingress or egress rules for different network policies, it might be more efficient to create one network policy with a common spec.podSelector spec. For example, the following two policies have different rules:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: policy1
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: db
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          role: frontend
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: policy2
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: client
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          role: frontend
```


The following network policy expresses those same two rules as one:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: policy3
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchExpressions:
    - {key: role, operator: In, values: [db, client]}
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          role: frontend
```


You can apply this optimization when only multiple selectors are expressed as one. In cases where selectors are based on different labels, it may not be possible to apply this optimization. In those cases, consider applying some new labels for network policy optimization specifically.

## NetworkPolicy CR and external IPs in OVN-Kubernetes

In OVN-Kubernetes, the NetworkPolicy custom resource (CR) enforces strict isolation rules. If a service is exposed using an external IP, a network policy can block access from other namespaces unless explicitly configured to allow traffic.

To allow access to external IPs across namespaces, create a NetworkPolicy CR that explicitly permits ingress from the required namespaces and ensures traffic is allowed to the designated service ports. Without allowing traffic to the required ports, access might still be restricted.


```yaml
  apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: NetworkPolicy
  metadata:
    annotations:
    name: <policy_name>
    namespace: openshift-ingress
  spec:
    ingress:
    - ports:
      - port: 80
        protocol: TCP
    - ports:
      - port: 443
        protocol: TCP
    - from:
      - namespaceSelector:
          matchLabels:
          kubernetes.io/metadata.name: <my_namespace>
    podSelector: {}
    policyTypes:
    - Ingress
```


where:

<policy_name>:: Specifies your name for the policy.
<my_namespace>:: Specifies the name of the namespace where the policy is deployed.
