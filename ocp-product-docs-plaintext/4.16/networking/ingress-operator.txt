Ingress Operator in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Ingress Operator
When you create your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, pods and services running on the cluster are each allocated their own IP addresses. The IP addresses are accessible to other pods and services running nearby but are not accessible to outside clients. The Ingress Operator implements the IngressController API and is the component responsible for enabling external access to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster services.

The Ingress Operator makes it possible for external clients to access your service by deploying and managing one or more HAProxy-based Ingress Controllers to handle routing. You can use the Ingress Operator to route traffic by specifying Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Route and Kubernetes Ingress resources. Configurations within the Ingress Controller, such as the ability to define endpointPublishingStrategy type and internal load balancing, provide ways to publish Ingress Controller endpoints.
The Ingress configuration asset
The installation program generates an asset with an Ingress resource in the config.openshift.io API group, cluster-ingress-02-config.yml.

apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  domain: apps.openshiftdemos.com
The installation program stores this asset in the cluster-ingress-02-config.yml file in the manifests/ directory. This Ingress resource defines the cluster-wide configuration for Ingress. This Ingress configuration is used as follows:

The Ingress Operator uses the domain from the cluster Ingress configuration as the domain for the default Ingress Controller.

The OpenShift API Server Operator uses the domain from the cluster Ingress configuration. This domain is also used when generating a default host for a Route resource that does not specify an explicit host.
Ingress Controller configuration parameters
The ingresscontrollers.operator.openshift.io resource offers the following configuration parameters.


All parameters are optional.
Ingress Controller TLS security profiles
TLS security profiles provide a way for servers to regulate which ciphers a connecting client can use when connecting to the server.

Understanding TLS security profiles
You can use a TLS (Transport Layer Security) security profile to define which TLS ciphers are required by various Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform components. The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform TLS security profiles are based on Mozilla recommended configurations.

You can specify one of the following TLS security profiles for each component:


When using one of the predefined profile types, the effective profile configuration is subject to change between releases. For example, given a specification to use the Intermediate profile deployed on release X.Y.Z, an upgrade to release X.Y.Z+1 might cause a new profile configuration to be applied, resulting in a rollout.
Configuring the TLS security profile for the Ingress Controller
To configure a TLS security profile for an Ingress Controller, edit the IngressController custom resource (CR) to specify a predefined or custom TLS security profile. If a TLS security profile is not configured, the default value is based on the TLS security profile set for the API server.

apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: IngressController
 ...
spec:
  tlsSecurityProfile:
    old: {}
    type: Old
 ...
The TLS security profile defines the minimum TLS version and the TLS ciphers for TLS connections for Ingress Controllers.

You can see the ciphers and the minimum TLS version of the configured TLS security profile in the IngressController custom resource (CR) under Status.Tls Profile and the configured TLS security profile under Spec.Tls Security Profile. For the Custom TLS security profile, the specific ciphers and minimum TLS version are listed under both parameters.

The HAProxy Ingress Controller image supports TLS 1.3 and the Modern profile.

The Ingress Operator also converts the TLS 1.0 of an Old or Custom profile to 1.1.
You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.


Edit the IngressController CR in the openshift-ingress-operator project to configure the TLS security profile:

Add the spec.tlsSecurityProfile field:

Save the file to apply the changes.


Verify that the profile is set in the IngressController CR:
Configuring mutual TLS authentication
You can configure the Ingress Controller to enable mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication by setting a spec.clientTLS value. The clientTLS value configures the Ingress Controller to verify client certificates. This configuration includes setting a clientCA value, which is a reference to a config map. The config map contains the PEM-encoded CA certificate bundle that is used to verify a client's certificate. Optionally, you can also configure a list of certificate subject filters.

If the clientCA value specifies an X509v3 certificate revocation list (CRL) distribution point, the Ingress Operator downloads and manages a CRL config map based on the HTTP URI X509v3 CRL Distribution Point specified in each provided certificate. The Ingress Controller uses this config map during mTLS/TLS negotiation. Requests that do not provide valid certificates are rejected.

You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

You have a PEM-encoded CA certificate bundle.

If your CA bundle references a CRL distribution point, you must have also included the end-entity or leaf certificate to the client CA bundle. This certificate must have included an HTTP URI under CRL Distribution Points, as described in RFC 5280. For example:


In the openshift-config namespace, create a config map from your CA bundle:

Edit the IngressController resource in the openshift-ingress-operator project:

Add the spec.clientTLS field and subfields to configure mutual TLS:
View the default Ingress Controller
The Ingress Operator is a core feature of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and is enabled out of the box.

Every new Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation has an ingresscontroller named default. It can be supplemented with additional Ingress Controllers. If the default ingresscontroller is deleted, the Ingress Operator will automatically recreate it within a minute.

Configuring the Ingress Controller
Setting a custom default certificate
As an administrator, you can configure an Ingress Controller to use a custom certificate by creating a Secret resource and editing the IngressController custom resource (CR).

You must have a certificate/key pair in PEM-encoded files, where the
certificate is signed by a trusted certificate authority or by a private trusted
certificate authority that you configured in a custom PKI.

Your certificate meets the following requirements:

You must have an IngressController CR. You may use the default one:


If you have intermediate certificates, they must be included in the tls.crt file of the secret containing a custom default certificate. Order matters when specifying a certificate; list your intermediate certificate(s) after any server certificate(s).
The following assumes that the custom certificate and key pair are in the tls.crt and tls.key files in the current working directory. Substitute the actual path names for tls.crt and tls.key. You also may substitute another name for custom-certs-default when creating the Secret resource and referencing it in the IngressController CR.

This action will cause the Ingress Controller to be redeployed, using a rolling deployment strategy.
Create a Secret resource containing the custom certificate in the
openshift-ingress namespace using the tls.crt and tls.key files.

Update the IngressController CR to reference the new certificate secret:

Verify the update was effective:


Once the IngressController CR has been modified, the Ingress Operator updates the Ingress Controller's deployment to use the custom certificate.
Removing a custom default certificate
As an administrator, you can remove a custom certificate that you configured an Ingress Controller to use.

You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You previously configured a custom default certificate for the Ingress Controller.


To remove the custom certificate and restore the certificate that ships with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, enter the following command:


To confirm that the original cluster certificate is restored, enter the following command:
Autoscaling an Ingress Controller
Automatically scale an Ingress Controller to dynamically meet routing performance or availability requirements such as the requirement to increase throughput. The following procedure provides an example for scaling up the default IngressController.

You have the OpenShift CLI (oc) installed.

You have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

You have the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator installed.

You are in the openshift-ingress-operator project namespace.


Create a service account to authenticate with Thanos by running the following command:

Define a TriggerAuthentication object within the openshift-ingress-operator namespace using the service account's token.

Create and apply a role for reading metrics from Thanos:

Add the new role to the service account by entering the following commands:

Create a new ScaledObject YAML file, ingress-autoscaler.yaml, that targets the default Ingress Controller deployment:

Apply the custom resource definition by running the following command:


Verify that the default Ingress Controller is scaled out to match the value returned by the kube-state-metrics query by running the following commands:

that you specified:
Configuring Ingress access logging
You can configure the Ingress Controller to enable access logs. If you have clusters that do not receive much traffic, then you can log to a sidecar. If you have high traffic clusters, to avoid exceeding the capacity of the logging stack or  to integrate with a logging infrastructure outside of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, you can forward logs to a custom syslog endpoint. You can also specify the format for access logs.

Container logging is useful to enable access logs on low-traffic clusters when there is no existing Syslog logging infrastructure, or for short-term use while diagnosing problems with the Ingress Controller.

Syslog is needed for high-traffic clusters where access logs could exceed the OpenShift Logging stack's capacity, or for environments where any logging solution needs to integrate with an existing Syslog logging infrastructure. The Syslog use-cases can overlap.

Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.


Configure Ingress access logging to a sidecar.

To configure Ingress access logging, you must specify a destination using spec.logging.access.destination. To specify logging to a sidecar container, you must specify Container spec.logging.access.destination.type. The following example is an Ingress Controller definition that logs to a Container destination:

When you configure the Ingress Controller to log to a sidecar, the operator creates a container named logs inside the Ingress Controller Pod:


Configure Ingress access logging to a Syslog endpoint.

To configure Ingress access logging, you must specify a destination using spec.logging.access.destination. To specify logging to a Syslog endpoint destination, you must specify Syslog for spec.logging.access.destination.type. If the destination type is Syslog, you must also specify a destination endpoint using spec.logging.access.destination.syslog.endpoint and you can specify a facility using spec.logging.access.destination.syslog.facility. The following example is an Ingress Controller definition that logs to a Syslog destination:


Configure Ingress access logging with a specific log format.

You can specify spec.logging.access.httpLogFormat to customize the log format. The following example is an Ingress Controller definition that logs to a syslog endpoint with IP address 1.2.3.4 and port 10514:


Disable Ingress access logging.

To disable Ingress access logging, leave spec.logging or spec.logging.access empty:


Allow the Ingress Controller to modify the HAProxy log length when using a sidecar.

Use spec.logging.access.destination.syslog.maxLength if you are using spec.logging.access.destination.type: Syslog.

Use spec.logging.access.destination.container.maxLength if you are using spec.logging.access.destination.type: Container.
Setting Ingress Controller thread count
A cluster administrator can set the thread count to increase the amount of incoming connections a cluster can handle. You can patch an existing Ingress Controller to increase the amount of threads.

The following assumes that you already created an Ingress Controller.


Update the Ingress Controller to increase the number of threads:
Configuring an Ingress Controller to use an internal load balancer
When creating an Ingress Controller on cloud platforms, the Ingress Controller is published by a public cloud load balancer by default. As an administrator, you can create an Ingress Controller that uses an internal cloud load balancer.

If your cloud provider is Microsoft Azure, you must have at least one public load balancer that points to your nodes. If you do not, all of your nodes will lose egress connectivity to the internet.
If you want to change the scope for an IngressController, you can change the .spec.endpointPublishingStrategy.loadBalancer.scope parameter after the custom resource (CR) is created.

The preceding graphic shows the following concepts pertaining to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Ingress LoadBalancerService endpoint publishing strategy:

You can load balance externally, using the cloud provider load balancer, or internally, using the OpenShift Ingress Controller Load Balancer.

You can use the single IP address of the load balancer and more familiar ports, such as 8080 and 4200 as shown on the cluster depicted in the graphic.

Traffic from the external load balancer is directed at the pods, and managed by the load balancer, as depicted in the instance of a down node.
See the Kubernetes Services documentation
for implementation details.


Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.


Create an IngressController custom resource (CR) in a file named <name>-ingress-controller.yaml, such as in the following example:

Create the Ingress Controller defined in the previous step by running the following command:

Optional: Confirm that the Ingress Controller was created by running the following command:
Configuring global access for an Ingress Controller on GCP
An Ingress Controller created on GCP with an internal load balancer generates an internal IP address for the service. A cluster administrator can specify the global access option, which enables clients in any region within the same VPC network and compute region as the load balancer, to reach the workloads running on your cluster.

For more information, see the GCP documentation for global access.

You deployed an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on GCP infrastructure.

You configured an Ingress Controller to use an internal load balancer.

You installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).


Configure the Ingress Controller resource to allow global access.

Run the following command to verify that the service allows global access:
Setting the Ingress Controller health check interval
A cluster administrator can set the health check interval to define how long the router waits between two consecutive health checks. This value is applied globally as a default for all routes. The default value is 5 seconds.

The following assumes that you already created an Ingress Controller.


Update the Ingress Controller to change the interval between back end health checks:
Configuring the default Ingress Controller for your cluster to be internal
You can configure the default Ingress Controller for your cluster to be internal by deleting and recreating it.

If your cloud provider is Microsoft Azure, you must have at least one public load balancer that points to your nodes. If you do not, all of your nodes will lose egress connectivity to the internet.
If you want to change the scope for an IngressController, you can change the .spec.endpointPublishingStrategy.loadBalancer.scope parameter after the custom resource (CR) is created.
Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.


Configure the default Ingress Controller for your cluster to be internal by deleting and recreating it.
Configuring the route admission policy
Administrators and application developers can run applications in multiple namespaces with the same domain name. This is for organizations where multiple teams develop microservices that are exposed on the same hostname.

Allowing claims across namespaces should only be enabled for clusters with trust between namespaces, otherwise a malicious user could take over a hostname. For this reason, the default admission policy disallows hostname claims across namespaces.
Cluster administrator privileges.


Edit the .spec.routeAdmission field of the ingresscontroller resource variable using the following command:
Using wildcard routes
The HAProxy Ingress Controller has support for wildcard routes. The Ingress Operator uses wildcardPolicy to configure the ROUTER_ALLOW_WILDCARD_ROUTES environment variable of the Ingress Controller.

The default behavior of the Ingress Controller is to admit routes with a wildcard policy of None, which is backwards compatible with existing IngressController resources.

Configure the wildcard policy.
HTTP header configuration
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform provides different methods for working with HTTP headers. When setting or deleting headers, you can use specific fields in the Ingress Controller or an individual route to modify request and response headers. You can also set certain headers by using route annotations. The various ways of configuring headers can present challenges when working together.

You can only set or delete headers within an IngressController or Route CR, you cannot append them. If an HTTP header is set with a value, that value must be complete and not require appending in the future. In situations where it makes sense to append a header, such as the X-Forwarded-For header, use the spec.httpHeaders.forwardedHeaderPolicy field, instead of spec.httpHeaders.actions.
Order of precedence
When the same HTTP header is modified both in the Ingress Controller and in a route, HAProxy prioritizes the actions in certain ways depending on whether it is a request or response header.

For HTTP response headers, actions specified in the Ingress Controller are executed after the actions specified in a route. This means that the actions specified in the Ingress Controller take precedence.

For HTTP request headers, actions specified in a route are executed after the actions specified in the Ingress Controller. This means that the actions specified in the route take precedence.


For example, a cluster administrator sets the X-Frame-Options response header with the value DENY in the Ingress Controller using the following configuration:

apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: IngressController
# ...
spec:
  httpHeaders:
    actions:
      response:
      - name: X-Frame-Options
        action:
          type: Set
          set:
            value: DENY
A route owner sets the same response header that the cluster administrator set in the Ingress Controller, but with the value SAMEORIGIN using the following configuration:

apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
# ...
spec:
  httpHeaders:
    actions:
      response:
      - name: X-Frame-Options
        action:
          type: Set
          set:
            value: SAMEORIGIN
When both the IngressController spec and Route spec are configuring the X-Frame-Options header, then the value set for this header at the global level in the Ingress Controller will take precedence, even if a specific route allows frames.

This prioritzation occurs because the haproxy.config file uses the following logic, where the Ingress Controller is considered the front end and individual routes are considered the back end. The header value DENY applied to the front end configurations overrides the same header with the value SAMEORIGIN that is set in the back end:

frontend public
  http-response set-header X-Frame-Options 'DENY'

frontend fe_sni
  http-response set-header X-Frame-Options 'DENY'

frontend fe_no_sni
  http-response set-header X-Frame-Options 'DENY'

backend be_secure:openshift-monitoring:alertmanager-main
  http-response set-header X-Frame-Options 'SAMEORIGIN'
Additionally, any actions defined in either the Ingress Controller or a route override values set using route annotations.
Special case headers
The following headers are either prevented entirely from being set or deleted, or allowed under specific circumstances:
Setting or deleting HTTP request and response headers in an Ingress Controller
You can set or delete certain HTTP request and response headers for compliance purposes or other reasons. You can set or delete these headers either for all routes served by an Ingress Controller or for specific routes.

For example, you might want to migrate an application running on your cluster to use mutual TLS, which requires that your application checks for an X-Forwarded-Client-Cert request header, but the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform default Ingress Controller provides an X-SSL-Client-Der request header.

The following procedure modifies the Ingress Controller to set the X-Forwarded-Client-Cert request header, and delete the X-SSL-Client-Der request header.

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.


Edit the Ingress Controller resource:

Replace the X-SSL-Client-Der HTTP request header with the X-Forwarded-Client-Cert HTTP request header:

Save the file to apply the changes.
Using X-Forwarded headers
You configure the HAProxy Ingress Controller to specify a policy for how to handle HTTP headers including Forwarded and X-Forwarded-For. The Ingress Operator uses the HTTPHeaders field to configure the ROUTER_SET_FORWARDED_HEADERS environment variable of the Ingress Controller.

Configure the HTTPHeaders field for the Ingress Controller.



As a cluster administrator, you can:

Configure an external proxy that injects the X-Forwarded-For header into each request before forwarding it to an Ingress Controller.

Configure the Ingress Controller to pass the X-Forwarded-For header that your external proxy sets on external cluster requests through unmodified.


As an application developer, you can:

Configure an application-specific external proxy that injects the X-Forwarded-For header.
Enabling HTTP/2 Ingress connectivity
You can enable transparent end-to-end HTTP/2 connectivity in HAProxy. It allows application owners to make use of HTTP/2 protocol capabilities, including single connection, header compression, binary streams, and more.

You can enable HTTP/2 connectivity for an individual Ingress Controller or for the entire cluster.

To enable the use of HTTP/2 for the connection from the client to HAProxy, a route must specify a custom certificate. A route that uses the default certificate cannot use HTTP/2. This restriction is necessary to avoid problems from connection coalescing, where the client re-uses a connection for different routes that use the same certificate.

The connection from HAProxy to the application pod can use HTTP/2 only for re-encrypt routes and not for edge-terminated or insecure routes. This restriction is because HAProxy uses Application-Level Protocol Negotiation (ALPN), which is a TLS extension, to negotiate the use of HTTP/2 with the back-end. The implication is that end-to-end HTTP/2 is possible with passthrough and re-encrypt and not with insecure or edge-terminated routes.

For non-passthrough routes, the Ingress Controller negotiates its connection to the application independently of the connection from the client. This means a client may connect to the Ingress Controller and negotiate HTTP/1.1, and the Ingress Controller may then connect to the application, negotiate HTTP/2, and forward the request from the client HTTP/1.1 connection using the HTTP/2 connection to the application. This poses a problem if the client subsequently tries to upgrade its connection from HTTP/1.1 to the WebSocket protocol, because the Ingress Controller cannot forward WebSocket to HTTP/2 and cannot upgrade its HTTP/2 connection to WebSocket. Consequently, if you have an application that is intended to accept WebSocket connections, it must not allow negotiating the HTTP/2 protocol or else clients will fail to upgrade to the WebSocket protocol.
Enable HTTP/2 on a single Ingress Controller.

To enable HTTP/2 on an Ingress Controller, enter the oc annotate command:


Enable HTTP/2 on the entire cluster.

To enable HTTP/2 for the entire cluster, enter the oc annotate command:
Configuring the PROXY protocol for an Ingress Controller
A cluster administrator can configure the PROXY protocol when an Ingress Controller uses either the HostNetwork or NodePortService endpoint publishing strategy types. The PROXY protocol enables the load balancer to preserve the original client addresses for connections that the Ingress Controller receives. The original client addresses are useful for logging, filtering, and injecting HTTP headers. In the default configuration, the connections that the Ingress Controller receives only contain the source address that is associated with the load balancer.

This feature is not supported in cloud deployments. This restriction is because when Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform runs in a cloud platform, and an IngressController specifies that a service load balancer should be used, the Ingress Operator configures the load balancer service and enables the PROXY protocol based on the platform requirement for preserving source addresses.

You must configure both Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and the external load balancer to either use the PROXY protocol or to use TCP.
The PROXY protocol is unsupported for the default Ingress Controller with installer-provisioned clusters on non-cloud platforms that use a Keepalived Ingress VIP.
You created an Ingress Controller.


Edit the Ingress Controller resource:

Set the PROXY configuration:
Specifying an alternative cluster domain using the appsDomain option
As a cluster administrator, you can specify an alternative to the default cluster domain for user-created routes by configuring the appsDomain field. The appsDomain field is an optional domain for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform to use instead of the default, which is specified in the domain field. If you specify an alternative domain, it overrides the default cluster domain for the purpose of determining the default host for a new route.

For example, you can use the DNS domain for your company as the default domain for routes and ingresses for applications running on your cluster.

You deployed an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

You installed the oc command line interface.


Configure the appsDomain field by specifying an alternative default domain for user-created routes.

Verify that an existing route contains the domain name specified in the appsDomain field by exposing the route and verifying the route domain change:
Converting HTTP header case
HAProxy lowercases HTTP header names by default, for example, changing Host: xyz.com to host: xyz.com. If legacy applications are sensitive to the capitalization of HTTP header names, use the Ingress Controller spec.httpHeaders.headerNameCaseAdjustments API field for a solution to accommodate legacy applications until they can be fixed.

Because Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform includes HAProxy 2.8, be sure to add the necessary configuration by using spec.httpHeaders.headerNameCaseAdjustments before upgrading.
You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.


As a cluster administrator, you can convert the HTTP header case by entering the oc patch command or by setting the HeaderNameCaseAdjustments field in the Ingress Controller YAML file.

Specify an HTTP header to be capitalized by entering the oc patch command.


Specify adjustments using the HeaderNameCaseAdjustments field by configuring the Ingress Controller YAML file.
Using router compression
You configure the HAProxy Ingress Controller to specify router compression globally for specific MIME types. You can use the mimeTypes variable to define the formats of MIME types to which compression is applied. The types are: application, image, message, multipart, text, video, or a custom type prefaced by "X-". To see the full notation for MIME types and subtypes, see RFC1341.

Memory allocated for compression can affect the max connections. Additionally, compression of large buffers can cause latency, like heavy regex or long lists of regex.

Not all MIME types benefit from compression, but HAProxy still uses resources to try to compress if instructed to.  Generally, text formats, such as html, css, and js, formats benefit from compression, but formats that are already compressed, such as image, audio, and video, benefit little in exchange for the time and resources spent on compression.
Configure the httpCompression field for the Ingress Controller.
Exposing router metrics
You can expose the HAProxy router metrics by default in Prometheus format on the default stats port, 1936. The external metrics collection and aggregation systems such as Prometheus can access the HAProxy router metrics. You can view the HAProxy router metrics in a browser in the HTML and comma separated values (CSV) format.

You configured your firewall to access the default stats port, 1936.


Get the router pod name by running the following command:

Get the router's username and password, which the router pod stores in the /var/lib/haproxy/conf/metrics-auth/statsUsername and /var/lib/haproxy/conf/metrics-auth/statsPassword files:

Get the router IP and metrics certificates by running the following command:

Get the raw statistics in Prometheus format by running the following command:

Access the metrics securely by running the following command:

Access the default stats port, 1936, by running the following command:

Launch the stats window by entering the following URL in a browser:

Optional: Get the stats in CSV format by entering the following URL in a browser:
Customizing HAProxy error code response pages
As a cluster administrator, you can specify a custom error code response page for either 503, 404, or both error pages. The HAProxy router serves a 503 error page when the application pod is not running or a 404 error page when the requested URL does not exist. For example, if you customize the 503 error code response page, then the page is served when the application pod is not running, and the default 404 error code HTTP response page is served by the HAProxy router for an incorrect route or a non-existing route.

Custom error code response pages are specified in a config map then patched to the Ingress Controller. The config map keys have two available file names as follows: error-page-503.http and error-page-404.http.

Custom HTTP error code response pages must follow the HAProxy HTTP error page configuration guidelines. Here is an example of the default Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform HAProxy router http 503 error code response page. You can use the default content as a template for creating your own custom page.

By default, the HAProxy router serves only a 503 error page when the application is not running or when the route is incorrect or non-existent. This default behavior is the same as the behavior on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.8 and earlier. If a config map for the customization of an HTTP error code response is not provided, and you are using a custom HTTP error code response page, the router serves a default 404 or 503 error code response page.

If you use the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform default 503 error code page as a template for your customizations, the headers in the file require an editor that can use CRLF line endings.
Create a config map named my-custom-error-code-pages in the openshift-config namespace:

Patch the Ingress Controller to reference the my-custom-error-code-pages config map by name:

Display the copy:

Confirm that the config map containing the custom error response page mounts on the router volume where the config map key is the filename that has the custom HTTP error code response:


Verify your custom error code HTTP response:

Create a test project and application:

For 503 custom http error code response:

For 404 custom http error code response:

Check if the errorfile attribute is properly in the haproxy.config file:
Setting the Ingress Controller maximum connections
A cluster administrator can set the maximum number of simultaneous connections for OpenShift router deployments. You can patch an existing Ingress Controller to increase the maximum number of connections.

The following assumes that you already created an Ingress Controller
