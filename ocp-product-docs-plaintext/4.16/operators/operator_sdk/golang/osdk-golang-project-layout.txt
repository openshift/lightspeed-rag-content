# Project layout for Go-based Operators


The operator-sdk CLI can generate, or scaffold, a number of packages and files for each Operator project.

[IMPORTANT]
----
The Red Hat-supported version of the Operator SDK CLI tool, including the related scaffolding and testing tools for Operator projects, is deprecated and is planned to be removed in a future release of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. Red Hat will provide bug fixes and support for this feature during the current release lifecycle, but this feature will no longer receive enhancements and will be removed from future Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform releases.
The Red Hat-supported version of the Operator SDK is not recommended for creating new Operator projects. Operator authors with existing Operator projects can use the version of the Operator SDK CLI tool released with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 to maintain their projects and create Operator releases targeting newer versions of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
The following related base images for Operator projects are not deprecated. The runtime functionality and configuration APIs for these base images are still supported for bug fixes and for addressing CVEs.
* The base image for Ansible-based Operator projects
* The base image for Helm-based Operator projects
For the most recent list of major functionality that has been deprecated or removed within Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, refer to the Deprecated and removed features section of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release notes.
For information about the unsupported, community-maintained, version of the Operator SDK, see Operator SDK (Operator Framework).
