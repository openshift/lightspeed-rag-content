# Operator SDK tutorial for Go-based Operators


Operator developers can take advantage of Go programming language support in the Operator SDK to build an example Go-based Operator for Memcached, a distributed key-value store, and manage its lifecycle.

[IMPORTANT]
----
The Red Hat-supported version of the Operator SDK CLI tool, including the related scaffolding and testing tools for Operator projects, is deprecated and is planned to be removed in a future release of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. Red Hat will provide bug fixes and support for this feature during the current release lifecycle, but this feature will no longer receive enhancements and will be removed from future Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform releases.
The Red Hat-supported version of the Operator SDK is not recommended for creating new Operator projects. Operator authors with existing Operator projects can use the version of the Operator SDK CLI tool released with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 to maintain their projects and create Operator releases targeting newer versions of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
The following related base images for Operator projects are not deprecated. The runtime functionality and configuration APIs for these base images are still supported for bug fixes and for addressing CVEs.
* The base image for Ansible-based Operator projects
* The base image for Helm-based Operator projects
For the most recent list of major functionality that has been deprecated or removed within Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, refer to the Deprecated and removed features section of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release notes.
For information about the unsupported, community-maintained, version of the Operator SDK, see Operator SDK (Operator Framework).
----
This process is accomplished using two centerpieces of the Operator Framework:
Operator SDK:: The operator-sdk CLI tool and controller-runtime library API
Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM):: Installation, upgrade, and role-based access control (RBAC) of Operators on a cluster

[NOTE]
----
This tutorial goes into greater detail than Getting started with Operator SDK for Go-based Operators.
----

# Prerequisites

* Operator SDK CLI installed
* OpenShift CLI (oc) 4.16+ installed
* Go 1.21+
* Logged into an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 cluster with oc with an account that has cluster-admin permissions
* To allow the cluster to pull the image, the repository where you push your image must be set as public, or you must configure an image pull secret

* Installing the Operator SDK CLI
* Getting started with the OpenShift CLI

# Creating a project

Use the Operator SDK CLI to create a project called {app}-operator.

1. Create a directory for the project:

```terminal
$ mkdir -p $HOME/projects/{app}-operator
```

2. Change to the directory:

```terminal
$ cd $HOME/projects/{app}-operator
```

3. Activate support for Go modules:

```terminal
$ export GO111MODULE=on
```

4. Run the operator-sdk init command
to initialize the project:

```terminal
$ operator-sdk init \
    --domain=example.com \
    --repo=github.com/example-inc/{app}-operator
```


[NOTE]
----
The operator-sdk init command uses the Go plugin by default.
----

The operator-sdk init command generates a go.mod file to be used with Go modules. The --repo flag is required when creating a project outside of $GOPATH/src/, because generated files require a valid module path.

## PROJECT file

Among the files generated by the operator-sdk init command is a Kubebuilder PROJECT file. Subsequent operator-sdk commands, as well as help output, that are run from the project root read this file and are aware that the project type is {type}. For example:


```yaml
domain: example.com
layout:
- go.kubebuilder.io/v3
projectName: memcached-operator
repo: github.com/example-inc/memcached-operator
version: "3"
plugins:
  manifests.sdk.operatorframework.io/v2: {}
  scorecard.sdk.operatorframework.io/v2: {}
  sdk.x-openshift.io/v1: {}
```


## About the Manager

The main program for the Operator is the main.go file, which initializes and runs the Manager. The Manager automatically registers the Scheme for all custom resource (CR) API definitions and sets up and runs controllers and webhooks.

The Manager can restrict the namespace that all controllers watch for resources:


```go
mgr, err := ctrl.NewManager(cfg, manager.Options{Namespace: namespace})
```


By default, the Manager watches the namespace where the Operator runs. To watch all namespaces, you can leave the namespace option empty:


```go
mgr, err := ctrl.NewManager(cfg, manager.Options{Namespace: ""})
```


You can also use the MultiNamespacedCacheBuilder function to watch a specific set of namespaces:


```go
var namespaces []string 1
mgr, err := ctrl.NewManager(cfg, manager.Options{ 2
   NewCache: cache.MultiNamespacedCacheBuilder(namespaces),
})
```


List of namespaces.
Creates a Cmd struct to provide shared dependencies and start components.

## About multi-group APIs

Before you create an API and controller, consider whether your Operator requires multiple API groups. This tutorial covers the default case of a single group API, but to change the layout of your project to support multi-group APIs, you can run the following command:


```terminal
$ operator-sdk edit --multigroup=true
```


This command updates the PROJECT file, which should look like the following example:


```yaml
domain: example.com
layout: go.kubebuilder.io/v3
multigroup: true
...
```


For multi-group projects, the API Go type files are created in the apis/<group>/<version>/ directory, and the controllers are created in the controllers/<group>/ directory. The Dockerfile is then updated accordingly.

* For more details on migrating to a multi-group project, see the Kubebuilder documentation.

# Creating an API and controller

Use the Operator SDK CLI to create a custom resource definition (CRD) API and controller.

1. Run the following command to create an API with group cache, version, v1, and kind Memcached:

```terminal
$ operator-sdk create api \
    --group=cache \
    --version=v1 \
    --kind=Memcached
```

2. When prompted, enter y for creating both the resource and controller:

```terminal
Create Resource [y/n]
y
Create Controller [y/n]
y
```

Example output

```terminal
Writing scaffold for you to edit...
api/v1/memcached_types.go
controllers/memcached_controller.go
...
```


This process generates the Memcached resource API at api/v1/memcached_types.go and the controller at controllers/memcached_controller.go.

## Defining the API

Define the API for the Memcached custom resource (CR).

1. Modify the Go type definitions at api/v1/memcached_types.go to have the following spec and status:

```go
// MemcachedSpec defines the desired state of Memcached
type MemcachedSpec struct {
	// +kubebuilder:validation:Minimum=0
	// Size is the size of the memcached deployment
	Size int32 `json:"size"`
}

// MemcachedStatus defines the observed state of Memcached
type MemcachedStatus struct {
	// Nodes are the names of the memcached pods
	Nodes []string `json:"nodes"`
}
```

2. Update the generated code for the resource type:

```terminal
$ make generate
```


[TIP]
----
After you modify a *_types.go file, you must run the make generate command to update the generated code for that resource type.
----

The above Makefile target invokes the controller-gen utility to update the api/v1/zz_generated.deepcopy.go file. This ensures your API Go type definitions implement the runtime.Object interface that all Kind types must implement.

## Generating CRD manifests

After the API is defined with spec and status fields and custom resource definition (CRD) validation markers, you can generate CRD manifests.

* Run the following command to generate and update CRD manifests:

```terminal
$ make manifests
```


This Makefile target invokes the controller-gen utility to generate the CRD manifests in the config/crd/bases/cache.example.com_memcacheds.yaml file.

### About OpenAPI validation

OpenAPIv3 schemas are added to CRD manifests in the spec.validation block when the manifests are generated. This validation block allows Kubernetes to validate the properties in a Memcached custom resource (CR) when it is created or updated.

Markers, or annotations, are available to configure validations for your API. These markers always have a +kubebuilder:validation prefix.

* For more details on the usage of markers in API code, see the following Kubebuilder documentation:
* CRD generation
* Markers
* List of OpenAPIv3 validation markers
* For more details about OpenAPIv3 validation schemas in CRDs, see the Kubernetes documentation.

# Implementing the controller

After creating a new API and controller, you can implement the controller logic.

* For this example, replace the generated controller file controllers/memcached_controller.go with following example implementation:
Example memcached_controller.go

// SetupWithManager sets up the controller with the Manager.
func (r *MemcachedReconciler) SetupWithManager(mgr ctrl.Manager) error {
        return ctrl.NewControllerManagedBy(mgr).
                For(&cachev1.Memcached{}).
                Owns(&appsv1.Deployment{}).
                Complete(r)
}
```

The example controller runs the following reconciliation logic for each Memcached custom resource (CR):
* Create a Memcached deployment if it does not exist.
* Ensure that the deployment size is the same as specified by the Memcached CR spec.
* Update the Memcached CR status with the names of the memcached pods.

The next subsections explain how the controller in the example implementation watches resources and how the reconcile loop is triggered. You can skip these subsections to go directly to Running the Operator.

## Resources watched by the controller

The SetupWithManager() function in controllers/memcached_controller.go specifies how the controller is built to watch a CR and other resources that are owned and managed by that controller.


```go
import (
	...
	appsv1 "k8s.io/api/apps/v1"
	...
)

func (r *MemcachedReconciler) SetupWithManager(mgr ctrl.Manager) error {
	return ctrl.NewControllerManagedBy(mgr).
		For(&cachev1.Memcached{}).
		Owns(&appsv1.Deployment{}).
		Complete(r)
}
```


NewControllerManagedBy() provides a controller builder that allows various controller configurations.

For(&cachev1.Memcached{}) specifies the Memcached type as the primary resource to watch. For each Add, Update, or Delete event for a Memcached type, the reconcile loop is sent a reconcile Request argument, which consists of a namespace and name key, for that Memcached object.

Owns(&appsv1.Deployment{}) specifies the Deployment type as the secondary resource to watch. For each Deployment type Add, Update, or Delete event, the event handler maps each event to a reconcile request for the owner of the deployment. In this case, the owner is the Memcached object for which the deployment was created.

## Controller configurations

You can initialize a controller by using many other useful configurations. For example:

* Set the maximum number of concurrent reconciles for the controller by using the MaxConcurrentReconciles option, which defaults to 1:

```go
func (r *MemcachedReconciler) SetupWithManager(mgr ctrl.Manager) error {
    return ctrl.NewControllerManagedBy(mgr).
        For(&cachev1.Memcached{}).
        Owns(&appsv1.Deployment{}).
        WithOptions(controller.Options{
            MaxConcurrentReconciles: 2,
        }).
        Complete(r)
}
```

* Filter watch events using predicates.
* Choose the type of EventHandler to change how a watch event translates to reconcile requests for the reconcile loop. For Operator relationships that are more complex than primary and secondary resources, you can use the EnqueueRequestsFromMapFunc handler to transform a watch event into an arbitrary set of reconcile requests.

For more details on these and other configurations, see the upstream Builder and Controller GoDocs.

## Reconcile loop

Every controller has a reconciler object with a Reconcile() method that implements the reconcile loop. The reconcile loop is passed the Request argument, which is a namespace and name key used to find the primary resource object, Memcached, from the cache:


```go
import (
	ctrl "sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime"

	cachev1 "github.com/example-inc/memcached-operator/api/v1"
	...
)

func (r *MemcachedReconciler) Reconcile(ctx context.Context, req ctrl.Request) (ctrl.Result, error) {
  // Lookup the Memcached instance for this reconcile request
  memcached := &cachev1.Memcached{}
  err := r.Get(ctx, req.NamespacedName, memcached)
  ...
}
```


Based on the return values, result, and error, the request might be requeued and the reconcile loop might be triggered again:


```go
// Reconcile successful - don't requeue
return ctrl.Result{}, nil
// Reconcile failed due to error - requeue
return ctrl.Result{}, err
// Requeue for any reason other than an error
return ctrl.Result{Requeue: true}, nil
```


You can set the Result.RequeueAfter to requeue the request after a grace period as well:


```go
import "time"

// Reconcile for any reason other than an error after 5 seconds
return ctrl.Result{RequeueAfter: time.Second*5}, nil
```



[NOTE]
----
You can return Result with RequeueAfter set to periodically reconcile a CR.
----

For more on reconcilers, clients, and interacting with resource events, see the Controller Runtime Client API documentation.

## Permissions and RBAC manifests

The controller requires certain RBAC permissions to interact with the resources it manages. These are specified using RBAC markers, such as the following:


```go
// +kubebuilder:rbac:groups=cache.example.com,resources=memcacheds,verbs=get;list;watch;create;update;patch;delete
// +kubebuilder:rbac:groups=cache.example.com,resources=memcacheds/status,verbs=get;update;patch
// +kubebuilder:rbac:groups=cache.example.com,resources=memcacheds/finalizers,verbs=update
// +kubebuilder:rbac:groups=apps,resources=deployments,verbs=get;list;watch;create;update;patch;delete
// +kubebuilder:rbac:groups=core,resources=pods,verbs=get;list;

func (r *MemcachedReconciler) Reconcile(ctx context.Context, req ctrl.Request) (ctrl.Result, error) {
  ...
}
```


The ClusterRole object manifest at config/rbac/role.yaml is generated from the previous markers by using the controller-gen utility whenever the make manifests command is run.

# Enabling proxy support

Operator authors can develop Operators that support network proxies.
Cluster administrators
configure proxy support for the environment variables that are handled by Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM). To support proxied clusters, your Operator must inspect the environment for the following standard proxy variables and pass the values to Operands:

* HTTP_PROXY
* HTTPS_PROXY
* NO_PROXY


[NOTE]
----
This tutorial uses HTTP_PROXY as an example environment variable.
----

* A cluster with cluster-wide egress proxy enabled.

1. Edit the controllers/memcached_controller.go file to include the following:
1. Import the proxy package from the operator-lib library:

```golang
import (
  ...
   "github.com/operator-framework/operator-lib/proxy"
)
```

2. Add the proxy.ReadProxyVarsFromEnv helper function to the reconcile loop and append the results to the Operand environments:

```golang
for i, container := range dep.Spec.Template.Spec.Containers {
		dep.Spec.Template.Spec.Containers[i].Env = append(container.Env, proxy.ReadProxyVarsFromEnv()...)
}
...
```

2. Set the environment variable on the Operator deployment by adding the following to the config/manager/manager.yaml file:

```yaml

# Running the Operator

There are three ways you can use the Operator SDK CLI to build and run your Operator:

* Run locally outside the cluster as a Go program.
* Run as a deployment on the cluster.
* Bundle your Operator and use Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to deploy on the cluster.


[NOTE]
----
Before running your Go-based Operator as either a deployment on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform or as a bundle that uses OLM, ensure that your project has been updated to use supported images.
----

## Running locally outside the cluster

You can run your Operator project as a Go program outside of the cluster. This is useful for development purposes to speed up deployment and testing.

* Run the following command to install the custom resource definitions (CRDs) in the cluster configured in your ~/.kube/config file and run the Operator locally:

```terminal
$ make install run
```

Example output

```terminal
...

```


## Running as a deployment on the cluster

You can run your Operator project as a deployment on your cluster.

* Prepared your Go-based Operator to run on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform by updating the project to use supported images

1. Run the following make commands to build and push the Operator image. Modify the IMG argument in the following steps to reference a repository that you have access to. You can obtain an account for storing containers at repository sites such as Quay.io.
1. Build the image:

```terminal
$ make docker-build IMG=<registry>/<user>/<image_name>:<tag>
```


[NOTE]
----
The Dockerfile generated by the SDK for the Operator explicitly references GOARCH=amd64 for go build. This can be amended to GOARCH=$TARGETARCH for non-AMD64 architectures. Docker will automatically set the environment variable to the value specified by –platform. With Buildah, the –build-arg will need to be used for the purpose. For more information, see Multiple Architectures.
----
2. Push the image to a repository:

```terminal
$ make docker-push IMG=<registry>/<user>/<image_name>:<tag>
```


[NOTE]
----
The name and tag of the image, for example IMG=<registry>/<user>/<image_name>:<tag>, in both the commands can also be set in your Makefile. Modify the IMG ?= controller:latest value to set your default image name.
----
2. Run the following command to deploy the Operator:

```terminal
$ make deploy IMG=<registry>/<user>/<image_name>:<tag>
```


By default, this command creates a namespace with the name of your Operator project in the form <project_name>-system and is used for the deployment. This command also installs the RBAC manifests from config/rbac.
3. Run the following command to verify that the Operator is running:

```terminal
$ oc get deployment -n <project_name>-system
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                                    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
<project_name>-controller-manager       1/1     1            1           8m
```


## Bundling an Operator and deploying with Operator Lifecycle Manager

### Bundling an Operator

The Operator bundle format is the default packaging method for Operator SDK and Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM). You can get your Operator ready for use on OLM by using the Operator SDK to build and push your Operator project as a bundle image.

* Operator SDK CLI installed on a development workstation
* OpenShift CLI (oc) v4.16+ installed
* Operator project initialized by using the Operator SDK
* If your Operator is Go-based, your project must be updated to use supported images for running on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

1. Run the following make commands in your Operator project directory to build and push your Operator image. Modify the IMG argument in the following steps to reference a repository that you have access to. You can obtain an account for storing containers at repository sites such as Quay.io.
1. Build the image:

```terminal
$ make docker-build IMG=<registry>/<user>/<operator_image_name>:<tag>
```


[NOTE]
----
The Dockerfile generated by the SDK for the Operator explicitly references GOARCH=amd64 for go build. This can be amended to GOARCH=$TARGETARCH for non-AMD64 architectures. Docker will automatically set the environment variable to the value specified by –platform. With Buildah, the –build-arg will need to be used for the purpose. For more information, see Multiple Architectures.
----
2. Push the image to a repository:

```terminal
$ make docker-push IMG=<registry>/<user>/<operator_image_name>:<tag>
```

2. Create your Operator bundle manifest by running the make bundle command, which invokes several commands, including the Operator SDK generate bundle and bundle validate subcommands:

```terminal
$ make bundle IMG=<registry>/<user>/<operator_image_name>:<tag>
```


Bundle manifests for an Operator describe how to display, create, and manage an application. The make bundle command creates the following files and directories in your Operator project:
* A bundle manifests directory named bundle/manifests that contains a ClusterServiceVersion object
* A bundle metadata directory named bundle/metadata
* All custom resource definitions (CRDs) in a config/crd directory
* A Dockerfile bundle.Dockerfile

These files are then automatically validated by using operator-sdk bundle validate to ensure the on-disk bundle representation is correct.
3. Build and push your bundle image by running the following commands. OLM consumes Operator bundles using an index image, which reference one or more bundle images.
1. Build the bundle image. Set BUNDLE_IMG with the details for the registry, user namespace, and image tag where you intend to push the image:

```terminal
$ make bundle-build BUNDLE_IMG=<registry>/<user>/<bundle_image_name>:<tag>
```

2. Push the bundle image:

```terminal
$ docker push <registry>/<user>/<bundle_image_name>:<tag>
```


### Deploying an Operator with Operator Lifecycle Manager

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) helps you to install, update, and manage the lifecycle of Operators and their associated services on a Kubernetes cluster. OLM is installed by default on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and runs as a Kubernetes extension so that you can use the web console and the OpenShift CLI (oc) for all Operator lifecycle management functions without any additional tools.

The Operator bundle format is the default packaging method for Operator SDK and OLM. You can use the Operator SDK to quickly run a bundle image on OLM to ensure that it runs properly.

* Operator SDK CLI installed on a development workstation
* Operator bundle image built and pushed to a registry
* OLM installed on a Kubernetes-based cluster (v1.16.0 or later if you use apiextensions.k8s.io/v1 CRDs, for example Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16)
* Logged in to the cluster with oc using an account with cluster-admin permissions
* If your Operator is Go-based, your project must be updated to use supported images for running on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

* Enter the following command to run the Operator on the cluster:

```terminal
$ operator-sdk run bundle \1
    -n <namespace> \2
    <registry>/<user>/<bundle_image_name>:<tag> 3
```

The run bundle command creates a valid file-based catalog and installs the Operator bundle on your cluster using OLM.
Optional: By default, the command installs the Operator in the currently active project in your ~/.kube/config file. You can add the -n flag to set a different namespace scope for the installation.
If you do not specify an image, the command uses quay.io/operator-framework/opm:latest as the default index image. If you specify an image, the command uses the bundle image itself as the index image.

[IMPORTANT]
----
As of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.11, the run bundle command supports the file-based catalog format for Operator catalogs by default. The deprecated SQLite database format for Operator catalogs continues to be supported; however, it will be removed in a future release. It is recommended that Operator authors migrate their workflows to the file-based catalog format.
----

This command performs the following actions:
* Create an index image referencing your bundle image. The index image is opaque and ephemeral, but accurately reflects how a bundle would be added to a catalog in production.
* Create a catalog source that points to your new index image, which enables OperatorHub to discover your Operator.
* Deploy your Operator to your cluster by creating an OperatorGroup, Subscription, InstallPlan, and all other required resources, including RBAC.

# Creating a custom resource

After your Operator is installed, you can test it by creating a custom resource (CR) that is now provided on the cluster by the Operator.

* Example {app-proper} Operator, which provides the {app-proper} CR, installed on a cluster

1. Change to the namespace where your Operator is installed. For example, if you deployed the Operator using the make deploy command:

```terminal
$ oc project {app}-operator-system
```

2. Edit the sample {app-proper} CR manifest at config/samples/{group}_v1_{app}.yaml to contain the following specification:

```yaml
apiVersion: {group}.example.com/v1
kind: {app-proper}
metadata:
  name: {app}-sample
...
spec:
...
  size: 3
```

3. Create the CR:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f config/samples/{group}_v1_{app}.yaml
```

4. Ensure that the {app-proper} Operator creates the deployment for the sample CR with the correct size:

```terminal
$ oc get deployments
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                                    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
memcached-operator-controller-manager   1/1     1            1           8m
memcached-sample                        3/3     3            3           1m
```

5. Check the pods and CR status to confirm the status is updated with the {app-proper} pod names.
1. Check the pods:

```terminal
$ oc get pods
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                                  READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
memcached-sample-6fd7c98d8-7dqdr      1/1       Running   0          1m
memcached-sample-6fd7c98d8-g5k7v      1/1       Running   0          1m
memcached-sample-6fd7c98d8-m7vn7      1/1       Running   0          1m
```

2. Check the CR status:

```terminal
$ oc get {app}/{app}-sample -o yaml
```

Example output

```yaml
apiVersion: {group}.example.com/v1
kind: {app-proper}
metadata:
...
  name: {app}-sample
...
spec:
  size: 3
status:
  nodes:
  - {app}-sample-6fd7c98d8-7dqdr
  - {app}-sample-6fd7c98d8-g5k7v
  - {app}-sample-6fd7c98d8-m7vn7
```

6. Update the deployment size.
1. Update config/samples/{group}_v1_{app}.yaml file to change the spec.size field in the {app-proper} CR from 3 to 5:

```terminal
$ oc patch {app} {app}-sample \
    -p '{"spec":{"size": 5}}' \
    --type=merge
```

2. Confirm that the Operator changes the deployment size:

```terminal
$ oc get deployments
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                                    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
memcached-operator-controller-manager   1/1     1            1           10m
memcached-sample                        5/5     5            5           3m
```

7. Delete the CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete -f config/samples/{group}_v1_{app}.yaml
```

8. Clean up the resources that have been created as part of this tutorial.
* If you used the make deploy command to test the Operator, run the following command:

```terminal
$ make undeploy
```

* If you used the operator-sdk run bundle command to test the Operator, run the following command:

```terminal
$ operator-sdk cleanup <project_name>
```


# Additional resources

* See Project layout for Go-based Operators to learn about the directory structures created by the Operator SDK.
* If a cluster-wide egress proxy is configured, cluster administrators can override the proxy settings or inject a custom CA certificate for specific Operators running on Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).
