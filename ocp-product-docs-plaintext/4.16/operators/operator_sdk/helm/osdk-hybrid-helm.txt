Operator SDK tutorial for Hybrid Helm Operators

The standard Helm-based Operator support in the Operator SDK has limited functionality compared to the Go-based and Ansible-based Operator support that has reached the Auto Pilot capability (level V) in the Operator maturity model.

The Hybrid Helm Operator enhances the existing Helm-based support's abilities through Go APIs. With this hybrid approach of Helm and Go, the Operator SDK enables Operator authors to use the following process:

Generate a default structure for, or scaffold, a Go API in the same project as Helm.

Configure the Helm reconciler in the main.go file of the project, through the libraries provided by the Hybrid Helm Operator.


The Hybrid Helm Operator is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
This tutorial walks through the following process using the Hybrid Helm Operator:

Create a Memcached deployment through a Helm chart if it does not exist

Ensure that the deployment size is the same as specified by Memcached custom resource (CR) spec

Create a MemcachedBackup deployment by using the Go API
Prerequisites
Operator SDK CLI installed

OpenShift CLI (oc) 4.16+ installed

Logged into an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 cluster with oc with an account that has cluster-admin permissions

To allow the cluster to pull the image, the repository where you push your image must be set as public, or you must configure an image pull secret


Installing the Operator SDK CLI

Getting started with the OpenShift CLI
Creating a project
Use the Operator SDK CLI to create a project called memcached-operator.

Create a directory for the project:

Change to the directory:

Run the operator-sdk init command to initialize the project. Use a domain of example.com so that all API groups are <group>.example.com:


This procedure creates a project structure that is compatible with both Helm and Go APIs. To learn more about the project directory structure, see Project layout.
Creating a Helm API
Use the Operator SDK CLI to create a Helm API.

Run the following command to create a Helm API with group cache, version v1, and kind Memcached:


This procedure also configures your Operator project to watch the Memcached resource with API version v1 and scaffolds a boilerplate Helm chart. Instead of creating the project from the boilerplate Helm chart scaffolded by the Operator SDK, you can alternatively use an existing chart from your local file system or remote chart repository.

For more details and examples for creating Helm API based on existing or new charts, run the following command:

$ operator-sdk create api --plugins helm.sdk.operatorframework.io/v1 --help
Existing Helm charts


Operator logic for the Helm API
By default, your scaffolded Operator project watches Memcached resource events as shown in the watches.yaml file and executes Helm releases using the specified chart.

# Use the 'create api' subcommand to add watches to this file.
- group: cache.my.domain
  version: v1
  kind: Memcached
  chart: helm-charts/memcached
#+kubebuilder:scaffold:watch
For detailed documentation on customizing the Helm Operator logic through the chart, see Understanding the Operator logic.
Custom Helm reconciler configurations using provided library APIs
A disadvantage of existing Helm-based Operators is the inability to configure the Helm reconciler, because it is abstracted from users. For a Helm-based Operator to reach the Seamless Upgrades capability (level II and later) that reuses an already existing Helm chart, a hybrid between the Go and Helm Operator types adds value.

The APIs provided in the helm-operator-plugins library allow Operator authors to make the following configurations:

Customize value mapping based on cluster state

Execute code in specific events by configuring the reconciler's event recorder

Customize the reconciler's logger

Setup Install, Upgrade, and Uninstall annotations to enable Helm's actions to be configured based on the annotations found in custom resources watched by the reconciler

Configure the reconciler to run with Pre and Post hooks


The above configurations to the reconciler can be done in the main.go file:

// Operator's main.go
// With the help of helpers provided in the library, the reconciler can be
// configured here before starting the controller with this reconciler.
reconciler := reconciler.New(
 reconciler.WithChart(*chart),
 reconciler.WithGroupVersionKind(gvk),
)

if err := reconciler.SetupWithManager(mgr); err != nil {
 panic(fmt.Sprintf("unable to create reconciler: %s", err))
}
Creating a Go API
Use the Operator SDK CLI to create a Go API.

Run the following command to create a Go API with group cache, version v1, and kind MemcachedBackup:

When prompted, enter y for creating both resource and controller:


This procedure generates the MemcachedBackup resource API at api/v1/memcachedbackup_types.go and the controller at controllers/memcachedbackup_controller.go.

Defining the API
Define the API for the MemcachedBackup custom resource (CR).

Represent this Go API by defining the MemcachedBackup type, which will have a MemcachedBackupSpec.Size field to set the quantity of Memcached backup instances (CRs) to be deployed, and a MemcachedBackupStatus.Nodes field to store a CR's pod names.

The Node field is used to illustrate an example of a Status field.
Define the API for the MemcachedBackup CR by modifying the Go type definitions in the api/v1/memcachedbackup_types.go file to have the following spec and status:

Update the generated code for the resource type:

After the API is defined with spec and status fields and CRD validation markers, generate and update the CRD manifests:


This Makefile target invokes the controller-gen utility to generate the CRD manifests in the config/crd/bases/cache.my.domain_memcachedbackups.yaml file.
Controller implementation
The controller in this tutorial performs the following actions:

Create a Memcached deployment if it does not exist.

Ensure that the deployment size is the same as specified by the Memcached CR spec.

Update the Memcached CR status with the names of the memcached pods.


For a detailed explanation on how to configure the controller to perform the above mentioned actions, see Implementing the controller in the Operator SDK tutorial for standard Go-based Operators.
Differences in main.go
For standard Go-based Operators and the Hybrid Helm Operator, the main.go file handles the scaffolding the initialization and running of the Manager program for the Go API. For the Hybrid Helm Operator, however, the main.go file also exposes the logic for loading the watches.yaml file and configuring the Helm reconciler.

...
	for _, w := range ws {
		// Register controller with the factory
		reconcilePeriod := defaultReconcilePeriod
		if w.ReconcilePeriod != nil {
			reconcilePeriod = w.ReconcilePeriod.Duration
		}

		maxConcurrentReconciles := defaultMaxConcurrentReconciles
		if w.MaxConcurrentReconciles != nil {
			maxConcurrentReconciles = *w.MaxConcurrentReconciles
		}

		r, err := reconciler.New(
			reconciler.WithChart(*w.Chart),
			reconciler.WithGroupVersionKind(w.GroupVersionKind),
			reconciler.WithOverrideValues(w.OverrideValues),
			reconciler.SkipDependentWatches(w.WatchDependentResources != nil && !*w.WatchDependentResources),
			reconciler.WithMaxConcurrentReconciles(maxConcurrentReconciles),
			reconciler.WithReconcilePeriod(reconcilePeriod),
			reconciler.WithInstallAnnotations(annotation.DefaultInstallAnnotations...),
			reconciler.WithUpgradeAnnotations(annotation.DefaultUpgradeAnnotations...),
			reconciler.WithUninstallAnnotations(annotation.DefaultUninstallAnnotations...),
		)
...
The manager is initialized with both Helm and Go reconcilers:

...
// Setup manager with Go API
   if err = (&controllers.MemcachedBackupReconciler{
		Client: mgr.GetClient(),
		Scheme: mgr.GetScheme(),
	}).SetupWithManager(mgr); err != nil {
		setupLog.Error(err, "unable to create controller", "controller", "MemcachedBackup")
		os.Exit(1)
	}

   ...
// Setup manager with Helm API
	for _, w := range ws {

      ...
		if err := r.SetupWithManager(mgr); err != nil {
			setupLog.Error(err, "unable to create controller", "controller", "Helm")
			os.Exit(1)
		}
		setupLog.Info("configured watch", "gvk", w.GroupVersionKind, "chartPath", w.ChartPath, "maxConcurrentReconciles", maxConcurrentReconciles, "reconcilePeriod", reconcilePeriod)
	}

// Start the manager
   if err := mgr.Start(ctrl.SetupSignalHandler()); err != nil {
		setupLog.Error(err, "problem running manager")
		os.Exit(1)
	}
Permissions and RBAC manifests
The controller requires certain role-based access control (RBAC) permissions to interact with the resources it manages. For the Go API, these are specified with RBAC markers, as shown in the Operator SDK tutorial for standard Go-based Operators.

For the Helm API, the permissions are scaffolded by default in roles.yaml. Currently, however, due to a known issue when the Go API is scaffolded, the permissions for the Helm API are overwritten. As a result of this issue, ensure that the permissions defined in roles.yaml match your requirements.

This known issue is being tracked in https://github.com/operator-framework/helm-operator-plugins/issues/142.
The following is an example role.yaml for a Memcached Operator:

RBAC markers for Go-based Operators
Running locally outside the cluster
You can run your Operator project as a Go program outside of the cluster. This is useful for development purposes to speed up deployment and testing.

Run the following command to install the custom resource definitions (CRDs) in the cluster configured in your ~/.kube/config file and run the Operator locally:
Running as a deployment on the cluster
You can run your Operator project as a deployment on your cluster.

Run the following make commands to build and push the Operator image. Modify the IMG argument in the following steps to reference a repository that you have access to. You can obtain an account for storing containers at repository sites such as Quay.io.

Run the following command to deploy the Operator:

Run the following command to verify that the Operator is running:
Creating custom resources
After your Operator is installed, you can test it by creating custom resources (CRs) that are now provided on the cluster by the Operator.

Change to the namespace where your Operator is installed:

Update the sample Memcached CR manifest at the config/samples/cache_v1_memcached.yaml file by updating the replicaCount field to 3:

Create the Memcached CR:

Ensure that the Memcached Operator creates the deployment for the sample CR with the correct size:

Update the sample MemcachedBackup CR manifest at the config/samples/cache_v1_memcachedbackup.yaml file by updating the size to 2:

Create the MemcachedBackup CR:

Ensure that the count of memcachedbackup pods is the same as specified in the CR:

You can update the spec in each of the above CRs, and then apply them again. The controller reconciles again and ensures that the size of the pods is as specified in the spec of the respective CRs.
