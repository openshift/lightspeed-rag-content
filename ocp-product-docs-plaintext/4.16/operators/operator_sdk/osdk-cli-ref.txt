# Operator SDK CLI reference


The Operator SDK command-line interface (CLI) is a development kit designed to make writing Operators easier.

[IMPORTANT]
----
The Red Hat-supported version of the Operator SDK CLI tool, including the related scaffolding and testing tools for Operator projects, is deprecated and is planned to be removed in a future release of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. Red Hat will provide bug fixes and support for this feature during the current release lifecycle, but this feature will no longer receive enhancements and will be removed from future Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform releases.
The Red Hat-supported version of the Operator SDK is not recommended for creating new Operator projects. Operator authors with existing Operator projects can use the version of the Operator SDK CLI tool released with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 to maintain their projects and create Operator releases targeting newer versions of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
The following related base images for Operator projects are not deprecated. The runtime functionality and configuration APIs for these base images are still supported for bug fixes and for addressing CVEs.
* The base image for Ansible-based Operator projects
* The base image for Helm-based Operator projects
For the most recent list of major functionality that has been deprecated or removed within Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, refer to the Deprecated and removed features section of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release notes.
For information about the unsupported, community-maintained, version of the Operator SDK, see Operator SDK (Operator Framework).
----

```terminal
$ operator-sdk <command> [<subcommand>] [<argument>] [<flags>]
```

Operator authors with cluster administrator access to a Kubernetes-based cluster (such as Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform) can use the Operator SDK CLI to develop their own Operators based on Go, Ansible, or Helm. Kubebuilder is embedded into the Operator SDK as the scaffolding solution for Go-based Operators, which means existing Kubebuilder projects can be used as is with the Operator SDK and continue to work.

# bundle

The operator-sdk bundle command manages Operator bundle metadata.

## validate

The bundle validate subcommand validates an Operator bundle.



# cleanup

The operator-sdk cleanup command destroys and removes resources that were created for an Operator that was deployed with the run command.



# completion

The operator-sdk completion command generates shell completions to make issuing CLI commands quicker and easier.





For example:


```terminal
$ operator-sdk completion bash
```



```terminal
# bash completion for operator-sdk                         -*- shell-script -*-
...
# ex: ts=4 sw=4 et filetype=sh
```


# create

The operator-sdk create command is used to create, or scaffold, a Kubernetes API.

## api

The create api subcommand scaffolds a Kubernetes API. The subcommand must be run in a project that was initialized with the init command.



# generate

The operator-sdk generate command invokes a specific generator to generate code or manifests.

## bundle

The generate bundle subcommand generates a set of bundle manifests, metadata, and a bundle.Dockerfile file for your Operator project.


[NOTE]
----
Typically, you run the generate kustomize manifests subcommand first to generate the input Kustomize bases that are used by the generate bundle subcommand. However, you can use the make bundle command in an initialized project to automate running these commands in sequence.
----



* See Bundling an Operator for a full procedure that includes using the make bundle command to call the generate bundle subcommand.

## kustomize

The generate kustomize subcommand contains subcommands that generate Kustomize data for the Operator.

### manifests

The generate kustomize manifests subcommand generates or regenerates Kustomize bases and a kustomization.yaml file in the config/manifests directory, which are used to build bundle manifests by other Operator SDK commands. This command interactively asks for UI metadata, an important component of manifest bases, by default unless a base already exists or you set the --interactive=false flag.



# init

The operator-sdk init command initializes an Operator project and generates, or scaffolds, a default project directory layout for the given plugin.

This command writes the following files:

* Boilerplate license file
* PROJECT file with the domain and repository
* Makefile to build the project
* go.mod file with project dependencies
* kustomization.yaml file for customizing manifests
* Patch file for customizing images for manager manifests
* Patch file for enabling Prometheus metrics
* main.go file to run



# run

The operator-sdk run command provides options that can launch the Operator in various environments.

## bundle

The run bundle subcommand deploys an Operator in the bundle format with Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).



1. The restricted security context is not compatible with the default namespace. To configure your Operator's pod security admission in your production environment, see "Complying with pod security admission". For more information about pod security admission, see "Understanding and managing pod security admission".

* See Operator group membership for details on possible install modes.

## bundle-upgrade

The run bundle-upgrade subcommand upgrades an Operator that was previously installed in the bundle format with Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

To configure your Operator's pod security admission in your production environment, see "Complying with pod security admission". For more information about pod security admission, see "Understanding and managing pod security admission".

# scorecard

The operator-sdk scorecard command runs the scorecard tool to validate an Operator bundle and provide suggestions for improvements. The command takes one argument, either a bundle image or directory containing manifests and metadata. If the argument holds an image tag, the image must be present remotely.
