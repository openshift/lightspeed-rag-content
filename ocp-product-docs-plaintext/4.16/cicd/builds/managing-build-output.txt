Managing build output

Use the following sections for an overview of and instructions for managing build output.
Build output
Builds that use the source-to-image (S2I) strategy result in the creation of a new container image. The image is then pushed to the container image registry specified in the output section of the Build specification.

If the output kind is ImageStreamTag, then the image will be pushed to the integrated OpenShift image registry and tagged in the specified imagestream. If the output is of type DockerImage, then the name of the output reference will be used as a docker push specification. The specification may contain a registry or will default to DockerHub if no registry is specified. If the output section of the build specification is empty, then the image will not be pushed at the end of the build.

spec:
  output:
    to:
      kind: "ImageStreamTag"
      name: "sample-image:latest"
spec:
  output:
    to:
      kind: "DockerImage"
      name: "my-registry.mycompany.com:5000/myimages/myimage:tag"
Output image environment variables
source-to-image (S2I) strategy builds set the following environment variables on output images:


Additionally, any user-defined environment variable, for example those configured with S2I strategy options, will also be part of the output image environment variable list.
Output image labels
source-to-image (S2I) builds set the following labels on output images:


You can also use the BuildConfig.spec.output.imageLabels field to specify a list of custom labels that will be applied to each image built from the build configuration.

spec:
  output:
    to:
      kind: "ImageStreamTag"
      name: "my-image:latest"
    imageLabels:
    - name: "vendor"
      value: "MyCompany"
    - name: "authoritative-source-url"
      value: "registry.mycompany.com"
