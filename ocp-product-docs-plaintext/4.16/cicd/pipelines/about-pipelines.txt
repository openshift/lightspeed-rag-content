# About Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines



Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines is a cloud-native, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) solution based on Kubernetes resources. It uses Tekton building blocks to automate deployments across multiple platforms by abstracting away the underlying implementation details. Tekton introduces a number of standard custom resource definitions (CRDs) for defining CI/CD pipelines that are portable across Kubernetes distributions.


[NOTE]
----
Because Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines releases on a different cadence from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, the Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines documentation is now available as separate documentation sets for each minor version of the product.
The Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines documentation is available at https://docs.openshift.com/pipelines/.
Documentation for specific versions is available using the version selector drop-down list, or directly by adding the version to the URL, for example, https://docs.openshift.com/pipelines/1.11.
In addition, the Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines documentation is also available on the Red Hat Customer Portal at https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_pipelines/.
For additional information about the Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines life cycle and supported platforms, refer to the Platform Life Cycle Policy.
