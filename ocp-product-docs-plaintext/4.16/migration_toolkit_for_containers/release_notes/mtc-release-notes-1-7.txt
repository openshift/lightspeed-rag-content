# Migration Toolkit for Containers 1.7 release notes


The release notes for Migration Toolkit for Containers (MTC) describe new features and enhancements, deprecated features, and known issues.
The MTC enables you to migrate application workloads between Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters at the granularity of a namespace.
You can migrate from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3 to 4.16 and between Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 clusters.
MTC provides a web console and an API, based on Kubernetes custom resources, to help you control the migration and minimize application downtime.
For information on the support policy for MTC, see OpenShift Application and Cluster Migration Solutions, part of the Red Hat Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy.

# Migration Toolkit for Containers 1.7.19 release notes

Migration Toolkit for Containers (MTC) 1.7.19 is a Container Grade Only (CGO) release, which is released to refresh the health grades of the containers. No code was changed in the product itself compared to that of MTC 1.7.18.

## Resolved issues

This release has the following resolved issues:

A bug was introduced when building the MTC Operator for the 1.7.19 release. During QE testing, this bug meant that when attempting to install MTC 1.7.19 from the OperatorHub, the migration-operator pod failed during startup. The logs indicated that the Ansible Runner was crashing with an unhandled KeyError: 'http+unix' issue. The MTC Operator was in an incomplete state, and the required controller pods were never deployed, which rendered the Operator non-functional. This issue was caused by the python3-requests package.

The workaround was to downgrade to the last known working version of the python3-requests package, used in MTC 1.7.19, to python3-requests-2.20.0-3.el8_8.noarch. However, this action does mean exposure to the following vulnerability, RHSA-2023:4520.

## Known issues

Currently, if the backup storage location is not specified, application migration fails. (MIG-1649)

Workaround: Roll back and then restart the migration.

# Migration Toolkit for Containers 1.7.18 release notes

Migration Toolkit for Containers (MTC) 1.7.18 is a Container Grade Only (CGO) release, which is released to refresh the health grades of the containers. No code was changed in the product itself compared to that of MTC 1.7.17.

## Technical changes

Migration Toolkit for Containers (MTC) 1.7.18 has the following technical changes:

FIPS is a set of computer security standards developed by the United States federal government in accordance with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA).

Starting with version 1.7.18, MTC is designed for FIPS compliance.

# Migration Toolkit for Containers 1.7.17 release notes

Migration Toolkit for Containers (MTC) 1.7.17 is a Container Grade Only (CGO) release, which is released to refresh the health grades of the containers. No code was changed in the product itself compared to that of MTC 1.7.16.

# Migration Toolkit for Containers 1.7.16 release notes

## Resolved issues

This release has the following resolved issues:

A flaw was found in the net/http Golang standard library package, which impacts earlier versions of MTC. When parsing a multipart form, either explicitly with Request.ParseMultipartForm or implicitly with Request.FormValue, Request.PostFormValue, or Request.FormFile methods, limits on the total size of the parsed form are not applied to the memory consumed while reading a single form line. This permits a maliciously crafted input containing long lines to cause the allocation of arbitrarily large amounts of memory, potentially leading to memory exhaustion.

To resolve this issue, upgrade to MTC 1.7.16.

For more details, see CVE-2023-45290

A flaw was found in the crypto/x509 Golang standard library package, which impacts earlier versions of MTC. Verifying a certificate chain that contains a certificate with an unknown public key algorithm causes Certificate.Verify to panic. This affects all crypto/tls clients and servers that set Config.ClientAuth to VerifyClientCertIfGiven or RequireAndVerifyClientCert. The default behavior is for TLS servers to not verify client certificates.

To resolve this issue, upgrade to MTC 1.7.16.

For more details, see CVE-2024-24783.

A flaw was found in the net/mail Golang standard library package, which impacts earlier versions of MTC. The ParseAddressList function incorrectly handles comments, text in parentheses, and display names. As this is a misalignment with conforming address parsers, it can result in different trust decisions being made by programs using different parsers.

To resolve this issue, upgrade to MTC 1.7.16.

For more details, see CVE-2024-24784.

A flaw was found in the html/template Golang standard library package, which impacts earlier versions of MTC. If errors returned from MarshalJSON methods contain user-controlled data, they could be used to break the contextual auto-escaping behavior of the html/template package, allowing subsequent actions to inject unexpected content into templates.

To resolve this issue, upgrade to MTC 1.7.16.

For more details, see CVE-2024-24785.

A flaw was found in the webpack-dev-middleware package, which impacts earlier versions of MTC. This flaw fails to validate the supplied URL address sufficiently before returning local files, which could allow an attacker to craft URLs to return arbitrary local files from the developer&#8217;s machine.

To resolve this issue, upgrade to MTC 1.7.16.

For more details, see CVE-2024-29180.

A flaw was found in how the envoy proxy implements the HTTP/2 codec, which impacts earlier versions of MTC. There are insufficient limitations placed on the number of CONTINUATION frames that can be sent within a single stream, even after exceeding the header map limits of envoy. This flaw could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to send packets to vulnerable servers. These packets could consume compute resources and cause a denial of service (DoS).

To resolve this issue, upgrade to MTC 1.7.16.

For more details, see CVE-2024-30255.

## Known issues

This release has the following known issues:

On migrating any application with a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC), the Stage migration operation succeeds with warnings, but the Direct Volume Migration (DVM) fails with the rsync pod on the source namespace moving into an error state. (BZ#2256141)

When creating a new state migration plan that returns a conflict error message, the error message is cleared very shortly after it is displayed. (BZ#2144299)

When there are multiple Volume Snapshot Locations (VSLs) in a cluster with different provider types, but you have not set any of them as the default VSL, Velero results in a validation error that causes migration operations to fail. (BZ#2180565)

# Migration Toolkit for Containers 1.7.15 release notes

## Resolved issues

This release has the following resolved issues:

A flaw was found in the protojson.Unmarshal function that could cause the function to enter an infinite loop when unmarshaling certain forms of invalid JSON messages. This condition could occur when unmarshaling into a message that contained a google.protobuf.Any value or when the UnmarshalOptions.DiscardUnknown option was set in a JSON-formatted message.

To resolve this issue, upgrade to MTC 1.7.15.

For more details, see (CVE-2024-24786).

A vulnerability was found in Jose due to improper handling of highly compressed data. An attacker could send a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) encrypted message that contained compressed data that used large amounts of memory and CPU when decompressed by the Decrypt or DecryptMulti functions. 

To resolve this issue, upgrade to MTC 1.7.15.

For more details, see (CVE-2024-28180).

## Known issues

This release has the following known issues:

On migrating any application with Persistent Volume Claim (PVC), the Stage migration operation succeeds with warnings, and Direct Volume Migration (DVM) fails with the rsync pod on the source namespace going into an error state. (BZ#2256141)

When creating a new state migration plan that results in a conflict error message, the error message is cleared shortly after it is displayed. (BZ#2144299)

When there are multiple VSLs in a cluster with different provider types, and you set none of them as the default VSL, Velero results in a validation error that causes migration operations to fail. (BZ#2180565)

# Migration Toolkit for Containers 1.7.14 release notes

## Resolved issues

This release has the following resolved issues:

A flaw was found in the handling of multiplexed streams in the HTTP/2 protocol, which is utilized by Migration Toolkit for Containers (MTC). A client could repeatedly make a request for a new multiplex stream then immediately send an RST_STREAM frame to cancel those requests. This activity created additional workloads for the server in terms of setting up and dismantling streams, but avoided any server-side limitations on the maximum number of active streams per connection. As a result, a denial of service occurred due to server resource consumption.

* (CVE-2023-39318): A flaw was discovered in Golang, utilized by MTC. The html/template package did not properly handle HTML-like "" comment tokens, or the hashbang "#!" comment tokens, in <script> contexts. This flaw could cause the template parser to improperly interpret the contents of <script> contexts, causing actions to be improperly escaped.
* (BZ#2238062)  
* (BZ#2238088)
* (CVE-2023-39319): A flaw was discovered in Golang, utilized by MTC. The html/template package did not apply the proper rules for handling occurrences of "<script", "<!--", and "</script" within JavaScript literals in <script> contexts. This could cause the template parser to improperly consider script contexts to be terminated early, causing actions to be improperly escaped. 
* (BZ#2238062)  
* (BZ#2238088)
* (CVE-2023-39321): A flaw was discovered in Golang, utilized by MTC. Processing an incomplete post-handshake message for a QUIC connection could cause a panic.
* (BZ#2238062)  
* (BZ#2238088)
* (CVE-2023-3932): A flaw was discovered in Golang, utilized by MTC. Connections using the QUIC transport protocol did not set an upper bound on the amount of data buffered when reading post-handshake messages, allowing a malicious QUIC connection to cause unbounded memory growth. 
* (BZ#2238088)

To resolve these issues, upgrade to MTC 1.7.14.

In previous releases, after a migration was performed, the velero pod log was not included in the logs provided in the dropdown list. (BZ#2076593)

In previous releases, when trying to set any valid or invalid rsync options in the migrationcontroller, the log-reader was not showing any logs regarding the invalid options or about the rsync command being used. (BZ#2079252)

In previous releases, the default CPU requests on Velero/Restic were too demanding and fail in certain environments. Default CPU requests for Velero and Restic Pods are set to 500m. These values were high. (BZ#2088022)

## Known issues

This release has the following known issues:

After updating the replication repository to a different type and clicking Update Repository, it shows connection successful, but the UI is not updated with the correct details. When clicking on the Edit button again, it still shows the old replication repository information.

Furthermore, when trying to update the replication repository again, it still shows the old replication details. When selecting the new repository, it also shows all the information you entered previously and the Update repository is not enabled, as if there are no changes to be submitted. (BZ#2102020)

Migration fails at the restore stage because of initial backup has not been found. (BZ#2104874)

When updating the remote cluster, selecting the Azure resource group checkbox, and adding a resource group does not enable the Update cluster option. (BZ#2098594)

When creating a backupStorage credential secret in OpenShift Container Platform, if the migstorage is removed from the UI, a 404 error is returned and the underlying secret is not removed. (BZ#2100828)

After creating a migplan from backend, the Miganalytic resource displays the resource count as 0 in UI. (BZ#2102139)

After adding two trailing slashes, meaning //, to the exposed registry route, the MigCluster resource is showing the status as connected. When creating a migplan from backend with DIM, the plans move to the unready status. (BZ#2104864)

When editing the source cluster that has been added and is in Connected state, in the UI, the service account token is not visible in the field. To save the wizard, you have to fetch the token again and provide details inside the field. (BZ#2097668)

# Migration Toolkit for Containers 1.7.1 release notes

## Resolved issues

There are no major resolved issues in this release.

## Known issues

This release has the following known issues:

MigPlan cannot be validated because the destination namespace starts with a non-alphabetic character. (BZ#2102231)

The Cloud propagation phase in the migration controller is not functioning due to missing labels on Velero pods. The EnsureCloudSecretPropagated phase in the migration controller waits until replication repository secrets are propagated on both sides. As this label is missing on Velero pods, the phase is not functioning as expected. (BZ#2088026)

Default CPU requests on Velero/Restic are too demanding when making scheduling fail in certain environments. Default CPU requests for Velero and Restic Pods are set to 500m. These values are high. The resources can be configured in DPA using the podConfig field for Velero and Restic. Migration operator should set CPU requests to a lower value, such as 100m, so that Velero and Restic pods can be scheduled in resource constrained environments Migration Toolkit for Containers (MTC) often operates in. (BZ#2088022)

A warning is displayed on the persistentVolumes page after editing the storage class conversion plan. When editing the existing migration plan, a warning is displayed on the UI At least one PVC must be selected for Storage Class Conversion. (BZ#2079549)

When downloading a compressed (.zip) folder for all logs, the velero pod is missing. (BZ#2076599)

After a migration is performed, the velero pod log is not included in the logs provided in the dropdown list. (BZ#2076593)

# Migration Toolkit for Containers 1.7.0 release notes

## New features and enhancements

This release has the following new features and enhancements:

* The Migration Toolkit for Containers (MTC) Operator now depends upon the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Operator. When you install the MTC Operator, the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically installs the OADP Operator in the same namespace.
* You can migrate from a source cluster that is behind a firewall to a cloud-based destination cluster by establishing a network tunnel between the two clusters by using the crane tunnel-api command.
* Converting storage classes in the MTC web console: You can convert the storage class of a persistent volume (PV) by migrating it within the same cluster.

## Known issues

This release has the following known issues:

* MigPlan custom resource does not display a warning when an AWS gp2 PVC has no available space. (BZ#1963927)
* Direct and indirect data transfers do not work if the destination storage is a PV that is dynamically provisioned by the AWS Elastic File System (EFS). This is due to limitations of the AWS EFS Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver. (BZ#2085097)
* Block storage for IBM Cloud must be in the same availability zone. See the IBM FAQ for block storage for virtual private cloud.
* MTC 1.7.6 cannot migrate cron jobs from source clusters that support v1beta1 cron jobs to clusters of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 and later, which do not support v1beta1 cron jobs. (BZ#2149119)
