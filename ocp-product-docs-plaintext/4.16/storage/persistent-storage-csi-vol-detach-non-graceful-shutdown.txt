# Detach volumes after non-graceful node shutdown


This feature allows drivers to automatically detach volumes when a node goes down non-gracefully.

# Overview

A graceful node shutdown occurs when the kubelet&#8217;s node shutdown manager detects the upcoming node shutdown action. Non-graceful shutdowns occur when the kubelet does not detect a node shutdown action, which can occur because of system or hardware failures. Also, the kubelet may not detect a node shutdown action when the shutdown command does not trigger the Inhibitor Locks mechanism used by the kubelet on Linux, or because of a user error, for example, if the shutdownGracePeriod and shutdownGracePeriodCriticalPods details are not configured correctly for that node.

With this feature, when a non-graceful node shutdown occurs, you can manually add an out-of-service taint on the node to allow volumes to automatically detach from the node.

# Adding an out-of-service taint manually for automatic volume detachment

* Access to the cluster with cluster-admin privileges.

To allow volumes to detach automatically from a node after a non-graceful node shutdown:

1. After a node is detected as unhealthy, shut down the worker node.
2. Ensure that the node is shutdown by running the following command and checking the status:

```terminal
$ oc get node <node_name> 1
```

<node_name> = name of the node that shut down non-gracefully

[IMPORTANT]
----
If the node is not completely shut down, do not proceed with tainting the node. If the node is still up and the taint is applied, filesystem corruption can occur.
----
3. Taint the corresponding node object by running the following command:

[IMPORTANT]
----
Tainting a node this way deletes all pods on that node. This also causes any pods that are backed by
statefulsets to be evicted, and replacement pods to be created on a different node.
----

```terminal
$ oc adm taint node <node_name> node.kubernetes.io/out-of-service=nodeshutdown:NoExecute 1
```

<node_name> = name of the node that shut down non-gracefully

After the taint is applied, the volumes detach from the shutdown node allowing their disks to be attached to a different node.
Example

The resulting YAML file resembles the following:

```yaml
spec:
  taints:
  - effect: NoExecute
    key: node.kubernetes.io/out-of-service
    value: nodeshutdown
```

4. Restart the node.
5. Remove the taint from the corresponding node object by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc adm taint node <node_name> node.kubernetes.io/out-of-service=nodeshutdown:NoExecute- 1
```

<node_name> = name of the node that shut down non-gracefully
