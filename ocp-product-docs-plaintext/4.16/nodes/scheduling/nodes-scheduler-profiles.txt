# Scheduling pods using a scheduler profile


You can configure Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform to use a scheduling profile to schedule pods onto nodes within the cluster.

# About scheduler profiles

You can specify a scheduler profile to control how pods are scheduled onto nodes.

The following scheduler profiles are available:

LowNodeUtilization:: This profile attempts to spread pods evenly across nodes to get low resource usage per node. This profile provides the default scheduler behavior.
HighNodeUtilization:: This profile attempts to place as many pods as possible on to as few nodes as possible. This minimizes node count and has high resource usage per node.


[NOTE]
----
Switching to the HighNodeUtilization scheduler profile will result in all pods of a ReplicaSet object being scheduled on the same node. This will add an increased risk for pod failure if the node fails.
----

NoScoring:: This is a low-latency profile that strives for the quickest scheduling cycle by disabling all score plugins. This might sacrifice better scheduling decisions for faster ones.

# Configuring a scheduler profile

You can configure the scheduler to use a scheduler profile.

* Access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

1. Edit the Scheduler object:

```terminal
$ oc edit scheduler cluster
```

2. Specify the profile to use in the spec.profile field:

```yaml
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Scheduler
metadata:
  name: cluster
#...
spec:
  mastersSchedulable: false
  profile: HighNodeUtilization 1
#...
```

Set to LowNodeUtilization, HighNodeUtilization, or NoScoring.
3. Save the file to apply the changes.
