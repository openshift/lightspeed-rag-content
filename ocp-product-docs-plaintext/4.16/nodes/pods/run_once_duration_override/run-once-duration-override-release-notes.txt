# Run Once Duration Override Operator release notes


Cluster administrators can use the Run Once Duration Override Operator to force a limit on the time that run-once pods can be active. After the time limit expires, the cluster tries to terminate the run-once pods. The main reason to have such a limit is to prevent tasks such as builds to run for an excessive amount of time.
To apply the run-once duration override from the Run Once Duration Override Operator to run-once pods, you must enable it on each applicable namespace.
These release notes track the development of the Run Once Duration Override Operator for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
