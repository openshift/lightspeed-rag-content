# Configuring CPU and memory limits for logging components


You can configure both the CPU and memory limits for each of the logging components as needed.

# Configuring CPU and memory limits

The logging components allow for adjustments to both the CPU and memory limits.

1. Edit the ClusterLogging custom resource (CR) in the openshift-logging project:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-logging edit ClusterLogging instance
```


```yaml
apiVersion: "logging.openshift.io/v1"
kind: "ClusterLogging"
metadata:
  name: "instance"
  namespace: openshift-logging

...

spec:
  managementState: "Managed"
  logStore:
    type: "elasticsearch"
    elasticsearch:
      nodeCount: 3
      resources: 1
        limits:
          memory: 16Gi
        requests:
          cpu: 200m
          memory: 16Gi
      storage:
        storageClassName: "gp2"
        size: "200G"
      redundancyPolicy: "SingleRedundancy"
  visualization:
    type: "kibana"
    kibana:
      resources: 2
        limits:
          memory: 1Gi
        requests:
          cpu: 500m
          memory: 1Gi
      proxy:
        resources: 2
          limits:
            memory: 100Mi
          requests:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 100Mi
      replicas: 2
collection:
    resources: 3
      limits:
        memory: 736Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 200m
        memory: 736Mi
    type: fluentd
```

Specify the CPU and memory limits and requests for the log store as needed. For Elasticsearch, you must adjust both the request value and the limit value.
Specify the CPU and memory limits and requests for the log visualizer as needed.
Specify the CPU and memory limits and requests for the log collector as needed.
