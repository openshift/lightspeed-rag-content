# Visualization for logging



Visualization for logging is provided by deploying the Logging UI Plugin of the Cluster Observability Operator, which requires Operator installation.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Until the approaching General Availability (GA) release of the Cluster Observability Operator (COO), which is currently in Technology Preview (TP), Red Hat provides support to customers who are using Logging 6.0 or later with the COO for its Logging UI Plugin on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14 or later. This support exception is temporary as the COO includes several independent features, some of which are still TP features, but the Logging UI Plugin is ready for GA.
