Example condition messages
The following are examples of some condition messages from the Status section of the Elasticsearch instance.

The following status message indicates that a node has exceeded the configured low watermark, and no shard will be allocated to this node.

status:
  nodes:
  - conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: 2019-03-15T15:57:22Z
      message: Disk storage usage for node is 27.5gb (36.74%). Shards will be not
        be allocated on this node.
      reason: Disk Watermark Low
      status: "True"
      type: NodeStorage
    deploymentName: example-elasticsearch-cdm-0-1
    upgradeStatus: {}
The following status message indicates that a node has exceeded the configured high watermark, and shards will be relocated to other nodes.

status:
  nodes:
  - conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: 2019-03-15T16:04:45Z
      message: Disk storage usage for node is 27.5gb (36.74%). Shards will be relocated
        from this node.
      reason: Disk Watermark High
      status: "True"
      type: NodeStorage
    deploymentName: example-elasticsearch-cdm-0-1
    upgradeStatus: {}
The following status message indicates that the Elasticsearch log store node selector in the custom resource (CR) does not match any nodes in the cluster:

status:
    nodes:
    - conditions:
      - lastTransitionTime: 2019-04-10T02:26:24Z
        message: '0/8 nodes are available: 8 node(s) didn''t match node selector.'
        reason: Unschedulable
        status: "True"
        type: Unschedulable
The following status message indicates that the Elasticsearch log store CR uses a non-existent persistent volume claim (PVC).

status:
   nodes:
   - conditions:
     - last Transition Time:  2019-04-10T05:55:51Z
       message:               pod has unbound immediate PersistentVolumeClaims (repeated 5 times)
       reason:                Unschedulable
       status:                True
       type:                  Unschedulable
The following status message indicates that your Elasticsearch log store cluster does not have enough nodes to support the redundancy policy.

status:
  clusterHealth: ""
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: 2019-04-17T20:01:31Z
    message: Wrong RedundancyPolicy selected. Choose different RedundancyPolicy or
      add more nodes with data roles
    reason: Invalid Settings
    status: "True"
    type: InvalidRedundancy
This status message indicates your cluster has too many control plane nodes:

status:
  clusterHealth: green
  conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: '2019-04-17T20:12:34Z'
      message: >-
        Invalid master nodes count. Please ensure there are no more than 3 total
        nodes with master roles
      reason: Invalid Settings
      status: 'True'
      type: InvalidMasters
The following status message indicates that Elasticsearch storage does not support the change you tried to make.

For example:

status:
  clusterHealth: green
  conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: "2021-05-07T01:05:13Z"
      message: Changing the storage structure for a custom resource is not supported
      reason: StorageStructureChangeIgnored
      status: 'True'
      type: StorageStructureChangeIgnored
The reason and type fields specify the type of unsupported change:


StorageClassNameChangeIgnored
Unsupported change to the storage class name.
StorageSizeChangeIgnored
Unsupported change the storage size.
StorageStructureChangeIgnored
Unsupported change between ephemeral and persistent storage structures.
Viewing the status of the log store components
You can view the status for a number of the log store components.


Elasticsearch indices
You can view the status of the Elasticsearch indices.
Log store pods
You can view the status of the pods that host the log store.
Log storage pod deployment configuration
You can view the status of the log store deployment configuration.
Log store replica set

Elasticsearch cluster status
A dashboard in the Observe section of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console displays the status of the Elasticsearch cluster.

To get the status of the OpenShift Elasticsearch cluster, visit the dashboard in the Observe section of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console at <cluster_url>/monitoring/dashboards/grafana-dashboard-cluster-logging.


eo_elasticsearch_cr_cluster_management_state
Shows whether the Elasticsearch cluster is in a managed or unmanaged state. For example:
eo_elasticsearch_cr_restart_total
Shows the number of times the Elasticsearch nodes have restarted for certificate restarts, rolling restarts, or scheduled restarts. For example:
es_index_namespaces_total
Shows the total number of Elasticsearch index namespaces. For example:
es_index_document_count
Shows the number of records for each namespace. For example:


If Elasticsearch is missing the admin-cert, admin-key, logging-es.crt, or logging-es.key files, the dashboard shows a status message similar to the following example:

message": "Secret \"elasticsearch\" fields are either missing or empty: [admin-cert, admin-key, logging-es.crt, logging-es.key]",
"reason": "Missing Required Secrets",
