Log output types

Outputs define the destination where logs are sent to from a log forwarder. You can configure multiple types of outputs in the ClusterLogForwarder custom resource (CR) to send logs to servers that support different protocols.
Supported log forwarding outputs
Outputs can be any of the following types:


Fluentd does not support Elasticsearch 8 in the logging version 5.6.2.

Vector supports Syslog in the logging version 5.7 and higher.
