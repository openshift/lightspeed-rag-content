# Fixed issues

Resolved issue with TLS certificates affecting Tempo pods:: Before this update, the Tempo pods would stop to communicate because internal TLS certificates were renewed. With this update, the Tempo pods automatically restart when certificates are renewed.

TRACING-5622
Tempo query frontend no longer fails to fetch trace JSON:: Before this update, clicking on Trace in the Jaeger UI and refreshing the page, or accessing Trace -> Trace Timeline -> Trace JSON from the Tempo query frontend, might result in the Tempo query pod failing with an EOF error. With this update, this issue is resolved.
