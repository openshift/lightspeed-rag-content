# Removing



[WARNING]
----
The Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) 3.5 is the last release of the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) that Red Hat plans to support.
In the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform 3.5, Jaeger and support for Elasticsearch remain deprecated.
Support for the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) ends on November 3, 2025.
The Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform Operator (Jaeger) will be removed from the redhat-operators catalog on November 3, 2025. For more information, see the Red Hat Knowledgebase solution Jaeger Deprecation and Removal in OpenShift.
You must migrate to the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator and the Tempo Operator for distributed tracing collection and storage. For more information, see "Migrating" in the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry documentation, "Installing" in the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry documentation, and "Installing" in the distributed tracing platform (Tempo) documentation.
----
The steps for removing Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform from an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster are as follows:
1. Shut down any Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform pods.
2. Remove any Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform instances.
3. Remove the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator.
4. Remove the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator.

# Removing a distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) instance by using the web console

You can remove a distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) instance in the Administrator view of the web console.


[WARNING]
----
When deleting an instance that uses in-memory storage, all data is irretrievably lost. Data stored in persistent storage such as Elasticsearch is not deleted when a Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) instance is removed.
----

* You are logged in to the web console as a cluster administrator with the cluster-admin role.

1. Log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.
2. Navigate to Operators -> Installed Operators.
3. Select the name of the project where the Operators are installed from the Project menu, for example, openshift-operators.
4. Click the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator.
5. Click the Jaeger tab.
6. Click the Options menu . next to the instance you want to delete and select Delete Jaeger.
7. In the confirmation message, click Delete.

# Removing a distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) instance by using the CLI

You can remove a distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) instance on the command line.

* An active OpenShift CLI (`oc`) session by a cluster administrator with the cluster-admin role.

[TIP]
----
* Ensure that your OpenShift CLI (`oc`) version is up to date and matches your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version.
* Run oc login:

```terminal
$ oc login --username=<your_username>
```

----

1. Log in with the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc login --username=<NAMEOFUSER>
```

2. To display the distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) instances, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get deployments -n <jaeger-project>
```


For example,

```terminal
$ oc get deployments -n openshift-operators
```


The names of Operators have the suffix -operator. The following example shows two Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operators and four distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) instances:

```terminal
$ oc get deployments -n openshift-operators
```


You will see output similar to the following:

```terminal
NAME                     READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
elasticsearch-operator   1/1     1            1           93m
jaeger-operator          1/1     1            1           49m
jaeger-test              1/1     1            1           7m23s
jaeger-test2             1/1     1            1           6m48s
tracing1                 1/1     1            1           7m8s
tracing2                 1/1     1            1           35m
```

3. To remove an instance of distributed tracing platform (Jaeger), run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete jaeger <deployment-name> -n <jaeger-project>
```


For example:

```terminal
$ oc delete jaeger tracing2 -n openshift-operators
```

4. To verify the deletion, run the oc get deployments command again:

```terminal
$ oc get deployments -n <jaeger-project>
```


For example:

```terminal
$ oc get deployments -n openshift-operators
```


You will see generated output that is similar to the following example:

```terminal
NAME                     READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
elasticsearch-operator   1/1     1            1           94m
jaeger-operator          1/1     1            1           50m
jaeger-test              1/1     1            1           8m14s
jaeger-test2             1/1     1            1           7m39s
tracing1                 1/1     1            1           7m59s
```


# Removing the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform Operators

1. Follow the instructions in Deleting Operators from a cluster to remove the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator.
2. Optional: After the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator has been removed, remove the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator.
