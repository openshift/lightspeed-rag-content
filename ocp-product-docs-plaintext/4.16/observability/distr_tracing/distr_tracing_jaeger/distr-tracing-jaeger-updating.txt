# Upgrading



[WARNING]
----
The Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) 3.5 is the last release of the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) that Red Hat plans to support.
In the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform 3.5, Jaeger and support for Elasticsearch remain deprecated.
Support for the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) ends on November 3, 2025.
The Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform Operator (Jaeger) will be removed from the redhat-operators catalog on November 3, 2025. For more information, see the Red Hat Knowledgebase solution Jaeger Deprecation and Removal in OpenShift.
You must migrate to the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator and the Tempo Operator for distributed tracing collection and storage. For more information, see "Migrating" in the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry documentation, "Installing" in the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry documentation, and "Installing" in the distributed tracing platform (Tempo) documentation.
----
Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) controls the installation, upgrade, and role-based access control (RBAC) of Operators in a cluster. The OLM runs by default in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
OLM queries for available Operators as well as upgrades for installed Operators.
During an update, the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform Operators upgrade the managed distributed tracing platform instances to the version associated with the Operator. Whenever a new version of the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator is installed, all the distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) application instances managed by the Operator are upgraded to the Operator's version. For example, after upgrading the Operator from 1.10 installed to 1.11, the Operator scans for running distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) instances and upgrades them to 1.11 as well.

[IMPORTANT]
----
If you have not already updated your OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator as described in Updating OpenShift Logging, complete that update before updating your Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator.
