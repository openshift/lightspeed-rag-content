# Forwarding traces to a TempoStack instance

To configure forwarding traces to a TempoStack instance, you can deploy and configure the OpenTelemetry Collector. You can deploy the OpenTelemetry Collector in the deployment mode by using the specified processors, receivers, and exporters. For other modes, see the OpenTelemetry Collector documentation linked in Additional resources.

* The Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator is installed.
* The Tempo Operator is installed.
* A TempoStack instance is deployed on the cluster.

1. Create a service account for the OpenTelemetry Collector.
Example ServiceAccount

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: otel-collector-deployment
```

2. Create a cluster role for the service account.
Example ClusterRole

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: otel-collector
rules:
  1
  2
- apiGroups: ["", "config.openshift.io"]
  resources: ["pods", "namespaces", "infrastructures", "infrastructures/status"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
```

The k8sattributesprocessor requires permissions for pods and namespaces resources.
The resourcedetectionprocessor requires permissions for infrastructures and status.
3. Bind the cluster role to the service account.
Example ClusterRoleBinding

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: otel-collector
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: otel-collector-deployment
  namespace: otel-collector-example
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: otel-collector
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

4. Create the YAML file to define the OpenTelemetryCollector custom resource (CR).
Example OpenTelemetryCollector

```yaml
apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpenTelemetryCollector
metadata:
  name: otel
spec:
  mode: deployment
  serviceAccount: otel-collector-deployment
  config: |
    receivers:
      jaeger:
        protocols:
          grpc:
          thrift_binary:
          thrift_compact:
          thrift_http:
      opencensus:
      otlp:
        protocols:
          grpc:
          http:
      zipkin:
    processors:
      batch:
      k8sattributes:
      memory_limiter:
        check_interval: 1s
        limit_percentage: 50
        spike_limit_percentage: 30
      resourcedetection:
        detectors: [openshift]
    exporters:
      otlp:
        endpoint: "tempo-simplest-distributor:4317" 1
        tls:
          insecure: true
    service:
      pipelines:
        traces:
          receivers: [jaeger, opencensus, otlp, zipkin] 2
          processors: [memory_limiter, k8sattributes, resourcedetection, batch]
          exporters: [otlp]
```

The Collector exporter is configured to export OTLP and points to the Tempo distributor endpoint, "tempo-simplest-distributor:4317" in this example, which is already created.
The Collector is configured with a receiver for Jaeger traces, OpenCensus traces over the OpenCensus protocol, Zipkin traces over the Zipkin protocol, and OTLP traces over the GRPC protocol.


[TIP]
----
You can deploy telemetrygen as a test:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: telemetrygen
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: telemetrygen
          image: ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/telemetrygen:latest
          args:
            - traces
            - --otlp-endpoint=otel-collector:4317
            - --otlp-insecure
            - --duration=30s
            - --workers=1
      restartPolicy: Never
  backoffLimit: 4
```
