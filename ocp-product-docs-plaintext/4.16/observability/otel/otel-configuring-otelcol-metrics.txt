# Configuring the OpenTelemetry Collector metrics

The following list shows some of these metrics:

* Collector memory usage
* CPU utilization
* Number of active traces and spans processed
* Dropped spans, logs, or metrics
* Exporter and receiver statistics

The Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator automatically creates a service named <instance_name>-collector-monitoring that exposes the Collector&#8217;s internal metrics. This service listens on port 8888 by default.

You can use these metrics for monitoring the Collector&#8217;s performance, resource consumption, and other internal behaviors. You can also use a Prometheus instance or another monitoring tool to scrape these metrics from the mentioned <instance_name>-collector-monitoring service.


[NOTE]
----
When the spec.observability.metrics.enableMetrics field in the OpenTelemetryCollector custom resource (CR) is set to true, the OpenTelemetryCollector CR automatically creates a Prometheus ServiceMonitor or PodMonitor CR to enable Prometheus to scrape your metrics.
----

* Monitoring for user-defined projects is enabled in the cluster.

* To enable metrics of an OpenTelemetry Collector instance, set the spec.observability.metrics.enableMetrics field to true:

```yaml
apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpenTelemetryCollector
metadata:
  name: <name>
spec:
  observability:
    metrics:
      enableMetrics: true
```


You can use the Administrator view of the web console to verify successful configuration:

1. Go to Observe -> Targets.
2. Filter by Source: User.
3. Check that the ServiceMonitors or PodMonitors in the opentelemetry-collector-<instance_name> format have the Up status.
