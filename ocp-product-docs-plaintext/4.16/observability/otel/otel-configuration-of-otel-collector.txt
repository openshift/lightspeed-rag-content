# Configuring the Collector


The Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator uses a custom resource definition (CRD) file that defines the architecture and configuration settings to be used when creating and deploying the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry resources. You can install the default configuration or modify the file.

# OpenTelemetry Collector configuration options

The OpenTelemetry Collector consists of five types of components that access telemetry data:

Receivers:: A receiver, which can be push or pull based, is how data gets into the Collector. Generally, a receiver accepts data in a specified format, translates it into the internal format, and passes it to processors and exporters defined in the applicable pipelines. By default, no receivers are configured. One or more receivers must be configured. Receivers may support one or more data sources.
Processors:: Optional. Processors process the data between it is received and exported. By default, no processors are enabled. Processors must be enabled for every data source. Not all processors support all data sources. Depending on the data source, multiple processors might be enabled. Note that the order of processors matters.
Exporters:: An exporter, which can be push or pull based, is how you send data to one or more back ends or destinations. By default, no exporters are configured. One or more exporters must be configured. Exporters can support one or more data sources. Exporters might be used with their default settings, but many exporters require configuration to specify at least the destination and security settings.
Connectors:: A connector connects two pipelines. It consumes data as an exporter at the end of one pipeline and emits data as a receiver at the start of another pipeline. It can consume and emit data of the same or different data type. It can generate and emit data to summarize the consumed data, or it can merely replicate or route data.
Extensions:: An extension adds capabilities to the Collector. For example, authentication can be added to the receivers and exporters automatically.

You can define multiple instances of components in a custom resource YAML file. When configured, these components must be enabled through pipelines defined in the spec.config.service section of the YAML file. As a best practice, only enable the components that you need.


```yaml
apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpenTelemetryCollector

  name: cluster-collector
  namespace: tracing-system
spec:
  mode: deployment

    receivers:
      k8s_events:
        namespaces: [project1, project2] 2
    service:
      pipelines:
        logs:
          receivers: [k8s_events]
```


The service account of the Collector that has the required ClusterRole otel-collector RBAC.
The list of namespaces to collect events from. The default value is empty, which means that all namespaces are collected.

## Processors

Processors run through the data between it is received and exported.

### Batch Processor

The Batch Processor batches traces and metrics to reduce the number of outgoing connections needed to transfer the telemetry information.


```yaml
  config: |
    processor:
      batch:
        timeout: 5s
        send_batch_max_size: 10000
    service:
      pipelines:
        traces:
          processors: [batch]
        metrics:
          processors: [batch]
```




### Memory Limiter Processor

The Memory Limiter Processor periodically checks the Collector&#8217;s memory usage and pauses data processing when the soft memory limit is reached. This processor supports traces, metrics, and logs. The preceding component, which is typically a receiver, is expected to retry sending the same data and may apply a backpressure to the incoming data. When memory usage exceeds the hard limit, the Memory Limiter Processor forces garbage collection to run.


```yaml
  config: |
    processor:
      memory_limiter:
        check_interval: 1s
        limit_mib: 4000
        spike_limit_mib: 800
    service:
      pipelines:
        traces:
          processors: [batch]
        metrics:
          processors: [batch]
```




### Resource Detection Processor

The Resource Detection Processor is currently a Technology Preview feature only.

The Resource Detection Processor identifies host resource details in alignment with OpenTelemetry&#8217;s resource semantic standards. Using the detected information, this processor can add or replace the resource values in telemetry data. This processor supports traces and metrics. You can use this processor with multiple detectors such as the Docket metadata detector or the OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES environment variable detector.


```yaml
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: otel-collector
rules:
- apiGroups: ["config.openshift.io"]
  resources: ["infrastructures", "infrastructures/status"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
```



```yaml
  config: |
    processor:
      resourcedetection:
        detectors: [openshift]
        override: true
    service:
      pipelines:
        traces:
          processors: [resourcedetection]
        metrics:
          processors: [resourcedetection]
```



```yaml
  config: |
    processors:
      resourcedetection/env:
        detectors: [env] 1
        timeout: 2s
        override: false
```


Specifies which detector to use. In this example, the environment detector is specified.

### Attributes Processor

The Attributes Processor is currently a Technology Preview feature only.

The Attributes Processor can modify attributes of a span, log, or metric. You can configure this processor to filter and match input data and include or exclude such data for specific actions.

This processor operates on a list of actions, executing them in the order specified in the configuration. The following actions are supported:

Insert:: Inserts a new attribute into the input data when the specified key does not already exist.
Update:: Updates an attribute in the input data if the key already exists.
Upsert:: Combines the insert and update actions: Inserts a new attribute if the key does not exist yet. Updates the attribute if the key already exists.
Delete:: Removes an attribute from the input data.
Hash:: Hashes an existing attribute value as SHA1.
Extract:: Extracts values by using a regular expression rule from the input key to the target keys defined in the rule. If a target key already exists, it is overridden similarly to the Span Processor's to_attributes setting with the existing attribute as the source.
Convert:: Converts an existing attribute to a specified type.


```yaml
  config: |
    processors:
      attributes/example:
        actions:
          - key: db.table
            action: delete
          - key: redacted_span
            value: true
            action: upsert
          - key: copy_key
            from_attribute: key_original
            action: update
          - key: account_id
            value: 2245
            action: insert
          - key: account_password
            action: delete
          - key: account_email
            action: hash
          - key: http.status_code
            action: convert
            converted_type: int
```


### Resource Processor

The Resource Processor is currently a Technology Preview feature only.

The Resource Processor applies changes to the resource attributes. This processor supports traces, metrics, and logs.


```yaml
  config: |
    processor:
      attributes:
      - key: cloud.availability_zone
        value: "zone-1"
        action: upsert
      - key: k8s.cluster.name
        from_attribute: k8s-cluster
        action: insert
      - key: redundant-attribute
        action: delete
```


Attributes represent the actions that are applied to the resource attributes, such as delete the attribute, insert the attribute, or upsert the attribute.

### Span Processor

The Span Processor is currently a Technology Preview feature only.

The Span Processor modifies the span name based on its attributes or extracts the span attributes from the span name. This processor can also change the span status and include or exclude spans. This processor supports traces.

Span renaming requires specifying attributes for the new name by using the from_attributes configuration.


```yaml
  config: |
    processor:
      span:
        name:
          from_attributes: [<key1>, <key2>, ...] 1
          separator: <value> 2
```


Defines the keys to form the new span name.
An optional separator.

You can use this processor to extract attributes from the span name.


```yaml
  config: |
    processor:
      span/to_attributes:
        name:
          to_attributes:
            rules:
              - ^\/api\/v1\/document\/(?P<documentId>.*)\/update$ 1
```


This rule defines how the extraction is to be executed. You can define more rules: for example, in this case, if the regular expression matches the name, a documentID attibute is created. In this example, if the input span name is /api/v1/document/12345678/update, this results in the /api/v1/document/{documentId}/update output span name, and a new "documentId"="12345678" attribute is added to the span.

You can have the span status modified.


```yaml
  config: |
    processor:
      span/set_status:
        status:
          code: Error
          description: "<error_description>"
```


### Kubernetes Attributes Processor

The Kubernetes Attributes Processor is currently a Technology Preview feature only.

The Kubernetes Attributes Processor enables automatic configuration of spans, metrics, and log resource attributes by using the Kubernetes metadata.
This processor supports traces, metrics, and logs.
This processor automatically identifies the Kubernetes resources, extracts the metadata from them, and incorporates this extracted metadata as resource attributes into relevant spans, metrics, and logs. It utilizes the Kubernetes API to discover all pods operating within a cluster, maintaining records of their IP addresses, pod UIDs, and other relevant metadata.


```yaml
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: otel-collector
rules:
  - apiGroups: ['']
    resources: ['pods', 'namespaces']
    verbs: ['get', 'watch', 'list']
```



```yaml
  config: |
    processors:
         k8sattributes:
             filter:
                 node_from_env_var: KUBE_NODE_NAME
```


### Filter Processor

The Filter Processor is currently a Technology Preview feature only.

The Filter Processor leverages the OpenTelemetry Transformation Language to establish criteria for discarding telemetry data. If any of these conditions are satisfied, the telemetry data are discarded. You can combine the conditions by using the logical OR operator. This processor supports traces, metrics, and logs.


```yaml
config: |
  processors:
    filter/ottl:
      error_mode: ignore 1
      traces:
        span:
          - 'attributes["container.name"] == "app_container_1"' 2
          - 'resource.attributes["host.name"] == "localhost"' 3
```


Defines the error mode. When set to ignore, ignores errors returned by conditions. When set to propagate, returns the error up the pipeline. An error causes the payload to be dropped from the Collector.
Filters the spans that have the container.name == app_container_1 attribute.
Filters the spans that have the host.name == localhost resource attribute.

### Routing Processor

The Routing Processor is currently a Technology Preview feature only.

The Routing Processor routes logs, metrics, or traces to specific exporters. This processor can read a header from an incoming gRPC or plain HTTP request or read a resource attribute, and then direct the trace information to relevant exporters according to the read value.


```yaml
config: |
  processors:
    routing:
      from_attribute: X-Tenant 1
      default_exporters: 2
      - jaeger
      table: 3
      - value: acme
        exporters: [jaeger/acme]
  exporters:
    jaeger:
      endpoint: localhost:14250
    jaeger/acme:
      endpoint: localhost:24250
```


The HTTP header name for the lookup value when performing the route.
The default exporter when the attribute value is not present in the table in the next section.
The table that defines which values are to be routed to which exporters.

You can optionally create an attribute_source configuration, which defines where to look for the attribute in from_attribute. The allowed value is context to search the context, which includes the HTTP headers, or resource to search the resource attributes.

### Cumulative to Delta Processor

This processor converts monotonic, cumulative-sum, and histogram metrics to monotonic delta metrics.

You can filter metrics by using the include: or exclude: fields and specifying the strict or regexp metric name matching.

This processor does not convert non-monotonic sums and exponential histograms.

      exclude: 4
        match_type: regexp
        metrics:
        - "<regular_expression_for_metric_names>"
```


Optional: Configures which metrics to include. When omitted, all metrics, except for those listed in the exclude field, are converted to delta metrics.
Defines a value provided in the metrics field as a strict exact match or regexp regular expression.
Lists the metric names, which are exact matches or matches for regular expressions, of the metrics to be converted to delta metrics. If a metric matches both the include and exclude filters, the exclude filter takes precedence.
Optional: Configures which metrics to exclude. When omitted, no metrics are excluded from conversion to delta metrics.

## Exporters

Exporters send data to one or more back ends or destinations.

### OTLP Exporter

The OTLP gRPC Exporter exports traces and metrics by using the OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP).


```yaml
  config: |
    exporters:
      otlp:

```


The OTLP HTTP endpoint. If the https:// scheme is used, then client transport security is enabled and overrides the insecure setting in the tls.
The client side TLS configuration. Defines paths to TLS certificates.
Headers are sent in every HTTP request.
If true, disables HTTP keep-alives. It will only use the connection to the server for a single HTTP request.

### Debug Exporter

The Debug Exporter prints traces and metrics to the standard output.


```yaml
  config: |
    exporters:
      debug:
        verbosity: detailed 1

The OAuth2Client Extension is an authenticator for exporters that are based on the HTTP and the gRPC protocol.
Client authentication for the OAuth2Client Extension is configured in a separate section in the OpenTelemetry Collector custom resource.
This extension supports traces, metrics, and logs.


```yaml
  config: |
    extensions:
      oauth2client:
        client_id: <client_id> 1
        client_secret: <client_secret> 2
        endpoint_params: 3
          audience: <audience>
        token_url: https://example.com/oauth2/default/v1/token 4
        scopes: ["api.metrics"] 5
        # tls settings for the token client
        tls: 6
          insecure: true 7
          ca_file: /var/lib/mycert.pem 8
          cert_file: <cert_file> 9
          key_file: <key_file> 10
        timeout: 2s 11

    receivers:
      otlp:
        protocols:
          http: {}

    exporters:
      otlp:
        auth:
          authenticator: oauth2client 12

    service:
      extensions: [oauth2client]
      pipelines:
        traces:
          receivers: [otlp]
          exporters: [otlp]
```


Client identifier, which is provided by the identity provider.
Confidential key used to authenticate the client to the identity provider.
Further metadata, in the key-value pair format, which is transferred during authentication. For example, audience specifies the intended audience for the access token, indicating the recipient of the token.
The URL of the OAuth2 token endpoint, where the Collector requests access tokens.
The scopes define the specific permissions or access levels requested by the client.
The Transport Layer Security (TLS) settings for the token client, which is used to establish a secure connection when requesting tokens.
When set to true, configures the Collector to use an insecure or non-verified TLS connection to call the configured token endpoint.
The path to a Certificate Authority (CA) file that is used to verify the server's certificate during the TLS handshake.
The path to the client certificate file that the client must use to authenticate itself to the OAuth2 server if required.
The path to the client's private key file that is used with the client certificate if needed for authentication.
Sets a timeout for the token client's request.
You can assign the authenticator configuration to an OTLP exporter.

The File Storage Extension supports traces, metrics, and logs. This extension can persist the state to the local file system. This extension persists the sending queue for the OTLP exporters that are based on the HTTP and the gRPC protocols. This extension requires the read and write access to a directory. This extension can use a default directory, but the default directory must already exist.


```yaml
  config: |
    extensions:
      file_storage/all_settings:
        directory: /var/lib/otelcol/mydir 1
        timeout: 1s 2
        compaction:
          on_start: true 3
          directory: /tmp/ 4
          max_transaction_size: 65_536 5
        fsync: false 6

    exporters:
      otlp:
        sending_queue:
          storage: file_storage/all_settings

    service:
      extensions: [file_storage/all_settings]
      pipelines:
        traces:
          receivers: [otlp]
          exporters: [otlp]
```


Specifies the directory in which the telemetry data is stored.
Specifies the timeout time interval for opening the stored files.
Starts compaction when the Collector starts. If omitted, the default is false.
Specifies the directory in which the compactor stores the telemetry data.
Defines the maximum size of the compaction transaction. To ignore the transaction size, set to zero. If omitted, the default is 65536 bytes.
When set, forces the database to perform an fsync call after each write operation. This helps to ensure database integrity if there is an interruption to the database process, but at the cost of performance.

The target allocator is an optional component of the OpenTelemetry Operator that shards scrape targets across the deployed fleet of OpenTelemetry Collector instances. The target allocator integrates with the Prometheus PodMonitor and ServiceMonitor custom resources (CR). When the target allocator is enabled, the OpenTelemetry Operator adds the http_sd_config field to the enabled prometheus receiver that connects to the target allocator service.


```yaml
apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpenTelemetryCollector
metadata:
  name: otel
  namespace: observability
spec:
  mode: statefulset 1
  targetAllocator:
    enabled: true 2
    serviceAccount: 3
    prometheusCR:
      enabled: true 4
      scrapeInterval: 10s
      serviceMonitorSelector: 5
        name: app1
      podMonitorSelector: 6
        name: app2
  config: |
    receivers:
      prometheus: 7
        config:
          scrape_configs: []
    processors:
    exporters:
      debug: {}
    service:
      pipelines:
        metrics:
          receivers: [prometheus]
          processors: []
          exporters: [debug]
```


When the target allocator is enabled, the deployment mode must be set to statefulset.
Enables the target allocator. Defaults to false.
The service account name of the target allocator deployment. The service account needs to have RBAC to get the ServiceMonitor, PodMonitor custom resources, and other objects from the cluster to properly set labels on scraped metrics. The default service name is <collector_name>-targetallocator.
Enables integration with the Prometheus PodMonitor and ServiceMonitor custom resources.
Label selector for the Prometheus ServiceMonitor custom resources. When left empty, enables all service monitors.
Label selector for the Prometheus PodMonitor custom resources. When left empty, enables all pod monitors.
Prometheus receiver with the minimal, empty scrape_config: [] configuration option.

The target allocator deployment uses the Kubernetes API to get relevant objects from the cluster, so it requires a custom RBAC configuration.


```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: otel-targetallocator
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources:
      - services
