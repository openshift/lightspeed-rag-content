# Extensions


Extensions add capabilities to the Collector. For example, authentication can be added to the receivers and exporters automatically.
Currently, the following General Availability and Technology Preview extensions are available for the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry:
* BearerTokenAuth Extension
* OAuth2Client Extension
* File Storage Extension
* OIDC Auth Extension
* Jaeger Remote Sampling Extension
* Performance Profiler Extension
* Health Check Extension
* zPages Extension

# BearerTokenAuth Extension

The BearerTokenAuth Extension is an authenticator for receivers and exporters that are based on the HTTP and the gRPC protocol.
You can use the OpenTelemetry Collector custom resource to configure client authentication and server authentication for the BearerTokenAuth Extension on the receiver and exporter side.
This extension supports traces, metrics, and logs.


```yaml
# ...
  config: |
    extensions:
      bearertokenauth:
        scheme: "Bearer" 1
        token: "<token>" 2
        filename: "<token_file>" 3

    receivers:
      otlp:
        protocols:
          http:
            auth:
              authenticator: bearertokenauth 4
    exporters:
      otlp:
        auth:
          authenticator: bearertokenauth 5

    service:
      extensions: [bearertokenauth]
      pipelines:
        traces:
          receivers: [otlp]
          exporters: [otlp]
# ...
```


You can configure the BearerTokenAuth Extension to send a custom scheme. The default is Bearer.
You can add the BearerTokenAuth Extension token as metadata to identify a message.
Path to a file that contains an authorization token that is transmitted with every message.
You can assign the authenticator configuration to an OTLP Receiver.
You can assign the authenticator configuration to an OTLP Exporter.

# OAuth2Client Extension

The OAuth2Client Extension is an authenticator for exporters that are based on the HTTP and the gRPC protocol.
Client authentication for the OAuth2Client Extension is configured in a separate section in the OpenTelemetry Collector custom resource.
This extension supports traces, metrics, and logs.

# ...
```


Client identifier, which is provided by the identity provider.
Confidential key used to authenticate the client to the identity provider.
Further metadata, in the key-value pair format, which is transferred during authentication. For example, audience specifies the intended audience for the access token, indicating the recipient of the token.
The URL of the OAuth2 token endpoint, where the Collector requests access tokens.
The scopes define the specific permissions or access levels requested by the client.
The Transport Layer Security (TLS) settings for the token client, which is used to establish a secure connection when requesting tokens.
When set to true, configures the Collector to use an insecure or non-verified TLS connection to call the configured token endpoint.
The path to a Certificate Authority (CA) file that is used to verify the server's certificate during the TLS handshake.
The path to the client certificate file that the client must use to authenticate itself to the OAuth2 server if required.
The path to the client's private key file that is used with the client certificate if needed for authentication.
Sets a timeout for the token client's request.
You can assign the authenticator configuration to an OTLP exporter.

# File Storage Extension

The File Storage Extension supports traces, metrics, and logs. This extension can persist the state to the local file system. This extension persists the sending queue for the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) exporters that are based on the HTTP and the gRPC protocols. This extension requires the read and write access to a directory. This extension can use a default directory, but the default directory must already exist.

Specifies the directory in which the telemetry data is stored.
Specifies the timeout time interval for opening the stored files.
Starts compaction when the Collector starts. If omitted, the default is false.

Defines the maximum size of the compaction transaction. To ignore the transaction size, set to zero. If omitted, the default is 65536 bytes.
When set, forces the database to perform an fsync call after each write operation. This helps to ensure database integrity if there is an interruption to the database process, but at the cost of performance.
Buffers the OTLP Exporter data on the local file system.
Starts the File Storage Extension by the Collector.

# OIDC Auth Extension

The OIDC Auth Extension authenticates incoming requests to receivers by using the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol.
It validates the ID token in the authorization header against the issuer and updates the authentication context of the incoming request.

Specifies the HTTP endpoint for serving the zPages extension. The default is localhost:55679.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Accessing the HTTP endpoint requires port-forwarding because the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator does not expose this route.
You can enable port-forwarding by running the following oc command:

```terminal
$ oc port-forward pod/$(oc get pod -l app.kubernetes.io/name=instance-collector -o=jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') 55679
```

----

The Collector provides the following zPages for diagnostics:

ServiceZ:: Shows an overview of the Collector services and links to the following zPages: PipelineZ, ExtensionZ, and FeatureZ. This page also displays information about the build version and runtime. An example of this page's URL is http://localhost:55679/debug/servicez.
PipelineZ:: Shows detailed information about the active pipelines in the Collector. This page displays the pipeline type, whether data are modified, and the associated receivers, processors, and exporters for each pipeline. An example of this page's URL is http://localhost:55679/debug/pipelinez.
ExtensionZ:: Shows the currently active extensions in the Collector. An example of this page's URL is http://localhost:55679/debug/extensionz.
FeatureZ:: Shows the feature gates enabled in the Collector along with their status and description. An example of this page's URL is http://localhost:55679/debug/featurez.
TraceZ:: Shows spans categorized by latency. Available time ranges include 0 µs, 10 µs, 100 µs, 1 ms, 10 ms, 100 ms, 1 s, 10 s, 1 m. This page also allows for quick inspection of error samples. An example of this page's URL is http://localhost:55679/debug/tracez.
