# Configuring alerts and notifications for user workload monitoring


You can configure a local or external Alertmanager instance to route alerts from Prometheus to endpoint receivers. You can also attach custom labels to all time series and alerts to add useful metadata information.

# Configuring external Alertmanager instances

The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring stack includes a local Alertmanager instance that routes alerts from Prometheus.

You can add external Alertmanager instances to route alerts for user-defined projects.

If you add the same external Alertmanager configuration for multiple clusters and disable the local instance for each cluster, you can then manage alert routing for multiple clusters by using a single external Alertmanager instance.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role or as a user with the user-workload-monitoring-config-edit role in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project.
* A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Edit the {configmap-name} config map in the {namespace-name} project:

```terminal
$ oc -n {namespace-name} edit configmap {configmap-name}
```

2. Add an additionalAlertmanagerConfigs section with configuration details under
data/config.yaml/<component>:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {configmap-name}
  namespace: {namespace-name}
data:
  config.yaml: |
    <component>: 2
      additionalAlertmanagerConfigs:
      - <alertmanager_specification> 1
```

Substitute <alertmanager_specification> with authentication and other configuration details for additional Alertmanager instances.
Currently supported authentication methods are bearer token (bearerToken) and client TLS (tlsConfig).
Substitute <component> for one of two supported external Alertmanager components: prometheus or thanosRuler.

The following sample config map configures an additional Alertmanager for {component-name} by using a bearer token with client TLS authentication:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {configmap-name}
  namespace: {namespace-name}
data:
  config.yaml: |
    {component}:
      additionalAlertmanagerConfigs:
      - scheme: https
        pathPrefix: /
        timeout: "30s"
        apiVersion: v1
        bearerToken:
          name: alertmanager-bearer-token
          key: token
        tlsConfig:
          key:
            name: alertmanager-tls
            key: tls.key
          cert:
            name: alertmanager-tls
            key: tls.crt
          ca:
            name: alertmanager-tls
            key: tls.ca
        staticConfigs:
        - external-alertmanager1-remote.com
        - external-alertmanager1-remote2.com
```

3. Save the file to apply the changes. The pods affected by the new configuration are automatically redeployed.

# Configuring secrets for Alertmanager

The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring stack includes Alertmanager, which routes alerts from Prometheus to endpoint receivers.
If you need to authenticate with a receiver so that Alertmanager can send alerts to it, you can configure Alertmanager to use a secret that contains authentication credentials for the receiver.

For example, you can configure Alertmanager to use a secret to authenticate with an endpoint receiver that requires a certificate issued by a private Certificate Authority (CA).
You can also configure Alertmanager to use a secret to authenticate with a receiver that requires a password file for Basic HTTP authentication.
In either case, authentication details are contained in the Secret object rather than in the ConfigMap object.

## Adding a secret to the Alertmanager configuration

You can add secrets to the Alertmanager configuration by editing the {configmap-name} config map in the {namespace-name} project.

After you add a secret to the config map, the secret is mounted as a volume at /etc/alertmanager/secrets/<secret_name> within the alertmanager container for the Alertmanager pods.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role or as a user with the user-workload-monitoring-config-edit role in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project.
* A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You have created the secret to be configured in Alertmanager in the {namespace-name} project.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Edit the {configmap-name} config map in the {namespace-name} project:

```terminal
$ oc -n {namespace-name} edit configmap {configmap-name}
```

2. Add a secrets: section under data/config.yaml/{component} with the following configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {configmap-name}
  namespace: {namespace-name}
data:
  config.yaml: |
    {component}:
      secrets: 1
      - <secret_name_1> 2
      - <secret_name_2>
```

This section contains the secrets to be mounted into Alertmanager. The secrets must be located within the same namespace as the Alertmanager object.
The name of the Secret object that contains authentication credentials for the receiver. If you add multiple secrets, place each one on a new line.

The following sample config map settings configure Alertmanager to use two Secret objects named test-secret-basic-auth and test-secret-api-token:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {configmap-name}
  namespace: {namespace-name}
data:
  config.yaml: |
    {component}:
      secrets:
      - test-secret-basic-auth
      - test-secret-api-token
```

3. Save the file to apply the changes. The new configuration is applied automatically.

# Attaching additional labels to your time series and alerts

You can attach custom labels to all time series and alerts leaving Prometheus by using the external labels feature of Prometheus.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role or as a user with the user-workload-monitoring-config-edit role in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project.
* A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Edit the {configmap-name} config map in the {namespace-name} project:

```terminal
$ oc -n {namespace-name} edit configmap {configmap-name}
```

2. Define labels you want to add for every metric under data/config.yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {configmap-name}
  namespace: {namespace-name}
data:
  config.yaml: |
    {component}:
      externalLabels:
        <key>: <value> 1
```

Substitute <key>: <value> with key-value pairs where <key> is a unique name for the new label and <value> is its value.

[WARNING]
----
* Do not use prometheus or prometheus_replica as key names, because they are reserved and will be overwritten.
* Do not use cluster or managed_cluster as key names. Using them can cause issues where you are unable to see data in the developer dashboards.
----

[NOTE]
----
In the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project, Prometheus handles metrics and Thanos Ruler handles alerting and recording rules. Setting externalLabels for prometheus in the user-workload-monitoring-config ConfigMap object will only configure external labels for metrics and not for any rules.
----

For example, to add metadata about the region and environment to all time series and alerts, use the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {configmap-name}
  namespace: {namespace-name}
data:
  config.yaml: |
    {component}:
      externalLabels:
        region: eu
        environment: prod
```

3. Save the file to apply the changes. The pods affected by the new configuration are automatically redeployed.

* Enabling monitoring for user-defined projects

# Configuring alert notifications

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, an administrator can enable alert routing for user-defined projects with one of the following methods:

* Use the default platform Alertmanager instance.
* Use a separate Alertmanager instance only for user-defined projects.

Developers and other users with the alert-routing-edit cluster role can configure custom alert notifications for their user-defined projects by configuring alert receivers.


[NOTE]
----
Review the following limitations of alert routing for user-defined projects:
* User-defined alert routing is scoped to the namespace in which the resource is defined. For example, a routing configuration in namespace ns1 only applies to PrometheusRules resources in the same namespace.
* When a namespace is excluded from user-defined monitoring, AlertmanagerConfig resources in the namespace cease to be part of the Alertmanager configuration.

## Configuring alert routing for user-defined projects

If you are a non-administrator user who has been given the alert-routing-edit cluster role, you can create or edit alert routing for user-defined projects.

* A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* A cluster administrator has enabled alert routing for user-defined projects.
* You are logged in as a user that has the alert-routing-edit cluster role for the project for which you want to create alert routing.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Create a YAML file for alert routing. The example in this procedure uses a file called example-app-alert-routing.yaml.
2. Add an AlertmanagerConfig YAML definition to the file. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1beta1
kind: AlertmanagerConfig
metadata:
  name: example-routing
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  route:
    receiver: default
    groupBy: [job]
  receivers:
  - name: default
    webhookConfigs:
    - url: https://example.org/post
```

3. Save the file.
4. Apply the resource to the cluster:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f example-app-alert-routing.yaml
```


The configuration is automatically applied to the Alertmanager pods.

## Configuring alert routing for user-defined projects with the Alertmanager secret

If you have enabled a separate instance of Alertmanager that is dedicated to user-defined alert routing, you can customize where and how the instance sends notifications by editing the alertmanager-user-workload secret in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring namespace.


[NOTE]
----
All features of a supported version of upstream Alertmanager are also supported in an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Alertmanager configuration. To check all the configuration options of a supported version of upstream Alertmanager, see Alertmanager configuration (Prometheus documentation).
----

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin cluster role.
* You have enabled a separate instance of Alertmanager for user-defined alert routing.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Print the currently active Alertmanager configuration into the file alertmanager.yaml:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring get secret alertmanager-user-workload --template='{{ index .data "alertmanager.yaml" }}' | base64 --decode > alertmanager.yaml
```

2. Edit the configuration in alertmanager.yaml:

```yaml
route:
  receiver: Default
  group_by:
  - name: Default
  routes:
  - matchers:
    - "service = prometheus-example-monitor" 1
    receiver: <receiver> 2
receivers:
- name: Default
- name: <receiver>
  <receiver_configuration> 3
```

Specify labels to match your alerts. This example targets all alerts that have the service="prometheus-example-monitor" label.
Specify the name of the receiver to use for the alerts group.
Specify the receiver configuration.
3. Apply the new configuration in the file:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring create secret generic alertmanager-user-workload --from-file=alertmanager.yaml --dry-run=client -o=yaml |  oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring replace secret --filename=-
```


* Send test alerts to Alertmanager in OpenShift 4 (Red Hat Customer Portal)

## Configuring different alert receivers for default platform alerts and user-defined alerts

You can configure different alert receivers for default platform alerts and user-defined alerts to ensure the following results:

* All default platform alerts are sent to a receiver owned by the team in charge of these alerts.
* All user-defined alerts are sent to another receiver so that the team can focus only on platform alerts.

You can achieve this by using the openshift_io_alert_source="platform" label that is added by the Cluster Monitoring Operator to all platform alerts:

* Use the openshift_io_alert_source="platform" matcher to match default platform alerts.
* Use the openshift_io_alert_source!="platform" or 'openshift_io_alert_source=""' matcher to match user-defined alerts.


[NOTE]
----
This configuration does not apply if you have enabled a separate instance of Alertmanager dedicated to user-defined alerts.
