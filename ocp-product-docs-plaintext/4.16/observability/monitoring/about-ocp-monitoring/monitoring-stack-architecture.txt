# Monitoring stack architecture


The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
monitoring stack is based on the Prometheus open source project and its wider ecosystem. You can learn about the monitoring stack architecture, which includes default monitoring components and components for monitoring user-defined projects.

# Understanding the monitoring stack

The monitoring stack includes the following components:

Default platform monitoring components:: A set of platform monitoring components are installed in the openshift-monitoring project by default during an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation. This provides monitoring for core cluster components including Kubernetes services. The default monitoring stack also enables remote health monitoring for clusters.

You can see these components in the Installed by default section in the following diagram.
Components for monitoring user-defined projects:: If you enable monitoring for user-defined projects, additional monitoring components are installed in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project. This provides optional monitoring for user-defined projects.

You can see these components in the User section in the following diagram.



# Default monitoring components

By default, the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 monitoring stack includes the following components:



The monitoring stack monitors all components within the stack. The components are automatically updated when Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is updated.


[NOTE]
----
All components of the monitoring stack use the TLS security profile settings that are centrally configured by a cluster administrator.
If you configure a monitoring stack component that uses TLS security settings, the component uses the TLS security profile settings that already exist in the tlsSecurityProfile field in the global Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform apiservers.config.openshift.io/cluster resource.
----

## Default monitoring targets

In addition to the components of the stack itself, the default monitoring stack monitors additional platform components.

The following are examples of monitoring targets:

* CoreDNS
* etcd
* HAProxy
* Image registry
* Kubelets
* Kubernetes API server
* Kubernetes controller manager
* Kubernetes scheduler
* OpenShift API server
* OpenShift Controller Manager
* Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)


[NOTE]
----
* The exact list of targets can vary depending on your cluster capabilities and installed components.
* Each Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform component is responsible for its monitoring configuration. For problems with the monitoring of an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform component, open a
Jira issue against that component, not against the general monitoring component.
----

Other Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform framework components might be exposing metrics as well. For details, see their respective documentation.

# Components for monitoring user-defined projects

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
4.16
includes an optional enhancement to the monitoring stack that helps you monitor services and pods in user-defined projects. This feature includes the following components:




[NOTE]
----
The components in the preceding table are deployed after you enable monitoring for user-defined projects.
----

The monitoring stack monitors all components for user-defined projects. The components are automatically updated when Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is updated.

## Monitoring targets for user-defined projects

When monitoring is enabled for user-defined projects, you can monitor:

* Metrics provided through service endpoints in user-defined projects.
* Pods running in user-defined projects.

# The monitoring stack in high-availability clusters

By default, in multi-node clusters, the following components run in high-availability (HA) mode to prevent data loss and service interruption:

* Prometheus
* Alertmanager
* Thanos Ruler
* Thanos Querier
* Metrics Server
* Monitoring plugin

The component is replicated across two pods, each running on a separate node. This means that the monitoring stack can tolerate the loss of one pod.

Prometheus in HA mode:: 
* Both replicas independently scrape the same targets and evaluate the same rules.
* The replicas do not communicate with each other. Therefore, data might differ between the pods.
Alertmanager in HA mode:: 
* The two replicas synchronize notification and silence states with each other. This ensures that each notification is sent at least once.
* If the replicas fail to communicate or if there is an issue on the receiving side, notifications are still sent, but they might be duplicated.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Thanos Ruler are stateful components. To ensure high availability, you must configure them with persistent storage.

# Glossary of common terms for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring

This glossary defines common terms that are used in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform architecture.

Alertmanager:: Alertmanager handles alerts received from Prometheus. Alertmanager is also responsible for sending the alerts to external notification systems.
Alerting rules:: Alerting rules contain a set of conditions that outline a particular state within a cluster. Alerts are triggered when those conditions are true. An alerting rule can be assigned a severity that defines how the alerts are routed.
Cluster Monitoring Operator:: The Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO) is a central component of the monitoring stack. It deploys and manages Prometheus instances such as, the Thanos Querier, the Telemeter Client, and metrics targets to ensure that they are up to date. The CMO is deployed by the Cluster Version Operator (CVO).
Cluster Version Operator:: The Cluster Version Operator (CVO) manages the lifecycle of cluster Operators, many of which are installed in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform by default.
config map:: A config map provides a way to inject configuration data into pods. You can reference the data stored in a config map in a volume of type ConfigMap. Applications running in a pod can use this data.
Container:: A container is a lightweight and executable image that includes software and all its dependencies. Containers virtualize the operating system. As a result, you can run containers anywhere from a data center to a public or private cloud as well as a developer’s laptop.
custom resource (CR):: A CR is an extension of the Kubernetes API. You can create custom resources.
etcd:: etcd is the key-value store for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, which stores the state of all resource objects.
Fluentd:: Fluentd is a log collector that resides on each Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform node. It gathers application, infrastructure, and audit logs and forwards them to different outputs.

[NOTE]
----
Fluentd is deprecated and is planned to be removed in a future release. Red Hat provides bug fixes and support for this feature during the current release lifecycle, but this feature no longer receives enhancements. As an alternative to Fluentd, you can use Vector instead.
----
Kubelets:: Runs on nodes and reads the container manifests. Ensures that the defined containers have started and are running.
Kubernetes API server:: Kubernetes API server validates and configures data for the API objects.
Kubernetes controller manager:: Kubernetes controller manager governs the state of the cluster.
Kubernetes scheduler:: Kubernetes scheduler allocates pods to nodes.
labels:: Labels are key-value pairs that you can use to organize and select subsets of objects such as a pod.
Metrics Server:: The Metrics Server monitoring component collects resource metrics and exposes them in the metrics.k8s.io Metrics API service for use by other tools and APIs, which frees the core platform Prometheus stack from handling this functionality.
node:: A compute machine in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. A node is either a virtual machine (VM) or a physical machine.
Operator:: The preferred method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes application in an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. An Operator takes human operational knowledge and encodes it into software that is packaged and shared with customers.
Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM):: OLM helps you install, update, and manage the lifecycle of Kubernetes native applications. OLM is an open source toolkit designed to manage Operators in an effective, automated, and scalable way.
Persistent storage:: Stores the data even after the device is shut down. Kubernetes uses persistent volumes to store the application data.
Persistent volume claim (PVC):: You can use a PVC to mount a PersistentVolume into a Pod. You can access the storage without knowing the details of the cloud environment.
pod:: The pod is the smallest logical unit in Kubernetes. A pod is comprised of one or more containers to run in a worker node.
Prometheus:: Prometheus is the monitoring system on which the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring stack is based. Prometheus is a time-series database and a rule evaluation engine for metrics. Prometheus sends alerts to Alertmanager for processing.
Prometheus Operator:: The Prometheus Operator in the openshift-monitoring project creates, configures, and manages platform Prometheus and Alertmanager instances. It also automatically generates monitoring target configurations based on Kubernetes label queries.
Silences:: A silence can be applied to an alert to prevent notifications from being sent when the conditions for an alert are true. You can mute an alert after the initial notification, while you work on resolving the underlying issue.
storage:: Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform supports many types of storage, both for on-premise and cloud providers.
You can manage container storage for persistent and non-persistent data in an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
Thanos Ruler:: The Thanos Ruler is a rule evaluation engine for Prometheus that is deployed as a separate process. In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, Thanos Ruler provides rule and alerting evaluation for the monitoring of user-defined projects.
Vector:: Vector is a log collector that deploys to each Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform node. It collects log data from each node, transforms the data, and forwards it to configured outputs.
web console:: A user interface (UI) to manage Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
