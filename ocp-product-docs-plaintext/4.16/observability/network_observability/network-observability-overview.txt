# About network observability


Use the Network Observability Operator to observe network traffic via eBPF technology, providing troubleshooting insights through Prometheus metrics and Loki logs.
You can view and analyze this stored information in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform console for further insight and troubleshooting.

# Network Observability Operator

The Network Observability Operator provides the cluster-scoped FlowCollector API custom resource, which manages a pipeline of eBPF agents and services that collect, enrich, and store network flows in Loki or Prometheus.

A FlowCollector instance deploys pods and services that form a monitoring pipeline.

The eBPF agent is deployed as a daemonset object and creates the network flows. The pipeline collects and enriches network flows with Kubernetes metadata before storing them in Loki or generating Prometheus metrics.

# Optional dependencies of the Network Observability Operator

Integrate the Network Observability Operator with optional dependencies, such as the Loki Operator for flow storage and AMQ Streams (Kafka) for resilient, large-scale data handling and scalability.

Supported optional dependencies include the Loki Operator for flow storage, and AMQ Streams for large-scale data handling with Kafka.

Loki Operator:: You can use Loki as the backend to store all collected flows with a maximal level of details. It is recommended to use the Red Hat supported Loki Operator to install Loki. You can also choose to use network observability without Loki, but you need to consider some factors. For more information, see "Network observability without Loki".
AMQ Streams Operator:: Kafka provides scalability, resiliency and high availability in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster for large scale deployments.

[NOTE]
----
If you choose to use Kafka, it is recommended to use Red Hat supported AMQ Streams Operator.

# Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform console integration

The Network Observability Operator integrates with the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform console, providing an overview, topology view, and traffic flow tables.

The Network observability metrics dashboards in Observe &#8594; Dashboards are available only to users with administrator access.


[NOTE]
----
To enable multi-tenancy for developer access and for administrators with limited access to namespaces, you must specify permissions by defining roles. For more information, see "Enabling multi-tenancy in network observability".

## Network observability metrics dashboards

Review the network observability metrics dashboards in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform console, which provide overall traffic flow aggregation, filtering options, and dedicated dashboards for monitoring Operator health.

In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform console on the Overview tab, you can view the overall aggregated metrics of the network traffic flow on the cluster. You can choose to display the information by cluster, node, namespace, owner, pod, and service. Filters and display options can further refine the metrics. For more information, see "Observing the network traffic from the Overview view".

In Observe &#8594; Dashboards, the Netobserv dashboards provide a quick overview of the network flows in your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. The Netobserv/Health dashboard provides metrics about the health of the Operator. For more information, see "Network observability metrics" and "Viewing health information".

## Network observability topology views

The network observability topology view in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform console displays a graphical representation of traffic flow between components, which you can refine using various filters and display options.

The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform console offers the Topology tab which represents traffic between the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform components as a network graph. You can refine the graph by using the filters and display options. You can access the information for cluster, zone, udn, node, namespace, owner, pod, and service.

## Traffic flow tables

The Traffic flow tables in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console provide a detailed view of raw network flows, offering powerful filtering options and configurable columns for in-depth analysis.

The Traffic flows tab in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console displays the data of the network flows and the amount of traffic.

# Network Observability CLI

The Network Observability CLI (oc netobserv) is a lightweight tool that streams flow and packet data for quick, live insight into networking issues without requiring the full Network Observability Operator installation.

The Network Observability CLI is a flow and packet visualization tool that relies on eBPF agents to stream collected data to an ephemeral collector pod. It requires no persistent storage during the capture. After the run, the output is transferred to your local machine. This enables quick, live insight into packets and flow data without installing the Network Observability Operator.
