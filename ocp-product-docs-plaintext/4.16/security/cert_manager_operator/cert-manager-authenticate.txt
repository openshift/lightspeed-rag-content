# Authenticating the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift


To enable the operator to manage components on your cloud provider, authenticate the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift by configuring cloud credentials. You can grant the Operator access to external services required for certificate issuance, such as DNS providers.

# Authenticating on AWS

To securely access AWS resources from your applications, authenticate your workloads on AWS by using the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift.

* You have installed version 1.11.1 or later of the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift.
* You have configured the Cloud Credential Operator to operate in mint or passthrough mode.

1. Create a CredentialsRequest resource YAML file, for example, sample-credential-request.yaml, as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
kind: CredentialsRequest
metadata:
  name: cert-manager
  namespace: openshift-cloud-credential-operator
spec:
  providerSpec:
    apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
    kind: AWSProviderSpec
    statementEntries:
    - action:
      - "route53:GetChange"
      effect: Allow
      resource: "arn:aws:route53:::change/*"
    - action:
      - "route53:ChangeResourceRecordSets"
      - "route53:ListResourceRecordSets"
      effect: Allow
      resource: "arn:aws:route53:::hostedzone/*"
    - action:
      - "route53:ListHostedZonesByName"
      effect: Allow
      resource: "*"
  secretRef:
    name: aws-creds
    namespace: cert-manager
  serviceAccountNames:
  - cert-manager
```

2. Create a CredentialsRequest resource by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f sample-credential-request.yaml
```

3. Update the subscription object for cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n cert-manager-operator patch subscription openshift-cert-manager-operator --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"config":{"env":[{"name":"CLOUD_CREDENTIALS_SECRET_NAME","value":"aws-creds"}]}}}'
```


1. Get the name of the redeployed cert-manager controller pod by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=cert-manager -n cert-manager
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cert-manager-bd7fbb9fc-wvbbt  1/1     Running   0          15m39s
```

2. Verify that the cert-manager controller pod is updated with AWS credential volumes that are mounted under the path specified in mountPath by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get -n cert-manager pod/<cert-manager_controller_pod_name> -o yaml
```

Example output

```terminal
...
spec:
  containers:
  - args:
    ...
    - mountPath: /.aws
      name: cloud-credentials
  ...
  volumes:
  ...
  - name: cloud-credentials
    secret:
      ...
      secretName: aws-creds
```


# Authenticating with AWS Security Token Service

To securely access AWS resources from your applications without managing long-lived keys, authenticate your workloads by using the AWS Security Token Service (STS).

* You have extracted and prepared the ccoctl binary.
* You have configured an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster with AWS STS by using the Cloud Credential Operator in manual mode.

1. Create a directory to store a CredentialsRequest resource YAML file by running the following command:

```terminal
$ mkdir credentials-request
```

2. Create a CredentialsRequest resource YAML file under the credentials-request directory, such as, sample-credential-request.yaml, by applying the following yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
kind: CredentialsRequest
metadata:
  name: cert-manager
  namespace: openshift-cloud-credential-operator
spec:
  providerSpec:
    apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
    kind: AWSProviderSpec
    statementEntries:
    - action:
      - "route53:GetChange"
      effect: Allow
      resource: "arn:aws:route53:::change/*"
    - action:
      - "route53:ChangeResourceRecordSets"
      - "route53:ListResourceRecordSets"
      effect: Allow
      resource: "arn:aws:route53:::hostedzone/*"
    - action:
      - "route53:ListHostedZonesByName"
      effect: Allow
      resource: "*"
  secretRef:
    name: aws-creds
    namespace: cert-manager
  serviceAccountNames:
  - cert-manager
```

3. Use the ccoctl tool to process CredentialsRequest objects by running the following command:

```terminal
$ ccoctl aws create-iam-roles \
    --name <user_defined_name> --region=<aws_region> \
    --credentials-requests-dir=<path_to_credrequests_dir> \
    --identity-provider-arn <oidc_provider_arn> --output-dir=<path_to_output_dir>
```

Example output

```terminal
2023/05/15 18:10:34 Role arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXXXXXX:role/<user_defined_name>-cert-manager-aws-creds created
2023/05/15 18:10:34 Saved credentials configuration to: <path_to_output_dir>/manifests/cert-manager-aws-creds-credentials.yaml
2023/05/15 18:10:35 Updated Role policy for Role <user_defined_name>-cert-manager-aws-creds
```


Copy the <aws_role_arn> from the output to use in the next step. For example, "arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXXXXXX:role/<user_defined_name>-cert-manager-aws-creds"
4. Add the eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn="<aws_role_arn>" annotation to the service account by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n cert-manager annotate serviceaccount cert-manager eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn="<aws_role_arn>"
```

5. To create a new pod, delete the existing cert-manager controller pod by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=cert-manager -n cert-manager
```


The AWS credentials are applied to a new cert-manager controller pod within a minute.

1. Get the name of the updated cert-manager controller pod by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=cert-manager -n cert-manager
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cert-manager-bd7fbb9fc-wvbbt  1/1     Running   0          39s
```

2. Verify that AWS credentials are updated by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc set env -n cert-manager po/<cert_manager_controller_pod_name> --list
```

Example output

```terminal
# pods/cert-manager-57f9555c54-vbcpg, container cert-manager-controller
# POD_NAMESPACE from field path metadata.namespace
AWS_ROLE_ARN=XXXXXXXXXXXX
AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE=/var/run/secrets/eks.amazonaws.com/serviceaccount/token
```
