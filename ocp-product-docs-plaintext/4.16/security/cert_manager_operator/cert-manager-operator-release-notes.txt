## New features and enhancements

FIPS compliance support

With this release, FIPS mode is now automatically enabled for cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift. When installed on an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster in FIPS mode, cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift ensures compatibility without affecting the cluster&#8217;s FIPS support status.

Securing routes with cert-manager managed certificates (Technology Preview)

With this release, you can manage certificates referenced in Route resources by using the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift. For more information, see Securing routes with the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift.

NCM issuer

The cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift now supports the Nokia NetGuard Certificate Manager (NCM) issuer. The ncm-issuer is a cert-manager external issuer that integrates with the NCM PKI system using a Kubernetes controller to sign certificate requests. This integration streamlines the process of obtaining non-self-signed certificates for applications, ensuring their validity and keeping them updated.


[NOTE]
----
The NCM issuer is validated only with version 1.1.1 and the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift version 1.14.0. This version handles tasks such as issuance, renewal, and managing certificates for the API server and ingress controller of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters.
