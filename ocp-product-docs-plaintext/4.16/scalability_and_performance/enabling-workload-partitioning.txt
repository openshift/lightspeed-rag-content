# Workload partitioning


Workload partitioning separates compute node CPU resources into distinct CPU sets. The primary objective is to keep platform pods on the specified cores to avoid interrupting the CPUs the customer workloads are running on.
Workload partitioning isolates Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform services, cluster management workloads, and infrastructure pods to run on a reserved set of CPUs. This ensures that the remaining CPUs in the cluster deployment are untouched and available exclusively for non-platform workloads. The minimum number of reserved CPUs required for the cluster management is four CPU Hyper-Threads (HTs).
In the context of enabling workload partitioning and managing CPU resources effectively, nodes that are not configured correctly will not be permitted to join the cluster through a node admission webhook. When the workload partitioning feature is enabled, the machine config pools for control plane and worker will be supplied with configurations for nodes to use. Adding new nodes to these pools will make sure they are correctly configured before joining the cluster.
Currently, nodes must have uniform configurations per machine config pool to ensure that correct CPU affinity is set across all nodes within that pool. After admission, nodes within the cluster identify themselves as supporting a new resource type called management.workload.openshift.io/cores and accurately report their CPU capacity. Workload partitioning can be enabled during cluster installation only by adding the additional field cpuPartitioningMode to the install-config.yaml file.
When workload partitioning is enabled, the management.workload.openshift.io/cores resource allows the scheduler to correctly assign pods based on the cpushares capacity of the host, not just the default cpuset. This ensures more precise allocation of resources for workload partitioning scenarios.
Workload partitioning ensures that CPU requests and limits specified in the pod's configuration are respected. In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 or later, accurate CPU usage limits are set for platform pods through CPU partitioning. As workload partitioning uses the custom resource type of management.workload.openshift.io/cores, the values for requests and limits are the same due to a requirement by Kubernetes for extended resources. However, the annotations modified by workload partitioning correctly reflect the desired limits.

[NOTE]
----
Extended resources cannot be overcommitted, so request and limit must be equal if both are present in a container spec.

# Enabling workload partitioning

With workload partitioning, cluster management pods are annotated to correctly partition them into a specified CPU affinity. These pods operate normally within the minimum size CPU configuration specified by the reserved value in the Performance Profile. Additional Day 2 Operators that make use of workload partitioning should be taken into account when calculating how many reserved CPU cores should be set aside for the platform.

Workload partitioning isolates user workloads from platform workloads using standard Kubernetes scheduling capabilities.


[NOTE]
----
Workload partitioning can only be enabled during cluster installation. You cannot disable workload partitioning postinstallation.

Use this procedure to enable workload partitioning cluster wide:

* In the install-config.yaml file, add the additional field cpuPartitioningMode and set it to AllNodes.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: devcluster.openshift.com
cpuPartitioningMode: AllNodes 1
compute:
  - architecture: amd64
    hyperthreading: Enabled
    name: worker
    platform: {}
    replicas: 3
controlPlane:
  architecture: amd64
  hyperthreading: Enabled
  name: master
  platform: {}
  replicas: 3
```

Sets up a cluster for CPU partitioning at install time. The default value is None.

# Performance profiles and workload partitioning

Applying a performance profile allows you to make use of the workload partitioning feature. An appropriately configured performance profile specifies the isolated and reserved CPUs. The recommended way to create a performance profile is to use the Performance Profile Creator (PPC) tool to create the performance profile.

# Sample performance profile configuration


```yaml
apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2
kind: PerformanceProfile
metadata:
  # if you change this name make sure the 'include' line in TunedPerformancePatch.yaml
  # matches this name: include=openshift-node-performance-${PerformanceProfile.metadata.name}
  # Also in file 'validatorCRs/informDuValidator.yaml': 
  # name: 50-performance-${PerformanceProfile.metadata.name}
