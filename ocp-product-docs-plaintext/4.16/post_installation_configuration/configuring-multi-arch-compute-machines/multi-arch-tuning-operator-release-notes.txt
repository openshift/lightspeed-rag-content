# Release notes for the Multiarch Tuning Operator 1.1.0

Issued: 18 March 2024

## New features and enhancements

* The Multiarch Tuning Operator is now supported on managed offerings, including ROSA with Hosted Control Planes (HCP) and other HCP environments.
* With this release, you can configure architecture-aware workload scheduling by using the new plugins field in the ClusterPodPlacementConfig object. You can use the plugins.nodeAffinityScoring field to set architecture preferences for pod placement. If you enable the nodeAffinityScoring plugin, the scheduler first filters out nodes that do not meet the pod requirements. Then, the scheduler prioritizes the remaining nodes based on the architecture scores defined in the nodeAffinityScoring.platforms field.

### Bug fixes

* With this release, the Multiarch Tuning Operator does not update the nodeAffinity field for pods that are managed by a daemon set. (OCPBUGS-45885)

# Release notes for the Multiarch Tuning Operator 1.0.0

Issued: 31 October 2024

## New features and enhancements

* With this release, you can identify pods based on their architecture compatibility by using the pod labels that the Multiarch Tuning Operator adds to newly created pods.
* With this release, you can monitor the behavior of the Multiarch Tuning Operator by using the metrics and alerts that are registered in the Cluster Monitoring Operator.
