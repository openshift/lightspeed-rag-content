# Managing a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines



# Scheduling workloads on clusters with multi-architecture compute machines

Deploying a workload on a cluster with compute nodes of different architectures requires attention and monitoring of your cluster. There might be further actions you need to take in order to successfully place pods in the nodes of your cluster.

You can use the Multiarch Tuning Operator to enable architecture-aware scheduling of workloads on clusters with multi-architecture compute machines. The Multiarch Tuning Operator implements additional scheduler predicates in the pods specifications based on the architectures that the pods can support at creation time. For more information, see Managing workloads on multi-architecture clusters by using the Multiarch Tuning Operator.

For more information on node affinity, scheduling, taints and tolerations, see the following documentation:

* Controlling pod placement on nodes using node affinity
* Controlling pod placement using the scheduler

## Sample multi-architecture node workload deployments

Before you schedule workloads on a cluster with compute nodes of different architectures, consider the following use cases:

Using node affinity to schedule workloads on a node:: You can allow a workload to be scheduled on only a set of nodes with architectures supported by its images, you can set the spec.affinity.nodeAffinity field in your pod's template specification.
Example deployment with the nodeAffinity set to certain architectures

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata: # ...
spec:
   # ...
  template:
     # ...
    spec:
      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
            nodeSelectorTerms:
            - matchExpressions:
              - key: kubernetes.io/arch
                operator: In
                values: 1
                - amd64
                - arm64
```

Specify the supported architectures. Valid values include amd64,arm64, or both values.
Tainting every node for a specific architecture:: You can taint a node to avoid workloads that are not compatible with its architecture to be scheduled on that node. In the case where your cluster is using a MachineSet object, you can add parameters to the .spec.template.spec.taints field to avoid workloads being scheduled on nodes with non-supported architectures.
* Before you can taint a node, you must scale down the MachineSet object or remove available machines. You can scale down the machine set by using one of following commands:

```terminal
$ oc scale --replicas=0 machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
```


Or:

```terminal
$ oc edit machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
```


For more information on scaling machine sets, see "Modifying a compute machine set".

```yaml
apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: MachineSet
metadata: # ...
spec:
  # ...
  template:
    # ...
    spec:
      # ...
      taints:
      - effect: NoSchedule
        key: multi-arch.openshift.io/arch
        value: arm64
```

You can also set a taint on a specific node by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc adm taint nodes <node-name> multi-arch.openshift.io/arch=arm64:NoSchedule
```
Creating a default toleration:: You can annotate a namespace so all of the workloads get the same default toleration by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc annotate namespace my-namespace \
  'scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/defaultTolerations'='[{"operator": "Exists", "effect": "NoSchedule", "key": "multi-arch.openshift.io/arch"}]'
```

Tolerating architecture taints in workloads:: On a node with a defined taint, workloads will not be scheduled on that node. However, you can allow them to be scheduled by setting a toleration in the pod's specification.
Example deployment with a toleration

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata: # ...
spec:
  # ...
  template:
    # ...
    spec:
      tolerations:
      - key: "multi-arch.openshift.io/arch"
        value: "arm64"
        operator: "Equal"
        effect: "NoSchedule"
```


This example deployment can also be allowed on nodes with the multi-arch.openshift.io/arch=arm64 taint specified.
Using node affinity with taints and tolerations:: When a scheduler computes the set of nodes to schedule a pod, tolerations can broaden the set while node affinity restricts the set. If you set a taint to the nodes of a specific architecture, the following example toleration is required for scheduling pods.
Example deployment with a node affinity and toleration set.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata: # ...
spec:
  # ...
  template:
    # ...
    spec:
      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
            nodeSelectorTerms:
            - matchExpressions:
              - key: kubernetes.io/arch
                operator: In
                values:
                - amd64
                - arm64
      tolerations:
      - key: "multi-arch.openshift.io/arch"
        value: "arm64"
        operator: "Equal"
        effect: "NoSchedule"
```


* Modifying a compute machine set

# Enabling 64k pages on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) kernel

You can enable the 64k memory page in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) kernel on the 64-bit ARM compute machines in your cluster. The 64k page size kernel specification can be used for large GPU or high memory workloads. This is done using the Machine Config Operator (MCO) which uses a machine config pool to update the kernel. To enable 64k page sizes, you must dedicate a machine config pool for ARM64 to enable on the kernel.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Using 64k pages is exclusive to 64-bit ARM architecture compute nodes or clusters installed on 64-bit ARM machines. If you configure the 64k pages kernel on a machine config pool using 64-bit x86 machines, the machine config pool and MCO will degrade.
----

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You created a cluster with compute nodes of different architecture on one of the supported platforms.

1. Label the nodes where you want to run the 64k page size kernel:

```terminal
$ oc label node <node_name> <label>
```

Example command

```terminal
$ oc label node worker-arm64-01 node-role.kubernetes.io/worker-64k-pages=
```

2. Create a machine config pool that contains the worker role that uses the ARM64 architecture and the worker-64k-pages role:

```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfigPool
metadata:
  name: worker-64k-pages
spec:
  machineConfigSelector:
    matchExpressions:
      - key: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role
        operator: In
        values:
        - worker
        - worker-64k-pages
  nodeSelector:
    matchLabels:
      node-role.kubernetes.io/worker-64k-pages: ""
      kubernetes.io/arch: arm64
```

3. Create a machine config on your compute node to enable 64k-pages with the 64k-pages parameter.

```terminal
$ oc create -f <filename>.yaml
```

Example MachineConfig

```yaml
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: "worker-64k-pages" 1
  name: 99-worker-64kpages
spec:
  kernelType: 64k-pages 2
```

Specify the value of the machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role label in the custom machine config pool. The example MachineConfig uses the worker-64k-pages label to enable 64k pages in the worker-64k-pages pool.
Specify your desired kernel type. Valid values are 64k-pages and default

[NOTE]
----
The 64k-pages type is supported on only 64-bit ARM architecture based compute nodes. The realtime type is supported on only 64-bit x86 architecture based compute nodes.
----

* To view your new worker-64k-pages machine config pool, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get mcp
```

# Importing manifest lists in image streams on your multi-architecture compute machines

On an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 cluster with multi-architecture compute machines, the image streams in the cluster do not import manifest lists automatically. You must manually change the default importMode option to the PreserveOriginal option in order to import the manifest list.

* You installed the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI (oc).

* The following example command shows how to patch the ImageStream cli-artifacts so that the cli-artifacts:latest image stream tag is imported as a manifest list.

```terminal
$ oc patch is/cli-artifacts -n openshift -p '{"spec":{"tags":[{"name":"latest","importPolicy":{"importMode":"PreserveOriginal"}}]}}'
```


* You can check that the manifest lists imported properly by inspecting the image stream tag. The following command will list the individual architecture manifests for a particular tag.

```terminal
$ oc get istag cli-artifacts:latest -n openshift -oyaml
```


If the dockerImageManifests object is present, then the manifest list import was successful.
