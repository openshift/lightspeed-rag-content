# Extending the OpenShift CLI with plugins


You can write and install plugins to build on the default oc commands,
allowing you to perform new and more complex tasks with the
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
CLI.

# Writing CLI plugins

You can write a plugin for the
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
CLI in any programming language
or script that allows you to write command-line commands. Note that you can not
use a plugin to overwrite an existing oc command.

This procedure creates a simple Bash plugin that prints a message to the
terminal when the oc foo command is issued.

1. Create a file called oc-foo.

When naming your plugin file, keep the following in mind:
* The file must begin with oc- or kubectl- to be recognized as a
plugin.
* The file name determines the command that invokes the plugin. For example, a
plugin with the file name oc-foo-bar can be invoked by a command of
oc foo bar. You can also use underscores if you want the command to contain
dashes. For example, a plugin with the file name oc-foo_bar can be invoked
by a command of oc foo-bar.
2. Add the following contents to the file.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# optional argument handling
if [[ "$1" == "version" ]]
then
    echo "1.0.0"
    exit 0
fi

# optional argument handling
if [[ "$1" == "config" ]]
then
    echo $KUBECONFIG
    exit 0
fi

echo "I am a plugin named kubectl-foo"
```


After you install this plugin for the
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
CLI, it can be invoked
using the oc foo command.

* Review the Sample plugin repository
for an example of a plugin written in Go.
* Review the CLI runtime repository for a set of utilities to assist in writing plugins in Go.

# Installing and using CLI plugins

After you write a custom plugin for the
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
CLI, you must install
the plugin before use.

* You must have the oc CLI tool installed.
* You must have a CLI plugin file that begins with oc- or kubectl-.

1. If necessary, update the plugin file to be executable.

```terminal
$ chmod +x <plugin_file>
```

2. Place the file anywhere in your PATH, such as /usr/local/bin/.

```terminal
$ sudo mv <plugin_file> /usr/local/bin/.
```

3. Run oc plugin list to make sure that the plugin is listed.

```terminal
$ oc plugin list
```

Example output

```terminal
The following compatible plugins are available:

/usr/local/bin/<plugin_file>
```


If your plugin is not listed here, verify that the file begins with oc-
or kubectl-, is executable, and is on your PATH.
4. Invoke the new command or option introduced by the plugin.

For example, if you built and installed the kubectl-ns plugin from the
 Sample plugin repository,
  you can use the following command to view the current namespace.

```terminal
$ oc ns
```


Note that the command to invoke the plugin depends on the plugin file name.
For example, a plugin with the file name of oc-foo-bar is invoked by the oc foo bar
command.
