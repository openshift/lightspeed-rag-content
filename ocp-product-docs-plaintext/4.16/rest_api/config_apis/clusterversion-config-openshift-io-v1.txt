# ClusterVersion [config.openshift.io/v1]


Description:: 
ClusterVersion is the configuration for the ClusterVersionOperator. This is where parameters related to automatic updates can be set.
 Compatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).
Type:: object
Required:: 
* spec

# Specification



## .spec

Description:: 
spec is the desired state of the cluster version - the operator will work to ensure that the desired version is applied to the cluster.
Type:: object
Required:: 
* clusterID



## .spec.capabilities

Description:: 
capabilities configures the installation of optional, core cluster components.  A null value here is identical to an empty object; see the child properties for default semantics.
Type:: object



## .spec.desiredUpdate

Description:: 
desiredUpdate is an optional field that indicates the desired value of the cluster version. Setting this value will trigger an upgrade (if the current version does not match the desired version). The set of recommended update values is listed as part of available updates in status, and setting values outside that range may cause the upgrade to fail.
 Some of the fields are inter-related with restrictions and meanings described here. 1. image is specified, version is specified, architecture is specified. API validation error. 2. image is specified, version is specified, architecture is not specified. You should not do this. version is silently ignored and image is used. 3. image is specified, version is not specified, architecture is specified. API validation error. 4. image is specified, version is not specified, architecture is not specified. image is used. 5. image is not specified, version is specified, architecture is specified. version and desired architecture are used to select an image. 6. image is not specified, version is specified, architecture is not specified. version and current architecture are used to select an image. 7. image is not specified, version is not specified, architecture is specified. API validation error. 8. image is not specified, version is not specified, architecture is not specified. API validation error.
 If an upgrade fails the operator will halt and report status about the failing component. Setting the desired update value back to the previous version will cause a rollback to be attempted. Not all rollbacks will succeed.
Type:: object



## .spec.overrides

Description:: 
overrides is list of overides for components that are managed by cluster version operator. Marking a component unmanaged will prevent the operator from creating or updating the object.
Type:: array

## .spec.overrides[]

Description:: 
ComponentOverride allows overriding cluster version operator's behavior for a component.
Type:: object
Required:: 
* group
* kind
* name
* namespace
* unmanaged



## .status

Description:: 
status contains information about the available updates and any in-progress updates.
Type:: object
Required:: 
* desired
* observedGeneration
* versionHash



## .status.capabilities

Description:: 
capabilities describes the state of optional, core cluster components.
Type:: object



## .status.conditionalUpdates

Description:: 
conditionalUpdates contains the list of updates that may be recommended for this cluster if it meets specific required conditions. Consumers interested in the set of updates that are actually recommended for this cluster should use availableUpdates. This list may be empty if no updates are recommended, if the update service is unavailable, or if an empty or invalid channel has been specified.
Type:: array

## .status.conditionalUpdates[]

Description:: 
ConditionalUpdate represents an update which is recommended to some clusters on the version the current cluster is reconciling, but which may not be recommended for the current cluster.
Type:: object
Required:: 
* release
* risks



## .status.conditionalUpdates[].conditions

Description:: 
conditions represents the observations of the conditional update's current status. Known types are: * Recommended, for whether the update is recommended for the current cluster.
Type:: array

## .status.conditionalUpdates[].conditions[]

Description:: 
Condition contains details for one aspect of the current state of this API Resource. --- This struct is intended for direct use as an array at the field path .status.conditions.  For example,
 type FooStatus struct{ // Represents the observations of a foo's current state. // Known .status.conditions.type are: "Available", "Progressing", and "Degraded" // +patchMergeKey=type // +patchStrategy=merge // +listType=map // +listMapKey=type Conditions []metav1.Condition json:"conditions,omitempty" patchStrategy:"merge" patchMergeKey:"type" protobuf:"bytes,1,rep,name=conditions"
 // other fields }
Type:: object
Required:: 
* lastTransitionTime
* message
* reason
* status
* type



## .status.conditionalUpdates[].release

Description:: 
release is the target of the update.
Type:: object



## .status.conditionalUpdates[].risks

Description:: 
risks represents the range of issues associated with updating to the target release. The cluster-version operator will evaluate all entries, and only recommend the update if there is at least one entry and all entries recommend the update.
Type:: array

## .status.conditionalUpdates[].risks[]

Description:: 
ConditionalUpdateRisk represents a reason and cluster-state for not recommending a conditional update.
Type:: object
Required:: 
* matchingRules
* message
* name
* url



## .status.conditionalUpdates[].risks[].matchingRules

Description:: 
matchingRules is a slice of conditions for deciding which clusters match the risk and which do not. The slice is ordered by decreasing precedence. The cluster-version operator will walk the slice in order, and stop after the first it can successfully evaluate. If no condition can be successfully evaluated, the update will not be recommended.
Type:: array

## .status.conditionalUpdates[].risks[].matchingRules[]

Description:: 
ClusterCondition is a union of typed cluster conditions.  The 'type' property determines which of the type-specific properties are relevant. When evaluated on a cluster, the condition may match, not match, or fail to evaluate.
Type:: object
Required:: 
* type



## .status.conditionalUpdates[].risks[].matchingRules[].promql

Description:: 
promQL represents a cluster condition based on PromQL.
Type:: object
Required:: 
* promql



## .status.conditions

Description:: 
conditions provides information about the cluster version. The condition "Available" is set to true if the desiredUpdate has been reached. The condition "Progressing" is set to true if an update is being applied. The condition "Degraded" is set to true if an update is currently blocked by a temporary or permanent error. Conditions are only valid for the current desiredUpdate when metadata.generation is equal to status.generation.
Type:: array

## .status.conditions[]

Description:: 
ClusterOperatorStatusCondition represents the state of the operator's managed and monitored components.
Type:: object
Required:: 
* lastTransitionTime
* status
* type



## .status.desired

Description:: 
desired is the version that the cluster is reconciling towards. If the cluster is not yet fully initialized desired will be set with the information available, which may be an image or a tag.
Type:: object



## .status.history

Description:: 
history contains a list of the most recent versions applied to the cluster. This value may be empty during cluster startup, and then will be updated when a new update is being applied. The newest update is first in the list and it is ordered by recency. Updates in the history have state Completed if the rollout completed - if an update was failing or halfway applied the state will be Partial. Only a limited amount of update history is preserved.
Type:: array

## .status.history[]

Description:: 
UpdateHistory is a single attempted update to the cluster.
Type:: object
Required:: 
* image
* startedTime
* state
* verified
