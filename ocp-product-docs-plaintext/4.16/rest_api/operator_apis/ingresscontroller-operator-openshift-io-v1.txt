# IngressController [operator.openshift.io/v1]


Description:: 
IngressController describes a managed ingress controller for the cluster. The controller can service OpenShift Route and Kubernetes Ingress resources.
 When an IngressController is created, a new ingress controller deployment is created to allow external traffic to reach the services that expose Ingress or Route resources. Updating this resource may lead to disruption for public facing network connections as a new ingress controller revision may be rolled out.
 https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers
 Whenever possible, sensible defaults for the platform are used. See each field for more details.
 Compatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).

# Specification



## .spec

Description:: 
spec is the specification of the desired behavior of the IngressController.
Type:: object



## .spec.clientTLS

Description:: 
clientTLS specifies settings for requesting and verifying client certificates, which can be used to enable mutual TLS for edge-terminated and reencrypt routes.
Type:: object
Required:: 
* clientCA
* clientCertificatePolicy



## .spec.clientTLS.clientCA

Description:: 
clientCA specifies a configmap containing the PEM-encoded CA certificate bundle that should be used to verify a client's certificate.  The administrator must create this configmap in the openshift-config namespace.
Type:: object
Required:: 
* name



## .spec.defaultCertificate

Description:: 
defaultCertificate is a reference to a secret containing the default certificate served by the ingress controller. When Routes don't specify their own certificate, defaultCertificate is used.
 The secret must contain the following keys and data:
 tls.crt: certificate file contents tls.key: key file contents
 If unset, a wildcard certificate is automatically generated and used. The certificate is valid for the ingress controller domain (and subdomains) and the generated certificate's CA will be automatically integrated with the cluster's trust store.
 If a wildcard certificate is used and shared by multiple HTTP/2 enabled routes (which implies ALPN) then clients (i.e., notably browsers) are at liberty to reuse open connections. This means a client can reuse a connection to another route and that is likely to fail. This behaviour is generally known as connection coalescing.
 The in-use certificate (whether generated or user-specified) will be automatically integrated with OpenShift's built-in OAuth server.
Type:: object



## .spec.endpointPublishingStrategy

Description:: 
endpointPublishingStrategy is used to publish the ingress controller endpoints to other networks, enable load balancer integrations, etc.

 Any other platform types (including None) default to HostNetwork.
 endpointPublishingStrategy cannot be updated.

## .spec.httpErrorCodePages

Description:: 
httpErrorCodePages specifies a configmap with custom error pages. The administrator must create this configmap in the openshift-config namespace. This configmap should have keys in the format "error-page-<error code>.http", where <error code> is an HTTP error code. For example, "error-page-503.http" defines an error page for HTTP 503 responses. Currently only error pages for 503 and 404 responses can be customized. Each value in the configmap should be the full response, including HTTP headers. Eg- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/router/fadab45747a9b30cc3f0a4b41ad2871f95827a93/images/router/haproxy/conf/error-page-503.http If this field is empty, the ingress controller uses the default error pages.

Description::

 If this field is empty, the default values are used.

## .spec.httpHeaders.actions

Description:: 
actions specifies options for modifying headers and their values. Note that this option only applies to cleartext HTTP connections and to secure HTTP connections for which the ingress controller terminates encryption (that is, edge-terminated or reencrypt connections).  Headers cannot be modified for TLS passthrough connections. Setting the HSTS (Strict-Transport-Security) header is not supported via actions. Strict-Transport-Security may only be configured using the "haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header" route annotation, and only in accordance with the policy specified in Ingress.Spec.RequiredHSTSPolicies. Any actions defined here are applied after any actions related to the following other fields: cache-control, spec.clientTLS, spec.httpHeaders.forwardedHeaderPolicy, spec.httpHeaders.uniqueId, and spec.httpHeaders.headerNameCaseAdjustments. In case of HTTP request headers, the actions specified in spec.httpHeaders.actions on the Route will be executed after the actions specified in the IngressController's spec.httpHeaders.actions field. In case of HTTP response headers, the actions specified in spec.httpHeaders.actions on the IngressController will be executed after the actions specified in the Route's spec.httpHeaders.actions field. Headers set using this API cannot be captured for use in access logs. The following header names are reserved and may not be modified via this API: Strict-Transport-Security, Proxy, Host, Cookie, Set-Cookie. Note that the total size of all net added headers after interpolating dynamic values must not exceed the value of spec.tuningOptions.headerBufferMaxRewriteBytes on the IngressController. Please refer to the documentation for that API field for more details.
Type:: object



## .spec.httpHeaders.actions.request

Description:: 
request is a list of HTTP request headers to modify. Actions defined here will modify the request headers of all requests passing through an ingress controller. These actions are applied to all Routes i.e. for all connections handled by the ingress controller defined within a cluster. IngressController actions for request headers will be executed before Route actions. Currently, actions may define to either Set or Delete headers values. Actions are applied in sequence as defined in this list. A maximum of 20 request header actions may be configured. Sample fetchers allowed are "req.hdr" and "ssl_c_der". Converters allowed are "lower" and "base64". Example header values: "%[req.hdr(X-target),lower]", "%{+Q}[ssl_c_der,base64]".

Actions are applied in sequence as defined in this list. A maximum of 20 response header actions may be configured. Sample fetchers allowed are "res.hdr" and "ssl_c_der". Converters allowed are "lower" and "base64". Example header values: "%[res.hdr(X-target),lower]", "%{+Q}[ssl_c_der,base64]".

Type:: object



## .spec.nodePlacement.nodeSelector

Description:: 
nodeSelector is the node selector applied to ingress controller deployments.
 If set, the specified selector is used and replaces the default.
 If unset, the default depends on the value of the defaultPlacement field in the cluster config.openshift.io/v1/ingresses status.
 When defaultPlacement is Workers, the default is:

 Note that when using the Old, Intermediate, and Modern profile types, the effective profile configuration is subject to change between releases. For example, given a specification to use the Intermediate profile deployed on release X.Y.Z, an upgrade to release X.Y.Z+1 may cause a new profile configuration to be applied to the ingress controller, resulting in a rollout.
