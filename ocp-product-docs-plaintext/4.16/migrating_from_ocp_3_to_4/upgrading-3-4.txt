# Upgrading the Migration Toolkit for Containers


You can upgrade the Migration Toolkit for Containers (MTC) on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 by using Operator Lifecycle Manager.
You can upgrade MTC on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3 by reinstalling the legacy Migration Toolkit for Containers Operator.

[IMPORTANT]
----
If you are upgrading from MTC version 1.3, you must perform an additional procedure to update the MigPlan custom resource (CR).

# Upgrading the Migration Toolkit for Containers on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16

You can upgrade the Migration Toolkit for Containers (MTC) on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 by using the Operator Lifecycle Manager.


[IMPORTANT]
----
When upgrading the MTC by using the Operator Lifecycle Manager, you must use a supported migration path.
----

* Migrating from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3 to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 requires a legacy MTC Operator and MTC 1.7.x.
* Migrating from MTC 1.7.x to MTC 1.8.x is not supported.
* You must use MTC 1.7.x to migrate anything with a source of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.9 or earlier.
* MTC 1.7.x must be used on both source and destination.
* MTC 1.8.x only supports migrations from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 or later to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 or later. For migrations only involving cluster versions 4.10 and later, either 1.7.x or 1.8.x may be used. However, it must be the same MTC version on both source & destination.
* Migration from source MTC 1.7.x to destination MTC 1.8.x is unsupported.
* Migration from source MTC 1.8.x to destination MTC 1.7.x is unsupported.
* Migration from source MTC 1.7.x to destination MTC 1.7.x is supported.
* Migration from source MTC 1.8.x to destination MTC 1.8.x is supported

* You must be logged in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

1. In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform console, navigate to Operators -> Installed Operators.

Operators that have a pending upgrade display an Upgrade available status.
2. Click Migration Toolkit for Containers Operator.
3. Click the Subscription tab. Any upgrades requiring approval are displayed next to Upgrade Status. For example, it might display 1 requires approval.
4. Click 1 requires approval, then click Preview Install Plan.
5. Review the resources that are listed as available for upgrade and click Approve.
6. Navigate back to the Operators -> Installed Operators page to monitor the progress of the upgrade. When complete, the status changes to Succeeded and Up to date.
7. Click Workloads -> Pods to verify that the MTC pods are running.

# Upgrading the Migration Toolkit for Containers on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3

You can upgrade Migration Toolkit for Containers (MTC) on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3 by manually installing the legacy Migration Toolkit for Containers Operator.

* You must be logged in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* You must have access to registry.redhat.io.
* You must have podman installed.

1. Log in to registry.redhat.io with your Red Hat Customer Portal credentials by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ podman login registry.redhat.io
```

2. Download the operator.yml file by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ podman cp $(podman create registry.redhat.io/rhmtc/openshift-migration-legacy-rhel8-operator:v1.7:/operator.yml ./
```

3. Replace the Migration Toolkit for Containers Operator by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc replace --force -f operator.yml
```

4. Scale the migration-operator deployment to 0 to stop the deployment by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc scale -n openshift-migration --replicas=0 deployment/migration-operator
```

5. Scale the migration-operator deployment to 1 to start the deployment and apply the changes by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc scale -n openshift-migration --replicas=1 deployment/migration-operator
```

6. Verify that the migration-operator was upgraded by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -o yaml -n openshift-migration get deployment/migration-operator | grep image: | awk -F ":" '{ print $NF }'
```

7. Download the controller.yml file by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ podman cp $(podman create registry.redhat.io/rhmtc/openshift-migration-legacy-rhel8-operator:v1.7):/operator.yml ./
```

8. Create the migration-controller object by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f controller.yml
```

9. If you have previously added the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3 cluster to the MTC web console, you must update the service account token in the web console because the upgrade process deletes and restores the openshift-migration namespace:
1. Obtain the service account token by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc sa get-token migration-controller -n openshift-migration
```

2. In the MTC web console, click Clusters.
3. Click the Options menu . next to the cluster and select Edit.
4. Enter the new service account token in the Service account token field.
5. Click Update cluster and then click Close.
10. Verify that the MTC pods are running by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get pods -n openshift-migration
```


# Upgrading MTC 1.3 to 1.8

If you are upgrading Migration Toolkit for Containers (MTC) version 1.3.x to 1.8, you must update the MigPlan custom resource (CR) manifest on the cluster on which the MigrationController pod is running.

Because the indirectImageMigration and indirectVolumeMigration parameters do not exist in MTC 1.3, their default value in version 1.4 is false, which means that direct image migration and direct volume migration are enabled. Because the direct migration requirements are not fulfilled, the migration plan cannot reach a Ready state unless these parameter values are changed to true.


[IMPORTANT]
----
* Migrating from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3 to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 requires a legacy MTC Operator and MTC 1.7.x.
* Upgrading MTC 1.7.x to 1.8.x requires manually updating the OADP channel from stable-1.0 to stable-1.2 in order to successfully complete the upgrade from 1.7.x to 1.8.x.
----

* You must be logged in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

1. Log in to the cluster on which the MigrationController pod is running.
2. Get the MigPlan CR manifest:

```terminal
$ oc get migplan <migplan> -o yaml -n openshift-migration
```

3. Update the following parameter values and save the file as migplan.yaml:

```yaml
...
spec:
  indirectImageMigration: true
  indirectVolumeMigration: true
```

4. Replace the MigPlan CR manifest to apply the changes:

```terminal
$ oc replace -f migplan.yaml -n openshift-migration
```

5. Get the updated MigPlan CR manifest to verify the changes:

```terminal
$ oc get migplan <migplan> -o yaml -n openshift-migration
```
