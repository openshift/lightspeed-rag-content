# Getting support



Windows Container Support for Red&#160;Hat OpenShift is provided and available as an optional, installable component. Windows Container Support for Red&#160;Hat OpenShift is not part of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform subscription. It requires an additional Red&#160;Hat subscription and is supported according to the Scope of coverage and Service level agreements.

You must have this separate subscription to receive support for Windows Container Support for Red&#160;Hat OpenShift. Without this additional Red&#160;Hat subscription, deploying Windows container workloads in production clusters is not supported. You can request support through the Red Hat Customer Portal.

For more information, see the Red&#160;Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy document for Red Hat OpenShift support for Windows Containers.

If you do not have this additional Red&#160;Hat subscription, you can use the Community Windows Machine Config Operator, a distribution that lacks official support.
