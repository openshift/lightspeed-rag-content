# Red Hat OpenShift support for Windows Containers release notes


The release notes for Red Hat OpenShift for Windows Containers tracks the development of the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO), which provides all Windows container workload capabilities in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

# Windows Machine Config Operator numbering

Y-stream releases of the WMCO are in step with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, with only z-stream releases between Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform releases. The WMCO numbering reflects the associated Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version in the y-stream position. For example, the current release of WMCO is associated with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.16. Thus, the numbering is WMCO 10.16.z.

# Release notes for Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator 10.16.2

This release of the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) provides new features and bug fixes for running Windows compute nodes in an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. The components of the WMCO 10.16.2 were released in RHSA-2025:9136.

## New features and improvements

### The WMCO now defaults to info-level logging

The WMCO is configured to use the info log level by default. You can change the log level to debug by editing the WMCO subscription object.

## Bug fixes

* Previously, Windows nodes were unable to pull from image mirror registries if an organization name or namespace was included in the source of the ImageTagMirrorSet (ITMS) object. With this fix, you can include an organization name or namespace in the ITMS object. With this change, additional guidelines and requirements around using mirror registries have been added to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform documentation. (OCPBUGS-55787)
