# Service Mesh overview



Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh manages and secures communication between microservices by providing traffic management, advanced routing, and load balancing. Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh also enhances security through features like mutual TLS, and offers observability with metrics, logging, and tracing to monitor and troubleshoot applications.


[NOTE]
----
Because Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh 3.0 releases on a different cadence from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, the Service Mesh documentation is available as a separate documentation set at About Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh.
