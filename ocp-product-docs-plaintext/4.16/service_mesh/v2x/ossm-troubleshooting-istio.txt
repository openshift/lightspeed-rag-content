Troubleshooting your service mesh

This section describes how to identify and resolve common problems in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh. Use the following sections to help troubleshoot and debug problems when deploying Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
Understanding Service Mesh versions
In order to understand what version of Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh you have deployed on your system, you need to understand how each of the component versions is managed.

Operator version - The most current Operator version is 2.5.1. The Operator version number only indicates the version of the currently installed Operator. Because the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator supports multiple versions of the Service Mesh control plane, the version of the Operator does not determine the version of your deployed ServiceMeshControlPlane resources.

ServiceMeshControlPlane version - The ServiceMeshControlPlane version determines what version of Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh you are using. The value of the spec.version field in the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource controls the architecture and configuration settings that are used to install and deploy Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh. When you create the Service Mesh control plane you can set the version in one of two ways:


Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) does not manage Service Mesh control plane upgrades, so the version number for your Operator and ServiceMeshControlPlane (SMCP) may not match, unless you have manually upgraded your SMCP.
Troubleshooting Operator installation
Validating Operator installation
When you install the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operators, OpenShift automatically creates the following objects as part of a successful Operator installation:

config maps

custom resource definitions

deployments

pods

replica sets

roles

role bindings

secrets

service accounts

services


You can verify that the Operator pods are available and running by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform console.

Navigate to Workloads -> Pods.

Select the openshift-operators namespace.

Verify that the following pods exist and have a status of running:

Select the openshift-operators-redhat namespace.

Verify that the elasticsearch-operator pod exists and has a status of running.


Verify the Operator pods are available and running in the openshift-operators namespace with the following command:

Verify the Elasticsearch operator with the following command:
Troubleshooting service mesh Operators
If you experience Operator issues:

Verify your Operator subscription status.

Verify that you did not install a community version of the Operator, instead of the supported Red Hat version.

Verify that you have the cluster-admin role to install Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh.

Check for any errors in the Operator pod logs if the issue is related to installation of Operators.


You can install Operators only through the OpenShift console, the OperatorHub is not accessible from the command line.
Viewing Operator pod logs
You can view Operator logs by using the oc logs command. Red Hat may request logs to help resolve support cases.

To view Operator pod logs, enter the command:
Troubleshooting the control plane
The Service Mesh control plane is composed of Istiod, which consolidates several previous control plane components (Citadel, Galley, Pilot) into a single binary. Deploying the ServiceMeshControlPlane also creates the other components that make up Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh as described in the architecture topic.

Validating the Service Mesh control plane installation
When you create the Service Mesh control plane, the Service Mesh Operator uses the parameters that you have specified in the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource file to do the following:

Creates the Istio components and deploys the following pods:

Calls the Kiali Operator to create Kaili deployment based on configuration in either the SMCP or the Kiali custom resource.

Calls the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) Operator to create distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) components based on configuration in either the SMCP or the Jaeger custom resource.


Run the following command to see if the Service Mesh control plane pods are available and running, where istio-system is the namespace where you installed the SMCP.

Check the status of the Service Mesh control plane deployment by using the following command. Replace istio-system with the namespace where you deployed the SMCP.

If the SMCP status indicates anything other than ComponentsReady check the status: output in the SCMP resource for more information.

Check the status of the Jaeger deployment with the following command, where istio-system is the namespace where you deployed the SMCP.

Check the status of the Kiali deployment with the following command, where istio-system is the namespace where you deployed the SMCP.


Accessing the Kiali console
You can view your application's topology, health, and metrics in the Kiali console. If your service is experiencing problems, the Kiali console lets you view the data flow through your service. You can view insights about the mesh components at different levels, including abstract applications, services, and workloads. Kiali also provides an interactive graph view of your namespace in real time.

To access the Kiali console you must have Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh installed, Kiali installed and configured.

The installation process creates a route to access the Kiali console.

If you know the URL for the Kiali console, you can access it directly.  If you do not know the URL, use the following directions.

Log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console with an administrator role.

Click Home -> Projects.

On the Projects page, if necessary, use the filter to find the name of your project.

Click the name of your project, for example, bookinfo.

On the Project details page, in the Launcher section, click the Kiali link.

Log in to the Kiali console with the same user name and password that you use to access the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform console.


Log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console with a developer role.

Click Project.

On the Project Details page, if necessary, use the filter to find the name of your project.

Click the name of your project, for example, bookinfo.

On the Project page, in the Launcher section, click the Kiali link.

Click Log In With OpenShift.
Accessing the Jaeger console
To access the Jaeger console you must have Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh installed, Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) installed and configured.

The installation process creates a route to access the Jaeger console.

If you know the URL for the Jaeger console, you can access it directly.  If you do not know the URL, use the following directions.

Starting with Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh 2.5, Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) and OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator have been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Red Hat will provide bug fixes and support for this feature during the current release lifecycle, but this feature will no longer receive enhancements and will be removed. As an alternative to Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger), you can use Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Tempo) instead.
Log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console as a user with cluster-admin rights. If you use Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated, you must have an account with the dedicated-admin role.

Navigate to Networking -> Routes.

On the Routes page, select the Service Mesh control plane project, for example istio-system, from the Namespace menu.

If necessary, use the filter to find the jaeger route.  Click the route Location to launch the console.

Click Log In With OpenShift.


Launch the Kiali console.

Click Distributed Tracing in the left navigation pane.

Click Log In With OpenShift.


Log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI as a user with the cluster-admin role. If you use Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated, you must have an account with the dedicated-admin role.

To query for details of the route using the command line, enter the following command. In this example, istio-system is the Service Mesh control plane namespace.

Launch a browser and navigate to \https://<JAEGER_URL>, where <JAEGER_URL> is the route that you discovered in the previous step.

Log in using the same user name and password that you use to access the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform console.

If you have added services to the service mesh and have generated traces, you can use the filters and Find Traces button to search your trace data.
Troubleshooting the Service Mesh control plane
If you are experiencing issues while deploying the Service Mesh control plane,

Ensure that the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource is installed in a project that is separate from your services and Operators. This documentation uses the istio-system project as an example, but you can deploy your control plane in any project as long as it is separate from the project that contains your Operators and services.

Ensure that the ServiceMeshControlPlane and Jaeger custom resources are deployed in the same project. For example, use the istio-system project for both.
Troubleshooting the data plane
The data plane is a set of intelligent proxies that intercept and control all inbound and outbound network communications between services in the service mesh.

Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh relies on a proxy sidecar within the application’s pod to provide service mesh capabilities to the application.

Troubleshooting sidecar injection
Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh does not automatically inject proxy sidecars to pods. You must opt in to sidecar injection.

Troubleshooting Istio sidecar injection
Check to see if automatic injection is enabled in the Deployment for your application. If automatic injection for the Envoy proxy is enabled, there should be a sidecar.istio.io/inject:"true" annotation in the Deployment resource under spec.template.metadata.annotations.
Troubleshooting Jaeger agent sidecar injection
Check to see if automatic injection is enabled in the Deployment for your application. If automatic injection for the Jaeger agent is enabled, there should be a sidecar.jaegertracing.io/inject:"true" annotation in the Deployment resource.

For more information about sidecar injection, see Enabling automatic injection
Troubleshooting Envoy proxy
The Envoy proxy intercepts all inbound and outbound traffic for all services in the service mesh. Envoy also collects and reports telemetry on the service mesh. Envoy is deployed as a sidecar to the relevant service in the same pod.

Enabling Envoy access logs
Envoy access logs are useful in diagnosing traffic failures and flows, and help with end-to-end traffic flow analysis.

To enable access logging for all istio-proxy containers, edit the ServiceMeshControlPlane (SMCP) object to add a file name for the logging output.

Log in to the OpenShift Container Platform CLI as a user with the cluster-admin role. Enter the following command. Then, enter your username and password when prompted.

Change to the project where you installed the Service Mesh control plane, for example istio-system.

Edit the ServiceMeshControlPlane file.

As show in the following example, use name to specify the file name for the proxy log. If you do not specify a value for name, no log entries will be written.
