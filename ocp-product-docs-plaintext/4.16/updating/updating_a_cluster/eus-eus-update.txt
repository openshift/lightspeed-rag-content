Performing an EUS-to-EUS update

Due to fundamental Kubernetes design, all Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform updates between minor versions must be serialized. You must update from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform <4.y> to <4.y+1>, and then to <4.y+2>. You cannot update from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform <4.y> to <4.y+2> directly. However, administrators who want to update between two Extended Update Support (EUS) versions can do so incurring only a single reboot of non-control plane hosts.

EUS-to-EUS updates are only viable between even-numbered minor versions of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
There are a number of caveats to consider when attempting an EUS-to-EUS update.

EUS-to-EUS updates are only offered after updates between all versions involved have been made available in stable channels.

If you encounter issues during or after updating to the odd-numbered minor version but before updating to the next even-numbered version, then remediation of those issues may require that non-control plane hosts complete the update to the odd-numbered version before moving forward.

You can do a partial update by updating the worker or custom pool nodes to accommodate the time it takes for maintenance.

You can complete the update process during multiple maintenance windows by pausing at intermediate steps. However, plan to complete the entire update within 60 days. This is critical to ensure that normal cluster automation processes are completed.

Until the machine config pools are unpaused and the update is complete, some features and bugs fixes in <4.y+1> and <4.y+2> of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform are not available.

All the clusters might update using EUS channels for a conventional update without pools paused, but only clusters with non control-plane MachineConfigPools objects can do EUS-to-EUS update with pools paused.
EUS-to-EUS update
The following procedure pauses all non-master machine config pools and performs updates from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform <4.y> to <4.y+1> to <4.y+2>, then unpauses the previously paused machine config pools. Following this procedure reduces the total update duration and the number of times worker nodes are restarted.

Review the release notes for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform <4.y+1> and <4.y+2>

Review the release notes and product lifecycles for any layered products and Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) Operators. Some may require updates either before or during an EUS-to-EUS update.

Ensure that you are familiar with version-specific prerequisites, such as the removal of deprecated APIs, that are required prior to updating from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform <4.y+1> to <4.y+2>.


EUS-to-EUS update using the web console
Verify that machine config pools are unpaused.

Have access to the web console as a user with admin privileges.


Using the Administrator perspective on the web console, update any Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) Operators to the versions that are compatible with your intended updated version. You can find more information on how to perform this action in "Updating installed Operators"; see "Additional resources".

Verify that all machine config pools display a status of Up to date and that no machine config pool displays a status of UPDATING.

Set your channel to eus-<4.y+2>.

Pause all worker machine pools except for the master pool. You can perform this action on the MachineConfigPools tab under the Compute page. Select the vertical ellipses next to the machine config pool you'd like to pause and click Pause updates.

Update to version <4.y+1> and complete up to the Save step. You can find more information on how to perform these actions in "Updating a cluster by using the web console"; see "Additional resources".

Ensure that the <4.y+1> updates are complete by viewing the Last completed version of your cluster. You can find this information on the Cluster Settings page under the Details tab.

If necessary, update your OLM Operators by using the Administrator perspective on the web console. You can find more information on how to perform these actions in "Updating installed Operators"; see "Additional resources".

Update to version <4.y+2> and complete up to the Save step. You can find more information on how to perform these actions in "Updating a cluster by using the web console"; see "Additional resources".

Ensure that the <4.y+2> update is complete by viewing the Last completed version of your cluster. You can find this information on the Cluster Settings page under the Details tab.

Unpause all previously paused machine config pools. You can perform this action on the MachineConfigPools tab under the Compute page. Select the vertical ellipses next to the machine config pool you'd like to unpause and click Unpause updates.

Verify that your previously paused pools are updated and that your cluster has completed the update to version <4.y+2>.

EUS-to-EUS update using the CLI
Verify that machine config pools are unpaused.

Update the OpenShift CLI (oc) to the target version before each update.


It is highly discouraged to skip this prerequisite. If the OpenShift CLI (oc) is not updated to the target version before your update, unexpected issues may occur.
Using the Administrator perspective on the web console, update any Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) Operators to the versions that are compatible with your intended updated version. You can find more information on how to perform this action in "Updating installed Operators"; see "Additional resources".

Verify that all machine config pools display a status of UPDATED and that no machine config pool displays a status of UPDATING.
To view the status of all machine config pools, run the following command:

Your current version is <4.y>, and your intended version to update is <4.y+2>. Change to the eus-<4.y+2> channel by running the following command:

Pause all worker machine pools except for the master pool by running the following command:

Update to the latest version by running the following command:

Review the cluster version to ensure that the updates are complete by running the following command:

Update to version <4.y+2> by running the following command:

Retrieve the cluster version to ensure that the <4.y+2> updates are complete by running the following command:

To update your worker nodes to <4.y+2>, unpause all previously paused machine config pools by running the following command:

Verify that your previously paused pools are updated and that the update to version <4.y+2> is complete by running the following command:

EUS-to-EUS update for layered products and Operators installed through Operator Lifecycle Manager
In addition to the EUS-to-EUS update steps mentioned for the web console and CLI, there are additional steps to consider when performing EUS-to-EUS updates for clusters with the following:

Layered products

Operators installed through Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)


Layered products refer to products that are made of multiple underlying products that are intended to be used together and cannot be broken into individual subscriptions. For examples of layered Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform products, see Layered Offering On OpenShift.

As you perform an EUS-to-EUS update for the clusters of layered products and those of Operators that have been installed through OLM, you must complete the following:

You have updated all Operators previously installed through Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to a version that is compatible with your target release. Updating the Operators ensures they have a valid update path when the default OperatorHub catalogs switch from the current minor version to the next during a cluster update. See "Updating installed Operators" in the "Additional resources" section for more information on how to check compatibility and, if necessary, update the installed Operators.

Confirm the cluster version compatibility between the current and intended Operator versions. You can verify which versions your OLM Operators are compatible with by using the Red Hat Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Operator Update Information Checker.


As an example, here are the steps to perform an EUS-to-EUS update from <4.y> to <4.y+2> for OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF). This can be done through the CLI or web console. For information on how to update clusters through your desired interface, see EUS-to-EUS update using the web console and "EUS-to-EUS update using the CLI" in "Additional resources".

Pause the worker machine pools.

Update OpenShift <4.y> -> OpenShift <4.y+1>.

Update ODF <4.y> -> ODF <4.y+1>.

Update OpenShift <4.y+1> -> OpenShift <4.y+2>.

Update to ODF <4.y+2>.

Unpause the worker machine pools.


The update to ODF <4.y+2> can happen before or after worker machine pools have been unpaused.
