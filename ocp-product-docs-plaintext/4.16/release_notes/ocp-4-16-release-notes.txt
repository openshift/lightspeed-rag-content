# About this release

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHSA-2023:7198) is now available. This release uses Kubernetes 1.29 with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 are included in this topic.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 clusters are available at https://console.redhat.com/openshift. With the Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager application for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, you can deploy Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters to either on-premises or cloud environments.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 is supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.8 and 8.9, and on Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) 4.15.

You must use RHCOS machines for the control plane, and you can use either RHCOS or RHEL for compute machines.

For Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 on x86_64 architecture, Red Hat has added a 6-month Extended Update Support (EUS) phase that extends the total available lifecycle from 18 months to 24 months. For Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 running on 64-bit ARM (aarch64), IBM Power&#174; (ppc64le), and IBM Z&#174; (s390x) architectures, the EUS lifecycle remains at 18 months.

Starting with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14, each EUS phase for even numbered releases on all supported architectures, including x86_64, 64-bit ARM (aarch64), IBM Power&#174; (ppc64le), and IBM Z&#174; (s390x) architectures, has a total available lifecycle of 24 months.

Starting with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14, Red Hat offers a 12-month additional EUS add-on, denoted as Additional EUS Term 2, that extends the total available lifecycle from 24 months to 36 months. The Additional EUS Term 2 is available on all architecture variants of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

For more information about this support, see the Red Hat Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy.

Maintenance support ends for version 4.12 on 25 January 2025 and goes to extended life phase. For more information, see the Red Hat Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy.

Commencing with the 4.16 release, Red Hat is simplifying the administration and management of Red Hat shipped cluster Operators with the introduction of three new life cycle classifications; Platform Aligned, Platform Agnostic, and Rolling Stream. These life cycle classifications provide additional ease and transparency for cluster administrators to understand the life cycle policies of each Operator and form cluster maintenance and upgrade plans with predictable support boundaries. For more information, see OpenShift Operator Life Cycles.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is designed for FIPS. When running Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) booted in FIPS mode, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform core components use the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures.

For more information about the NIST validation program, see Cryptographic Module Validation Program. For the latest NIST status for the individual versions of RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted for validation, see Compliance Activities and Government Standards.

# Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform layered and dependent component support and compatibility

The scope of support for layered and dependent components of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform changes independently of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version. To determine the current support status and compatibility for an add-on, refer to its release notes. For more information, see the Red Hat Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Life Cycle Policy.

# New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

## Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS)

### RHCOS now uses RHEL 9.4

RHCOS now uses Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9.4 packages in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16. These packages ensure that your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform instances receive the latest fixes, features, enhancements, hardware support, and driver updates. As an Extended Update Support (EUS) release, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14 is excluded from this change and will continue to use RHEL 9.2 EUS packages for the entirety of its lifecycle.

## Installation and update

### Optional cloud controller manager cluster capability

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, you can disable the cloud controller manager capability during installation.
For more information, see Cloud controller manager capability.

## Web console

### Administrator perspective

This release introduces the following updates to the Administrator perspective of the web console:

### Developer Perspective

This release introduces the following updates to the Developer perspective of the web console:

## OpenShift CLI (oc)

### Introducing the oc adm upgrade status command (Technology Preview)

Previously, the oc adm upgrade command provided limited information about the status of a cluster update. This release adds the oc adm upgrade status command, which decouples status information from the oc adm upgrade command and provides specific information regarding a cluster update, including the status of the control plane and worker node updates.

### Warning for duplicate resource short names

With this release, if you query a resource by using its short name, the OpenShift CLI  (oc) returns a warning if more than one custom resource definition (CRD) with the same short name exists in the cluster.


```terminal
Warning: short name "ex" could also match lower priority resource examples.test.com
```


### New flag to require confirmation when deleting resources (Technology Preview)

This release introduces a new --interactive flag for the oc delete command. When the --interactive flag is set to true, the resource is deleted only if the user confirms the deletion. This flag is available as a Technology Preview feature.

## IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE



## IBM Power



## Authentication and authorization



## Networking

### Define multiple CIDR blocks for one network security group (NSG) rule

With this release, IP addresses and ranges are handled more efficiently in NSGs for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters hosted on Azure. As a result, the maximum limit of CIDRs for all Ingress Controllers in Azure clusters, using the allowedSourceRanges field, increases from approximately 1000 to 4000 CIDRs.

### Migration from OpenShift SDN to OVN-Kubernetes on Nutanix

With this release, migration from the OpenShift SDN network plugin to OVN-Kubernetes is now supported on Nutanix platforms. For more information, see Migration to the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin.

### Improved integration between CoreDNS and egress firewall (Technology Preview)

With this release, OVN-Kubernetes uses a new DNSNameResolver custom resource to keep track of DNS records in your egress firewall rules, and is available as a Technology Preview. This custom resource supports the use of both wildcard DNS names and regular DNS names and allows access to DNS names regardless of the IP addresses associated with its change.

For more information, see Improved DNS resolution and resolving wildcard domain names.

### Parallel node draining during SR-IOV network policy updates

With this update, you can configure the SR-IOV Network Operator to drain nodes in parallel during network policy updates. The option to drain nodes in parallel enables faster rollouts of SR-IOV network configurations. You can use the SriovNetworkPoolConfig custom resource to configure parallel node draining and define the maximum number of nodes in the pool that the Operator can drain in parallel.

For further information, see Configuring parallel node draining during SR-IOV network policy updates.

### Supporting double-tagged packets (QinQ)

This release introduces 802.1Q-in-802.1Q also known as QinQ support. QinQ introduces a second VLAN tag, where the service provider designates the outer tag for their use, offering them flexibility, while the inner tag remains dedicated to the customer’s VLAN. When two VLAN tags are present in a packet, the outer VLAN tag can be either 802.1Q or 802.1ad. The inner VLAN tag must always be 802.1Q.

For more information, see Configuring QinQ support for SR-IOV enabled workloads.

### Configuring a user-managed load balancer for on-premise infrastructure

With this release, you can configure an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on any on-premise infrastructure, such as bare-metal, VMware vSphere, Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP), or Nutanix, to use a user-managed load balancer in place of the default load balancer. For this configuration, you must specify loadBalancer.type: UserManaged in your cluster’s install-config.yaml file.

For more information about this feature on bare-metal infrastructure, see Services for a user-managed load balancer in Setting up the environment for an OpenShift installation.

## Machine Config Operator

With this release, you can now garbage collect unused rendered machine configs. By using the oc adm prune renderedmachineconfigs command, you can view the unused rendered machine configs, determine which to remove, then batch delete the rendered machine configs you no longer need. Having too many machine configs can make working with the machine configs confusing and can also contribute to disk space and performance issues. For more information, see Managing unused rendered machine configs.

## Machine management

### Configuring expanders for the cluster autoscaler

With this release, the cluster autoscaler can use the LeastWaste, Priority, and Random expanders.
You can configure these expanders to influence the selection of machine sets when scaling the cluster.
For more information, see Configuring the cluster autoscaler.

### Managing machines with the Cluster API for VMware vSphere (Technology Preview)

This release introduces the ability to manage machines by using the upstream Cluster API, integrated into Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, as a Technology Preview for VMware vSphere clusters.
This capability is in addition or an alternative to managing machines with the Machine API.
For more information, see Managing machines with the Cluster API.

## Monitoring



## Network Observability Operator

The Network Observability Operator releases updates independently from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform minor version release stream. Updates are available through a single, Rolling Stream which is supported on all currently supported versions of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4. Information regarding new features, enhancements, and bug fixes for the Network Observability Operator is found in the Network Observability release notes.

## Scalability and performance

### Workload partitioning enhancement

With this release, platform pods deployed with a workload annotation that includes both CPU limits and CPU requests have the CPU limits accurately calculated and applied as a CPU quota for the specific pod. In earlier releases, if a workload partitioned pod had both CPU limits and requests set, they were ignored by the webhook. The pod did not benefit from workload partitioning and was not locked down to specific cores. This update ensures the requests and limits are now interpreted correctly by the webhook.


[NOTE]
----
It is expected that if the values for CPU limits are different from the value for requests in the annotation, the CPU limits are taken as being the same as the requests.
----

For more information, see Workload partitioning.

### Linux Control Groups version 2 is now supported with the performance profile feature

Beginning with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, Control Groups version 2 (cgroup v2), also known as cgroup2 or cgroupsv2, is enabled by default for all new deployments, even when performance profiles are present.

Since Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.14, cgroups v2 has been the default, but the performance profile feature required the use of cgroups v1. This issue has been resolved.

cgroup v1 is still used in upgraded clusters with performance profiles that have initial installation dates before Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16. cgroup v1 can still be used in the current version by changing the cgroupMode field in the node.config object to v1.

For more information, see Configuring the Linux cgroup version on your nodes.

## Edge computing

### TALM policy remediation

With this release, Topology Aware Lifecycle Manager (TALM) uses a Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) feature to remediate inform policies on managed clusters. This enhancement removes the need for the Operator to create enforce copies of inform policies during policy remediation. This enhancement also reduces the workload on the hub cluster due to copied policies, and can reduce the overall time required to remediate policies on managed clusters.

For more information, see Update policies on managed clusters.
