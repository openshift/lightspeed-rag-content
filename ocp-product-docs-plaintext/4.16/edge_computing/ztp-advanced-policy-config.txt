Advanced managed cluster configuration with PolicyGenTemplate resources

You can use PolicyGenTemplate CRs to deploy custom functionality in your managed clusters.
Deploying additional changes to clusters
If you require cluster configuration changes outside of the base GitOps Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) pipeline configuration, there are three options:


Apply the additional configuration after the GitOps ZTP pipeline is complete
When the GitOps ZTP pipeline deployment is complete, the deployed cluster is ready for application workloads. At this point, you can install additional Operators and apply configurations specific to your requirements. Ensure that additional configurations do not negatively affect the performance of the platform or allocated CPU budget.
Add content to the GitOps ZTP library
The base source custom resources (CRs) that you deploy with the GitOps ZTP pipeline can be augmented with custom content as required.
Create extra manifests for the cluster installation
Extra manifests are applied during installation and make the installation process more efficient.


Providing additional source CRs or modifying existing source CRs can significantly impact the performance or CPU profile of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
Customizing extra installation manifests in the GitOps ZTP pipeline
Using PolicyGenTemplate CRs to override source CRs content
PolicyGenTemplate custom resources (CRs) allow you to overlay additional configuration details on top of the base source CRs provided with the GitOps plugin in the ztp-site-generate container. You can think of PolicyGenTemplate CRs as a logical merge or patch to the base CR. Use PolicyGenTemplate CRs to update a single field of the base CR, or overlay the entire contents of the base CR. You can update values and insert fields that are not in the base CR.

The following example procedure describes how to update fields in the generated PerformanceProfile CR for the reference configuration based on the PolicyGenTemplate CR in the group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml file. Use the procedure as a basis for modifying other parts of the PolicyGenTemplate based on your requirements.

Create a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data. The repository must be accessible from the hub cluster and be defined as a source repository for Argo CD.


Review the baseline source CR for existing content. You can review the source CRs listed in the reference PolicyGenTemplate CRs by extracting them from the GitOps Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) container.

Review the baseline PerformanceProfile CR in ./out/source-crs/PerformanceProfile.yaml:

Update the PolicyGenTemplate entry for PerformanceProfile in the group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml reference file. The following example PolicyGenTemplate CR stanza supplies appropriate CPU specifications, sets the hugepages configuration, and adds a new field that sets globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing to false.

Commit the PolicyGenTemplate change in Git, and then push to the Git repository being monitored by the GitOps ZTP argo CD application.


The GitOps ZTP application generates an RHACM policy that contains the generated PerformanceProfile CR. The contents of that CR are derived by merging the metadata and spec contents from the PerformanceProfile entry in the PolicyGenTemplate onto the source CR. The resulting CR has the following content:

---
apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2
kind: PerformanceProfile
metadata:
    name: openshift-node-performance-profile
spec:
    additionalKernelArgs:
        - idle=poll
        - rcupdate.rcu_normal_after_boot=0
    cpu:
        isolated: 2-19,22-39
        reserved: 0-1,20-21
    globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing: false
    hugepages:
        defaultHugepagesSize: 1G
        pages:
            - count: 10
              size: 1G
    machineConfigPoolSelector:
        pools.operator.machineconfiguration.openshift.io/master: ""
    net:
        userLevelNetworking: true
    nodeSelector:
        node-role.kubernetes.io/master: ""
    numa:
        topologyPolicy: restricted
    realTimeKernel:
        enabled: true
In the /source-crs folder that you extract from the ztp-site-generate container,  the $ syntax is not used for template substitution as implied by the syntax. Rather, if the policyGen tool sees the $ prefix for a string and you do not specify a value for that field in the related PolicyGenTemplate CR, the field is omitted from the output CR entirely.

An exception to this is the $mcp variable in /source-crs YAML files that is substituted with the specified value for mcp from the PolicyGenTemplate CR. For example, in example/policygentemplates/group-du-standard-ranGen.yaml, the value for mcp is worker:

spec:
  bindingRules:
    group-du-standard: ""
  mcp: "worker"
The policyGen tool replace instances of $mcp with worker in the output CRs.
Adding custom content to the GitOps ZTP pipeline
Perform the following procedure to add new content to the GitOps ZTP pipeline.

Create a subdirectory named source-crs in the directory that contains the kustomization.yaml file for the PolicyGenTemplate custom resource (CR).

Add your user-provided CRs to the source-crs subdirectory, as shown in the following example:

Update the required PolicyGenTemplate CRs to include references to the content you added in the source-crs/custom-crs and source-crs/elasticsearch directories. For example:

Commit the PolicyGenTemplate change in Git, and then push to the Git repository that is monitored by the GitOps ZTP Argo CD policies application.

Update the ClusterGroupUpgrade CR to include the changed PolicyGenTemplate and save it as cgu-test.yaml. The following example shows a generated cgu-test.yaml file.

Apply the updated ClusterGroupUpgrade CR by running the following command:


Check that the updates have succeeded by running the following command:
Configuring policy compliance evaluation timeouts for PolicyGenTemplate CRs
Use Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) installed on a hub cluster to monitor and report on whether your managed clusters are compliant with applied policies. RHACM uses policy templates to apply predefined policy controllers and policies. Policy controllers are Kubernetes custom resource definition (CRD) instances.

You can override the default policy evaluation intervals with PolicyGenTemplate custom resources (CRs). You configure duration settings that define how long a ConfigurationPolicy CR can be in a state of policy compliance or non-compliance before RHACM re-evaluates the applied cluster policies.

The GitOps Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) policy generator generates ConfigurationPolicy CR policies with pre-defined policy evaluation intervals. The default value for the noncompliant state is 10 seconds. The default value for the compliant state is 10 minutes. To disable the evaluation interval, set the value to never.

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

You have created a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data.


To configure the evaluation interval for all policies in a PolicyGenTemplate CR, add evaluationInterval to the spec field, and then set the appropriate compliant and noncompliant values. For example:

To configure the evaluation interval for the spec.sourceFiles object in a PolicyGenTemplate CR, add evaluationInterval to the sourceFiles field, for example:

Commit the PolicyGenTemplate CRs files in the Git repository and push your changes.


Check that the managed spoke cluster policies are monitored at the expected intervals.

Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges on the managed cluster.

Get the pods that are running in the open-cluster-management-agent-addon namespace. Run the following command:

Check the applied policies are being evaluated at the expected interval in the logs for the config-policy-controller pod:
Signalling GitOps ZTP cluster deployment completion with validator inform policies
Create a validator inform policy that signals when the GitOps Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) installation and configuration of the deployed cluster is complete. This policy can be used for deployments of single-node OpenShift clusters, three-node clusters, and standard clusters.

Create a standalone PolicyGenTemplate custom resource (CR) that contains the source file
validatorCRs/informDuValidator.yaml. You only need one standalone PolicyGenTemplate CR for each cluster type. For example, this CR applies a validator inform policy for single-node OpenShift clusters:

Commit the PolicyGenTemplate CR file in your Git repository and push the changes.


Upgrading GitOps ZTP
Configuring power states using PolicyGenTemplates CRs
For low latency and high-performance edge deployments, it is necessary to disable or limit C-states and P-states. With this configuration, the CPU runs at a constant frequency, which is typically the maximum turbo frequency. This ensures that the CPU is always running at its maximum speed, which results in high performance and low latency. This leads to the best latency for workloads. However, this also leads to the highest power consumption, which might not be necessary for all workloads.

Workloads can be classified as critical or non-critical, with critical workloads requiring disabled C-state and P-state settings for high performance and low latency, while non-critical workloads use C-state and P-state settings for power savings at the expense of some latency and performance. You can configure the following three power states using GitOps Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP):

High-performance mode provides ultra low latency at the highest power consumption.

Performance mode provides low latency at a relatively high power consumption.

Power saving balances reduced power consumption with increased latency.


The default configuration is for a low latency, performance mode.

PolicyGenTemplate custom resources (CRs) allow you to overlay additional configuration details onto the base source CRs provided with the GitOps plugin in the ztp-site-generate container.

Configure the power states by updating the workloadHints fields in the generated PerformanceProfile CR for the reference configuration, based on the PolicyGenTemplate CR in the group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml.

The following common prerequisites apply to configuring all three power states.

You have created a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data. The repository must be accessible from the hub cluster and be defined as a source repository for Argo CD.

You have followed the procedure described in "Preparing the GitOps ZTP site configuration repository".

Update the PolicyGenTemplate entry for PerformanceProfile in the group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml reference file in out/argocd/example/policygentemplates as follows to configure power saving mode. It is recommended to configure the CPU governor for the power saving mode through the additional kernel arguments object.

Commit the PolicyGenTemplate change in Git, and then push to the Git repository being monitored by the GitOps ZTP Argo CD application.


Select a worker node in your deployed cluster from the list of nodes identified by using the following command:

Log in to the node by using the following command:

Set /host as the root directory within the debug shell. The debug pod mounts the host’s root file system in /host within the pod. By changing the root directory to /host, you can run binaries contained in the host’s executable paths as shown in the following example:

Run the following command to verify the applied power state:


For power saving mode the intel_pstate=passive.


Configuring power saving for nodes that run colocated high and low priority workloads

Configuring host firmware for low latency and high performance

Preparing the GitOps ZTP site configuration repository
Maximizing power savings
Limiting the maximum CPU frequency is recommended to achieve maximum power savings. Enabling C-states on the non-critical workload CPUs without restricting the maximum CPU frequency negates much of the power savings by boosting the frequency of the critical CPUs.

Maximize power savings by updating the sysfs plugin fields, setting an appropriate value for max_perf_pct in the TunedPerformancePatch CR for the reference configuration. This example based on the group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml describes the procedure to follow to restrict the maximum CPU frequency.

You have configured power savings mode as described in "Using PolicyGenTemplate CRs to configure power savings mode".


Update the PolicyGenTemplate entry for TunedPerformancePatch in the group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml reference file in out/argocd/example/policygentemplates. To maximize power savings, add max_perf_pct as shown in the following example:

Configuring the Image Registry Operator for local caching of images
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform manages image caching using a local registry. In edge computing use cases, clusters are often subject to bandwidth restrictions when communicating with centralized image registries, which might result in long image download times.

Long download times are unavoidable during initial deployment. Over time, there is a risk that CRI-O will erase the /var/lib/containers/storage directory in the case of an unexpected shutdown. To address long image download times, you can create a local image registry on remote managed clusters using GitOps Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP). This is useful in Edge computing scenarios where clusters are deployed at the far edge of the network.

Before you can set up the local image registry with GitOps ZTP, you need to configure disk partitioning in the SiteConfig CR that you use to install the remote managed cluster. After installation, you configure the local image registry using a PolicyGenTemplate CR. Then, the GitOps ZTP pipeline creates Persistent Volume (PV) and Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) CRs and patches the imageregistry configuration.

The local image registry can only be used for user application images and cannot be used for the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform or Operator Lifecycle Manager operator images.
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform registry overview.


Configuring disk partitioning with SiteConfig
Configure disk partitioning for a managed cluster using a SiteConfig CR and GitOps Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP). The  disk partition details in the SiteConfig CR must match the underlying disk.

Use persistent naming for devices to avoid device names such as /dev/sda and /dev/sdb being switched at every reboot. You can use rootDeviceHints to choose the bootable device and then use same device for further partitioning.
You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

Save the SiteConfig CR and push it to the site configuration repo.


The GitOps ZTP pipeline provisions the cluster using the SiteConfig CR and configures the disk partition.
Configuring the image registry using PolicyGenTemplate CRs
Use PolicyGenTemplate (PGT) CRs to apply the CRs required to configure the image registry and patch the imageregistry configuration.

You have configured a disk partition in the managed cluster.

You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

You have created a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data for use with GitOps Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP).

Accessing the registry
Using hub templates in PolicyGenTemplate CRs
Topology Aware Lifecycle Manager supports partial Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) hub cluster template functions in configuration policies used with GitOps Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP).

Hub-side cluster templates allow you to define configuration policies that can be dynamically customized to the target clusters. This reduces the need to create separate policies for many clusters with similiar configurations but with different values.

Policy templates are restricted to the same namespace as the namespace where the policy is defined. This means that you must create the objects referenced in the hub template in the same namespace where the policy is created.
The following supported hub template functions are available for use in GitOps ZTP with TALM:

fromConfigmap returns the value of the provided data key in the named ConfigMap resource.

base64enc returns the base64-encoded value of the input string

base64dec returns the decoded value of the base64-encoded input string

indent returns the input string with added indent spaces

autoindent returns the input string with added indent spaces based on the spacing used in the parent template

toInt casts and returns the integer value of the input value

toBool converts the input string into a boolean value, and returns the boolean


Various Open source community functions are also available for use with GitOps ZTP.

RHACM support for hub cluster templates in configuration policies


Example hub templates
The following code examples are valid hub templates. Each of these templates return values from the ConfigMap CR with the name test-config in the default namespace.

Returns the value with the key common-key:

Returns a string by using the concatenated value of the .ManagedClusterName field and the string -name:

Casts and returns a boolean value from the concatenated value of the .ManagedClusterName field and the string -name:

Casts and returns an integer value from the concatenated value of the .ManagedClusterName field and the string -name:
Specifying group and site configuration in group PolicyGenTemplate CRs with hub templates
You can manage the configuration of fleets of clusters with ConfigMap CRs by using hub templates to populate the group and site values in the generated policies that get applied to the managed clusters. Using hub templates in site PolicyGenTemplate (PGT) CRs means that you do not need to create a PolicyGenTemplate CR for each site.

You can group the clusters in a fleet in various categories, depending on the use case, for example hardware type or region. Each cluster should have a label corresponding to the group or groups that the cluster is in. If you manage the configuration values for each group in different ConfigMap CRs, then you require only one group PolicyGenTemplate CR to apply the changes to all the clusters in the group by using hub templates.

The following example shows you how to use three ConfigMap CRs and one group PolicyGenTemplate CR to apply both site and group configuration to clusters grouped by hardware type and region.

When you use the fromConfigmap function, the printf variable is only available for the template resource data key fields. You cannot use it with name and namespace fields.
You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).

You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

You have created a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data.
The repository must be accessible from the hub cluster and be defined as a source repository for the GitOps ZTP ArgoCD application.


Create three ConfigMap CRs that contain the group and site configuration:

Commit the ConfigMap CRs in Git, and then push to the Git repository being monitored by the Argo CD application.

Apply the hardware type and region labels to the clusters.
The following command applies to a single cluster named du-sno-1-zone-1 and the labels chosen are "hardware-type": "hardware-type-1" and "group-du-sno-zone": "zone-1":

Create a group PolicyGenTemplate CR that uses hub templates to obtain the required data from the ConfigMap objects.
This example PolicyGenTemplate CR configures logging, VLAN IDs, NICs and Performance Profile for the clusters that match the labels listed under spec.bindingRules:

Commit the site PolicyGenTemplate CR in Git and push to the Git repository that is monitored by the ArgoCD application.
Syncing new ConfigMap changes to existing PolicyGenTemplate CRs
