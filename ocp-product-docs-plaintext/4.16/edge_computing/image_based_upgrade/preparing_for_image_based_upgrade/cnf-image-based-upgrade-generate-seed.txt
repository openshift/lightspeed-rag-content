# Generating a seed image for the image-based upgrade with the Lifecycle Agent


Use the Lifecycle Agent to generate the seed image with the SeedGenerator custom resource (CR).

# Seed image configuration

The seed image targets a set of single-node OpenShift clusters with similar configuration.
This means that the seed image must have all of the components and configuration that the seed cluster shares with the target clusters.
Therefore, the seed image generated from the seed cluster cannot contain any cluster-specific configuration.

The following table lists the components, resources, and configurations that you must and must not include in your seed image:



1. Dual-stack networking is not supported in this release.
2. The proxy configuration does not have to be the same.

## Seed image configuration using the RAN DU profile

The following table lists the components, resources, and configurations that you must and must not include in the seed image when using the RAN DU profile:





# Generating a seed image with the Lifecycle Agent

Use the Lifecycle Agent to generate the seed image with the SeedGenerator CR. The Operator checks for required system configurations, performs any necessary system cleanup before generating the seed image, and launches the image generation. The seed image generation includes the following tasks:

* Stopping cluster Operators
* Preparing the seed image configuration
* Generating and pushing the seed image to the image repository specified in the SeedGenerator CR
* Restoring cluster Operators
* Expiring seed cluster certificates
* Generating new certificates for the seed cluster
* Restoring and updating the SeedGenerator CR on the seed cluster

* Configure a shared container directory on the seed cluster.
* Install the OADP Operator and the Lifecycle Agent on the seed cluster.

1. Detach the cluster from the hub to delete any cluster-specific resources from the seed cluster that must not be in the seed image:
1. If you are using RHACM, manually detach the seed cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete managedcluster sno-worker-example
```

1. Wait until the ManagedCluster CR is removed. After the CR is removed, create the proper SeedGenerator CR. The Lifecycle Agent cleans up the RHACM artifacts.
2. If you are using GitOps ZTP, detach your cluster by removing the seed cluster's SiteConfig CR from the kustomization.yaml:
1. Remove your seed cluster's SiteConfig CR from the kustomization.yaml.

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

generators:
#- example-seed-sno1.yaml
- example-target-sno2.yaml
- example-target-sno3.yaml
```

2. Commit the kustomization.yaml changes in your Git repository and push the changes.

The ArgoCD pipeline detects the changes and removes the managed cluster.
2. Create the Secret:
1. Create the authentication file by running the following commands:

```terminal
$ MY_USER=myuserid
$ AUTHFILE=/tmp/my-auth.json
$ podman login --authfile ${AUTHFILE} -u ${MY_USER} quay.io/${MY_USER}
```


```terminal
$ base64 -w 0 ${AUTHFILE} ; echo
```
2. Copy the output into the seedAuth field in the Secret YAML file named seedgen in the openshift-lifecycle-agent namespace:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: seedgen 1
  namespace: openshift-lifecycle-agent
type: Opaque
data:
  seedAuth: <encoded_AUTHFILE> 2
```

The Secret resource must have the name: seedgen and namespace: openshift-lifecycle-agent fields.
Specifies a base64-encoded authfile for write-access to the registry for pushing the generated seed images.
3. Apply the Secret by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f secretseedgenerator.yaml
```

3. Create the SeedGenerator CR:

```yaml
apiVersion: lca.openshift.io/v1
kind: SeedGenerator
metadata:
  name: seedimage 1
spec:
  seedImage: <seed_container_image> 2
```

The SeedGenerator CR must be named seedimage.
Specify the container image URL, for example, quay.io/example/seed-container-image:<tag>. It is recommended to use the <seed_cluster_name>:<ocp_version> format.
4. Generate the seed image by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f seedgenerator.yaml
```


[IMPORTANT]
----
The cluster reboots and loses API capabilities while the Lifecycle Agent generates the seed image.
Applying the SeedGenerator CR stops the kubelet and the CRI-O operations, then it starts the image generation.
----

If you want to generate more seed images, you must provision a new seed cluster with the version that you want to generate a seed image from.

1. After the cluster recovers and it is available, you can check the status of the SeedGenerator CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get seedgenerator -o yaml
```


```yaml
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2024-02-13T21:24:26Z"
    message: Seed Generation completed
    observedGeneration: 1
    reason: Completed
    status: "False"
    type: SeedGenInProgress
  - lastTransitionTime: "2024-02-13T21:24:26Z"
    message: Seed Generation completed
    observedGeneration: 1
    reason: Completed
    status: "True"
    type: SeedGenCompleted 1
  observedGeneration: 1
```

The seed image generation is complete.
