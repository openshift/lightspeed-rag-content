# Updating GitOps ZTP


You can update the GitOps Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) infrastructure independently from the hub cluster, Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM), and the managed Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters.

[NOTE]
----
You can update the Red Hat OpenShift GitOps Operator when new versions become available. When updating the GitOps ZTP plugin, review the updated files in the reference configuration and ensure that the changes meet your requirements.
----

[IMPORTANT]
----
Using PolicyGenTemplate CRs to manage and deploy polices to managed clusters will be deprecated in an upcoming Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release.
Equivalent and improved functionality is available using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) and PolicyGenerator CRs.
For more information about PolicyGenerator resources, see the RHACM Policy Generator documentation.

# Overview of the GitOps ZTP update process

You can update GitOps Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) for a fully operational hub cluster running an earlier version of the GitOps ZTP infrastructure. The update process avoids impact on managed clusters.


[NOTE]
----
Any changes to policy settings, including adding recommended content, results in updated polices that must be rolled out to the managed clusters and reconciled.
----

At a high level, the strategy for updating the GitOps ZTP infrastructure is as follows:

1. Label all existing clusters with the ztp-done label.
2. Stop the ArgoCD applications.
3. Install the new GitOps ZTP tools.
4. Update required content and optional changes in the Git repository.
5. Enable pulling the ISO images for the desired Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version.
6. Update and restart the application configuration.

# Preparing for the upgrade

Use the following procedure to prepare your site for the GitOps Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) upgrade.

1. Get the latest version of the GitOps ZTP container that has the custom resources (CRs) used to configure Red Hat OpenShift GitOps for use with GitOps ZTP.
2. Extract the argocd/deployment directory by using the following commands:

```terminal
$ mkdir -p ./update
```


```terminal
$ podman run --log-driver=none --rm registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ztp-site-generate-rhel8:v4.16 extract /home/ztp --tar | tar x -C ./update
```


The /update directory contains the following subdirectories:
* update/extra-manifest: contains the source CR files that the SiteConfig CR uses to generate the extra manifest configMap.
* update/source-crs: contains the source CR files that the PolicyGenerator or PolicyGentemplate CR uses to generate the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) policies.
* update/argocd/deployment: contains patches and YAML files to apply on the hub cluster for use in the next step of this procedure.
* update/argocd/example: contains example SiteConfig and PolicyGenerator or PolicyGentemplate files that represent the recommended configuration.
3. Update the clusters-app.yaml and policies-app.yaml files to reflect the name of your applications and the URL, branch, and path for your Git repository.

If the upgrade includes changes that results in obsolete policies, the obsolete policies should be removed prior to performing the upgrade.
4. Diff the changes between the configuration and deployment source CRs in the /update folder and Git repo where you manage your fleet site CRs. Apply and push the required changes to your site repository.

[IMPORTANT]
----
When you update GitOps ZTP to the latest version, you must apply the changes from the update/argocd/deployment directory to your site repository. Do not use older versions of the argocd/deployment/ files.
----

# Labeling the existing clusters

To ensure that existing clusters remain untouched by the tool updates, label all existing managed clusters with the ztp-done label.


[NOTE]
----
This procedure only applies when updating clusters that were not provisioned with Topology Aware Lifecycle Manager (TALM). Clusters that you provision with TALM are automatically labeled with ztp-done.
----

1. Find a label selector that lists the managed clusters that were deployed with GitOps Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP), such as local-cluster!=true:

```terminal
$ oc get managedcluster -l 'local-cluster!=true'
```

2. Ensure that the resulting list contains all the managed clusters that were deployed with GitOps ZTP, and then use that selector to add the ztp-done label:

```terminal
$ oc label managedcluster -l 'local-cluster!=true' ztp-done=
```


# Stopping the existing GitOps ZTP applications

Removing the existing applications ensures that any changes to existing content in the Git repository are not rolled out until the new version of the tools is available.

Use the application files from the deployment directory. If you used custom names for the applications, update the names in these files first.

1. Perform a non-cascaded delete on the clusters application to leave all generated resources in place:

```terminal
$ oc delete -f update/argocd/deployment/clusters-app.yaml
```

2. Perform a cascaded delete on the policies application to remove all previous policies:

```terminal
$ oc patch -f policies-app.yaml -p '{"metadata": {"finalizers": ["resources-finalizer.argocd.argoproj.io"]}}' --type merge
```


```terminal
$ oc delete -f update/argocd/deployment/policies-app.yaml
```


# Required changes to the Git repository

When upgrading the ztp-site-generate container from an earlier release of GitOps Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) to 4.10 or later, there are additional requirements for the contents of the Git repository. Existing content in the repository must be updated to reflect these changes.


[NOTE]
----
The following procedure assumes you are using PolicyGenerator resources instead of PolicyGentemplate resources for cluster policies management.
----

* Make required changes to PolicyGenerator files:

All PolicyGenerator files must be created in a Namespace prefixed with ztp. This ensures that the GitOps ZTP application is able to manage the policy CRs generated by GitOps ZTP without conflicting with the way Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) manages the policies internally.
* Add the kustomization.yaml file to the repository:

All SiteConfig and PolicyGenerator CRs must be included in a kustomization.yaml file under their respective directory trees. For example:

```terminal
├── acmpolicygenerator
│   ├── site1-ns.yaml
│   ├── site1.yaml
│   ├── site2-ns.yaml
│   ├── site2.yaml
│   ├── common-ns.yaml
│   ├── common-ranGen.yaml
│   ├── group-du-sno-ranGen-ns.yaml
│   ├── group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml
│   └── kustomization.yaml
└── siteconfig
    ├── site1.yaml
    ├── site2.yaml
    └── kustomization.yaml
```


[NOTE]
----
The files listed in the generator sections must contain either SiteConfig or {policy-gen-cr} CRs only. If your existing YAML files contain other CRs, for example, Namespace, these other CRs must be pulled out into separate files and listed in the resources section.
----

The PolicyGenerator kustomization file must contain all PolicyGenerator YAML files in the generator section and Namespace CRs in the resources section. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

generators:
- acm-common-ranGen.yaml
- acm-group-du-sno-ranGen.yaml
- site1.yaml
- site2.yaml

resources:
- common-ns.yaml
- acm-group-du-sno-ranGen-ns.yaml
- site1-ns.yaml
- site2-ns.yaml
```


The SiteConfig kustomization file must contain all SiteConfig YAML files in the generator section and any other CRs in the resources:

```terminal
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

generators:
- site1.yaml
- site2.yaml
```

* Remove the pre-sync.yaml and post-sync.yaml files.

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 and later, the pre-sync.yaml and post-sync.yaml files are no longer required. The update/deployment/kustomization.yaml CR manages the policies deployment on the hub cluster.

[NOTE]
----
There is a set of pre-sync.yaml and post-sync.yaml files under both the SiteConfig and {policy-gen-cr} trees.
----
* Review and incorporate recommended changes

Each release may include additional recommended changes to the configuration applied to deployed clusters. Typically these changes result in lower CPU use by the OpenShift platform, additional features, or improved tuning of the platform.

Review the reference SiteConfig and PolicyGenerator CRs applicable to the types of cluster in your network. These examples can be found in the argocd/example directory extracted from the GitOps ZTP container.

# Installing the new GitOps ZTP applications

Using the extracted argocd/deployment directory, and after ensuring that the applications point to your site Git repository, apply the full contents of the deployment directory. Applying the full contents of the directory ensures that all necessary resources for the applications are correctly configured.

1. To install the GitOps ZTP plugin, patch the ArgoCD instance in the hub cluster with the relevant multicluster engine (MCE) subscription image.
Customize the patch file that you previously extracted into the out/argocd/deployment/ directory for your environment.
1. Select the multicluster-operators-subscription image that matches your RHACM version.
* For RHACM 2.8 and 2.9, use the registry.redhat.io/rhacm2/multicluster-operators-subscription-rhel8:v<rhacm_version> image.
* For RHACM 2.10 and later, use the registry.redhat.io/rhacm2/multicluster-operators-subscription-rhel9:v<rhacm_version> image.

[IMPORTANT]
----
The version of the multicluster-operators-subscription image must match the RHACM version.
Beginning with the MCE 2.10 release, RHEL 9 is the base image for multicluster-operators-subscription images.
Click [Expand for Operator list] in the "Platform Aligned Operators" table in OpenShift Operator Life Cycles to view the complete supported Operators matrix for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
----
2. Modify the out/argocd/deployment/argocd-openshift-gitops-patch.json file with the multicluster-operators-subscription image that matches your RHACM version:

```json
{
  "args": [
    "-c",
    "mkdir -p /.config/kustomize/plugin/policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1/policygenerator && cp /policy-generator/PolicyGenerator-not-fips-compliant /.config/kustomize/plugin/policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1/policygenerator/PolicyGenerator" 1
  ],
  "command": [
    "/bin/bash"
  ],
  "image": "registry.redhat.io/rhacm2/multicluster-operators-subscription-rhel9:v2.10", 2 3
  "name": "policy-generator-install",
  "imagePullPolicy": "Always",
  "volumeMounts": [
    {
      "mountPath": "/.config",
      "name": "kustomize"
    }
  ]
}
```

Optional: For RHEL 9 images, copy the required universal executable in the /policy-generator/PolicyGenerator-not-fips-compliant folder for the ArgoCD version.
Match the multicluster-operators-subscription image to the RHACM version.
In disconnected environments, replace the URL for the multicluster-operators-subscription image with the disconnected registry equivalent for your environment.
3. Patch the ArgoCD instance.
Run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc patch argocd openshift-gitops \
-n openshift-gitops --type=merge \
--patch-file out/argocd/deployment/argocd-openshift-gitops-patch.json
```

2. In RHACM 2.7 and later, the multicluster engine enables the cluster-proxy-addon feature by default.
Apply the following patch to disable the cluster-proxy-addon feature and remove the relevant hub cluster and managed pods that are responsible for this add-on.
Run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc patch multiclusterengines.multicluster.openshift.io multiclusterengine --type=merge --patch-file out/argocd/deployment/disable-cluster-proxy-addon.json
```

3. Apply the pipeline configuration to your hub cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -k out/argocd/deployment
```


# Pulling ISO images for the desired Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version

To pull ISO images for the desired Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version, update the AgentServiceConfig custom resource (CR) with references to the desired ISO and RootFS images that are hosted on the mirror registry HTTP server.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with cluster-admin privileges.
* You have RHACM with MultiClusterHub enabled.
* You have enabled the assisted service.

1. Open the AgentServiceConfig CR to update the spec.osImages field by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc edit AgentServiceConfig
```

2. Update the spec.osImages field in the AgentServiceConfig CR:

```yaml
apiVersion: agent-install.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: AgentServiceConfig
metadata:
 name: agent
spec:
# ...
  osImages:
    - cpuArchitecture: x86_64
      openshiftVersion: "4.16"
      rootFSUrl: https://<host>/<path>/rhcos-live-rootfs.x86_64.img
      url: https://<host>/<path>/rhcos-live.x86_64.iso
```


where:
<host>:: Specifies the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the target mirror registry HTTP server.
<path>:: Specifies the path to the image on the target mirror registry.
3. Save and quit the editor to apply the changes.

# Rolling out the GitOps ZTP configuration changes

If any configuration changes were included in the upgrade due to implementing recommended changes, the upgrade process results in a set of policy CRs on the hub cluster in the Non-Compliant state. With the GitOps Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) version 4.10 and later ztp-site-generate container, these policies are set to inform mode and are not pushed to the managed clusters without an additional step by the user. This ensures that potentially disruptive changes to the clusters can be managed in terms of when the changes are made, for example, during a maintenance window, and how many clusters are updated concurrently.

To roll out the changes, create one or more ClusterGroupUpgrade CRs as detailed in the TALM documentation. The CR must contain the list of Non-Compliant policies that you want to push out to the managed clusters as well as a list or selector of which clusters should be included in the update.
