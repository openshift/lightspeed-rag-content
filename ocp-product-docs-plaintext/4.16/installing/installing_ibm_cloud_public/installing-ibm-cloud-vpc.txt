# Installing a cluster on IBM Cloud into an existing VPC


In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.16, you can install a cluster into an existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on IBM Cloud(R). The installation program provisions the rest of the required infrastructure, which you can then further customize. To customize the installation, you modify parameters in the install-config.yaml file before you install the cluster.

# Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation and update processes.
* You read the documentation on selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users.
* You configured an IBM Cloud(R) account to host the cluster.
* If you use a firewall, you configured it to allow the sites that your cluster requires access to.
* You configured the ccoctl utility before you installed the cluster. For more information, see Configuring IAM for IBM Cloud(R).

# About using a custom VPC

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, you can deploy a cluster into the subnets of an existing IBM&#174; Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Deploying Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform into an existing VPC can help you avoid limit constraints in new accounts or more easily abide by the operational constraints that your company&#8217;s guidelines set. If you cannot obtain the infrastructure creation permissions that are required to create the VPC yourself, use this installation option.

Because the installation program cannot know what other components are in your existing subnets, it cannot choose subnet CIDRs and so forth. You must configure networking for the subnets to which you will install the cluster.

## Requirements for using your VPC

You must correctly configure the existing VPC and its subnets before you install the cluster. The installation program does not create the following components:

* NAT gateways
* Subnets
* Route tables
* VPC network

The installation program cannot:

* Subdivide network ranges for the cluster to use
* Set route tables for the subnets
* Set VPC options like DHCP


[NOTE]
----
The installation program requires that you use the cloud-provided DNS server. Using a custom DNS server is not supported and causes the installation to fail.
----

## VPC validation

The VPC and all of the subnets must be in an existing resource group. The cluster is deployed to the existing VPC.

As part of the installation, specify the following in the install-config.yaml file:

* The name of the existing resource group that contains the VPC and subnets (networkResourceGroupName)
* The name of the existing VPC (vpcName)
* The subnets that were created for control plane machines and compute machines (controlPlaneSubnets and computeSubnets)


[NOTE]
----
Additional installer-provisioned cluster resources are deployed to a separate resource group (resourceGroupName). You can specify this resource group before installing the cluster. If undefined, a new resource group is created for the cluster.
----

To ensure that the subnets that you provide are suitable, the installation program confirms the following:

* All of the subnets that you specify exist.
* For each availability zone in the region, you specify:
* One subnet for control plane machines.
* One subnet for compute machines.
* The machine CIDR that you specified contains the subnets for the compute machines and control plane machines.


[NOTE]
----
Subnet IDs are not supported.
----

## Isolation between clusters

If you deploy Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform to an existing network, the isolation of cluster services is reduced in the following ways:

* You can install multiple Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters in the same VPC.
* ICMP ingress is allowed to the entire network.
* TCP port 22 ingress (SSH) is allowed to the entire network.
* Control plane TCP 6443 ingress (Kubernetes API) is allowed to the entire network.
* Control plane TCP 22623 ingress (MCS) is allowed to the entire network.

# Internet access for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, you require access to the internet to
install
your cluster.

You must have internet access to:

* Access https://console.redhat.com/openshift [OpenShift Cluster Manager] to download the installation program and perform subscription management. If the cluster has internet access and you do not disable Telemetry, that service automatically entitles your cluster.
* Access Quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install your cluster.
* Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.

# Generating a key pair for cluster node SSH access

To enable secure, passwordless SSH access to your cluster nodes, provide an SSH public key during the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation. This ensures that the installation program automatically configures the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) nodes for remote authentication through the core user.

The SSH public key gets added to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys list for the core user on each node. After the key is passed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) nodes through their Ignition config files, you can use the key pair to SSH in to the RHCOS nodes as the user core. To access the nodes through SSH, the private key identity must be managed by SSH for your local user.

If you want to SSH in to your cluster nodes to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, you must provide the SSH public key during the installation process. The ./openshift-install gather command also requires the SSH public key to be in place on the cluster nodes.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not skip this procedure in production environments, where disaster recovery and debugging is required.
----


[NOTE]
----
You must use a local key, not one that you configured with platform-specific
approaches such as
AWS key pairs.
----

1. If you do not have an existing SSH key pair on your local machine to use for authentication onto your cluster nodes, create one. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

```terminal
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N '' -f <path>/<file_name>
```


Specifies the path and file name, such as ~/.ssh/id_ed25519, of the new SSH key. If you have an existing key pair, ensure your public key is in the your ~/.ssh directory.

[NOTE]
----
If you plan to install an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster that uses the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures, do not create a key that uses the ed25519 algorithm. Instead, create a key that uses the rsa or ecdsa algorithm.
----
2. View the public SSH key:

```terminal
$ cat <path>/<file_name>.pub
```


For example, run the following to view the ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub public key:

```terminal
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

3. Add the SSH private key identity to the SSH agent for your local user, if it has not already been added. SSH agent management of the key is required for password-less SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes, or if you want to use the ./openshift-install gather command.

[NOTE]
----
On some distributions, default SSH private key identities such as ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_dsa are managed automatically.
----
1. If the ssh-agent process is not already running for your local user, start it as a background task:

```terminal
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

Example output

```terminal
Agent pid 31874
```


[NOTE]
----
If your cluster is in FIPS mode, only use FIPS-compliant algorithms to generate the SSH key. The key must be either RSA or ECDSA.
----
4. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent:

```terminal
$ ssh-add <path>/<file_name>
```


Specifies the path and file name for your SSH private key, such as ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
Example output

```terminal
Identity added: /home/<you>/<path>/<file_name> (<computer_name>)
```


* When you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, provide the SSH public key to the installation program.

# Obtaining the installation program

Before you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, download the installation file on
 the host you are using for installation.

* You have a computer that runs Linux or macOS, with at least 1.2 GB of local disk space.

1. Go to the Cluster Type page on the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console. If you have a Red Hat account, log in with your credentials. If you do not, create an account.

[TIP]
----
You can also download the binaries for a specific Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release.
----
2. Select your infrastructure provider from the Run it yourself section of the page.
3. Select your host operating system and architecture from the dropdown menus under OpenShift Installer and click Download Installer.
4. Place the downloaded file in the directory where you want to store the installation configuration files.

[IMPORTANT]
----
* The installation program creates several files on the computer that you use to install your cluster. You must keep the installation program and the files that the installation program creates after you finish installing the cluster. Both of the files are required to delete the cluster.
* Deleting the files created by the installation program does not remove your cluster, even if the cluster failed during installation. To remove your cluster, complete the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform uninstallation procedures for your specific cloud provider.
----
5. Extract the installation program. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

```terminal
$ tar -xvf openshift-install-linux.tar.gz
```

6. Download your installation https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret [pull secret from Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager]. This pull secret allows you to authenticate with the services that are provided by the included authorities, including Quay.io, which serves the container images for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform components.

[TIP]
----
Alternatively, you can retrieve the installation program from the Red Hat Customer Portal, where you can specify a version of the installation program to download.
However, you must have an active subscription to access this page.
----

# Exporting the API key

You must set the API key you created as a global variable; the installation program ingests the variable during startup to set the API key.

* You have created either a user API key or service ID API key for your IBM Cloud(R) account.

* Export your API key for your account as a global variable:

```terminal
$ export IC_API_KEY=<api_key>
```



[IMPORTANT]
----
You must set the variable name exactly as specified; the installation program expects the variable name to be present during startup.
----

# Creating the installation configuration file

You can customize the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster you install on
IBM Cloud&#174;.

* You have the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.

1. Create the install-config.yaml file.
1. Change to the directory that contains the installation program and run the following command:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install create install-config --dir <installation_directory>
```

* <installation_directory>: For <installation_directory>, specify the directory name to store the
files that the installation program creates.

When specifying the directory:
* Verify that the directory has the execute permission. This permission is required to run Terraform binaries under the installation directory.
* Use an empty directory. Some installation assets, such as bootstrap X.509 certificates, have short expiration intervals, therefore you must not reuse an installation directory. If you want to reuse individual files from another cluster installation, you can copy them into your directory. However, the file names for the installation assets might change between releases. Use caution when copying installation files from an earlier Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version.
2. At the prompts, provide the configuration details for your cloud:
1. Optional: Select an SSH key to use to access your cluster machines.

[NOTE]
----
For production Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your ssh-agent process uses.
----
2. Select ibmcloud as the platform to target.
3. Select the region to deploy the cluster to.
4. Select the base domain to deploy the cluster to. The base domain corresponds
to the public DNS zone that you created for your cluster.
5. Enter a descriptive name for your cluster.
2. Modify the install-config.yaml file. You can find more information about the available parameters in the "Installation configuration parameters" section.
3. Back up the install-config.yaml file so that you can use
it to install multiple clusters.

[IMPORTANT]
----
The install-config.yaml file is consumed during the installation process. If
you want to reuse the file, you must back it up now.
----

* Installation configuration parameters for IBM Cloud(R)

## Minimum resource requirements for cluster installation

Each created cluster must meet minimum requirements so that the cluster runs as expected.






[NOTE]
----
As of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.13, RHCOS is based on RHEL version 9.2, which updates the micro-architecture requirements. The following list contains the minimum instruction set architectures (ISA) that each architecture requires:
* x86-64 architecture requires x86-64-v2 ISA
* ARM64 architecture requires ARMv8.0-A ISA
* IBM Power architecture requires Power 9 ISA
* s390x architecture requires z14 ISA
For more information, see Architectures (RHEL documentation).
----

If an instance type for your platform meets the minimum requirements for cluster machines, it is supported to use in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

## Tested instance types for IBM Cloud

The following IBM Cloud&#174; instance types have been tested with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

## Sample customized install-config.yaml file for IBM Cloud

You can customize the install-config.yaml file to specify more details about your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster&#8217;s platform or modify the values of the required parameters.


[IMPORTANT]
----
This sample YAML file is provided for reference only. You must obtain your install-config.yaml file by using the installation program and then modify it.

Required. The installation program prompts you for this value.
If you do not provide these parameters and values, the installation program provides the default value.
The controlPlane section is a single mapping, but the compute section is a sequence of mappings. To meet the requirements of the different data structures, the first line of the compute section must begin with a hyphen, -, and the first line of the controlPlane section must not. Only one control plane pool is used.
Enables or disables simultaneous multithreading, also known as Hyper-Threading. By default, simultaneous multithreading is enabled to increase the performance of your machines' cores. You can disable it by setting the parameter value to Disabled. If you disable simultaneous multithreading in some cluster machines, you must disable it in all cluster machines.

[IMPORTANT]
----
If you disable simultaneous multithreading, ensure that your capacity planning accounts for the dramatically decreased machine performance. Use larger machine types, such as n1-standard-8, for your machines if you disable simultaneous multithreading.
----
The machine CIDR must contain the subnets for the compute machines and control plane machines.
The cluster network plugin to install. The default value OVNKubernetes is the only supported value.
The name of an existing resource group. All installer-provisioned cluster resources are deployed to this resource group. If undefined, a new resource group is created for the cluster.
Specify the name of the resource group that contains the existing virtual private cloud (VPC). The existing VPC and subnets should be in this resource group. The cluster will be installed to this VPC.
Specify the name of an existing VPC.
Specify the name of the existing subnets to which to deploy the control plane machines. The subnets must belong to the VPC that you specified. Specify a subnet for each availability zone in the region.
Specify the name of the existing subnets to which to deploy the compute machines. The subnets must belong to the VPC that you specified. Specify a subnet for each availability zone in the region.
Enables or disables FIPS mode. By default, FIPS mode is not enabled. If FIPS mode is enabled, the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform runs on bypass the default Kubernetes cryptography suite and use the cryptography modules that are provided with RHCOS instead.

[IMPORTANT]
----
When running Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) booted in FIPS mode, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform core components use the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures.
----
Optional: provide the sshKey value that you use to access the machines in your cluster.

[NOTE]
----
For production Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your ssh-agent process uses.
----

## Configuring the cluster-wide proxy during installation

Production environments can deny direct access to the internet and instead have
an HTTP or HTTPS proxy available. You can configure a new Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
cluster to use a proxy by configuring the proxy settings in the
install-config.yaml file.

* You have an existing install-config.yaml file.
* You reviewed the sites that your cluster requires access to and determined whether any of them need to bypass the proxy. By default, all cluster egress traffic is proxied, including calls to hosting cloud provider APIs. You added sites to the Proxy object's spec.noProxy field to bypass the proxy if necessary.

[NOTE]
----
The Proxy object status.noProxy field is populated with the values of the networking.machineNetwork[].cidr, networking.clusterNetwork[].cidr, and networking.serviceNetwork[] fields from your installation configuration.
For installations on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, and Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP), the Proxy object status.noProxy field is also populated with the instance metadata endpoint (169.254.169.254).
----

1. Edit your install-config.yaml file and add the proxy settings. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: my.domain.com
proxy:
  httpProxy: http://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port> 1
  httpsProxy: https://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port> 2
  noProxy: example.com 3
additionalTrustBundle: | 4
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    <MY_TRUSTED_CA_CERT>
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
additionalTrustBundlePolicy: <policy_to_add_additionalTrustBundle> 5
```

A proxy URL to use for creating HTTP connections outside the cluster. The
URL scheme must be http.
A proxy URL to use for creating HTTPS connections outside the cluster.
A comma-separated list of destination domain names, IP addresses, or other network CIDRs to exclude from proxying. Preface a domain with . to match subdomains only. For example, .y.com matches x.y.com, but not y.com. Use * to bypass the proxy for all destinations.
If provided, the installation program generates a config map that is named user-ca-bundle in
the openshift-config namespace that contains one or more additional CA
certificates that are required for proxying HTTPS connections. The Cluster Network
Operator then creates a trusted-ca-bundle config map that merges these contents
with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) trust bundle, and this config map is referenced in the trustedCA field of the Proxy object. The additionalTrustBundle field is required unless
the proxy's identity certificate is signed by an authority from the RHCOS trust
bundle.
Optional: The policy to determine the configuration of the Proxy object to reference the user-ca-bundle config map in the trustedCA field. The allowed values are Proxyonly and Always. Use Proxyonly to reference the user-ca-bundle config map only when http/https proxy is configured. Use Always to always reference the user-ca-bundle config map. The default value is Proxyonly.

[NOTE]
----
The installation program does not support the proxy readinessEndpoints field.
----

[NOTE]
----
If the installer times out, restart and then complete the deployment by using the wait-for command of the installer. For example:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install wait-for install-complete --log-level debug
```

----
2. Save the file and reference it when installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

The installation program creates a cluster-wide proxy that is named cluster that uses the proxy
settings in the provided install-config.yaml file. If no proxy settings are
provided, a cluster Proxy object is still created, but it will have a nil
spec.


[NOTE]
----
Only the Proxy object named cluster is supported, and no additional
proxies can be created.
----

# Manually creating IAM

Installing the cluster requires that the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) operate in manual mode. While the installation program configures the CCO for manual mode, you must specify the identity and access management secrets for you cloud provider.

You can use the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) utility (ccoctl) to create the required IBM Cloud&#174; resources.

* You have configured the ccoctl binary.
* You have an existing install-config.yaml file.

1. Edit the install-config.yaml configuration file so that the file includes the credentialsMode parameter set to Manual.
Example install-config.yaml configuration file

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: cluster1.example.com
credentialsMode: Manual
compute:
- architecture: amd64
  hyperthreading: Enabled
```

* credentialsMode: Set the credentialsMode parameter to Manual.
2. To generate the manifests, run the following command from the directory that includes the installation program:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory>
```

3. From the directory that includes the installation program, set a $RELEASE_IMAGE variable with the release image from your installation file by running the following command:

```terminal
$ RELEASE_IMAGE=$(./openshift-install version | awk '/release image/ {print $3}')
```

4. Extract the list of CredentialsRequest custom resources (CRs) from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc adm release extract \
  --from=$RELEASE_IMAGE \
  --credentials-requests \
  --included \
  --install-config=<path_to_directory_with_installation_configuration>/install-config.yaml \
  --to=<path_to_directory_for_credentials_requests>
```

* --included: Includes only the manifests that your specific cluster configuration requires.
* <path_to_directory_with_installation_configuration>: Specify the location of the install-config.yaml file.
* <path_to_directory_for_credentials_requests>: Specify the path to the directory where you want to store the CredentialsRequest objects. If the specified directory does not exist, this command creates it.

This command creates a YAML file for each CredentialsRequest object.
Sample CredentialsRequest object

```yaml
  apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
  kind: CredentialsRequest
  metadata:
    labels:
      controller-tools.k8s.io: "1.0"
    name: openshift-image-registry-ibmcos
    namespace: openshift-cloud-credential-operator
  spec:
    secretRef:
      name: installer-cloud-credentials
      namespace: openshift-image-registry
    providerSpec:
      apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
      kind: IBMCloudProviderSpec
      policies:
      - attributes:
        - name: serviceName
          value: cloud-object-storage
        roles:
        - crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:Viewer
        - crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:Operator
        - crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:Editor
        - crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::serviceRole:Reader
        - crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::serviceRole:Writer
      - attributes:
        - name: resourceType
          value: resource-group
        roles:
        - crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:Viewer
```

5. Create the service ID for each credential request, assign the policies defined, create an API key, and generate the secret:

```terminal
$ ccoctl ibmcloud create-service-id \
  --credentials-requests-dir=<path_to_credential_requests_directory> \
  --name=<cluster_name> \
  --output-dir=<installation_directory> \
  --resource-group-name=<resource_group_name>
```

* <path_to_credential_requests_directory>: Specify the directory containing the files for the CredentialsRequest objects.
* <cluster_name>: Specify the name of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* <installation_directory>: Optional parameter. Specify the directory in which you want the ccoctl utility to create objects. By default, the utility creates objects in the directory in which you run the commands.
* <resource_group_name>: Optional parameter. Specify the name of the resource group used for scoping the access policies.

[NOTE]
----
If you enabled Technology Preview features by using the TechPreviewNoUpgrade feature set for your cluster, you must include the --enable-tech-preview parameter in the configuration for the CredentialsRequest object.
If you provided a wrong resource group name, the installation fails during the bootstrap phase. To find the correct resource group name, run the following command:

```terminal
$ grep resourceGroupName <installation_directory>/manifests/cluster-infrastructure-02-config.yml
```

----

* Check that the appropriate secrets exist in the manifests directory of your cluster.

# Deploying the cluster

You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on a compatible cloud platform.


[IMPORTANT]
----
You can run the create cluster command of the installation program only once, during initial installation.
----

* You have configured an account with the cloud platform that hosts your cluster.
* You have the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.
* You have verified that the cloud provider account on your host has the correct permissions to deploy the cluster. An account with incorrect permissions causes the installation process to fail with an error message that displays the missing permissions.

* Change to the directory that contains the installation program and initialize the cluster deployment:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install create cluster --dir <installation_directory> \ 1
    --log-level=info 2
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the
location of your customized ./install-config.yaml file.
To view different installation details, specify warn, debug, or
error instead of info.

When the cluster deployment completes successfully:

* The terminal displays directions for accessing your cluster, including a link to the web console and credentials for the kubeadmin user.
* Credential information also outputs to <installation_directory>/.openshift_install.log.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not delete the installation program or the files that the installation program creates. Both are required to delete the cluster.
----


```terminal
...
INFO Install complete!
INFO To access the cluster as the system:admin user when using 'oc', run 'export KUBECONFIG=/home/myuser/install_dir/auth/kubeconfig'
INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.mycluster.example.com
INFO Login to the console with user: "kubeadmin", and password: "password"
INFO Time elapsed: 36m22s
```



[IMPORTANT]
----
* The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending node-bootstrapper certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for Recovering from expired control plane certificates for more information.
* It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.

# Installing the OpenShift CLI on macOS

To manage your cluster and deploy applications from the command line, install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) binary on macOS.


[IMPORTANT]
----
If you installed an earlier version of oc, you cannot use it to complete all of the commands in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
Download and install the new version of oc.
----

1. Navigate to the Download Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform page on the Red Hat Customer Portal.
2. Select the architecture from the Product Variant list.
3. Select the appropriate version from the Version list.
4. Click Download Now next to the OpenShift v4.16 macOS Clients entry and save the file.

[NOTE]
----
For macOS arm64, choose the OpenShift v4.16 macOS arm64 Client entry.
----
5. Unpack and unzip the archive.
6. Move the oc binary to a directory on your PATH variable.

To check your PATH variable, open a terminal and execute the following command:

```terminal
$ echo $PATH
```


* Verify your installation by using an oc command:

```terminal
$ oc <command>
```


# Logging in to the cluster by using the CLI

You can log in to your cluster as a default system user by exporting the cluster kubeconfig file.
The kubeconfig file contains information about the cluster that is used by the CLI to connect a client to the correct cluster and API server.
The file is specific to a cluster and is created during Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation.

* You deployed an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* You installed the oc CLI.

1. Export the kubeadmin credentials:

```terminal
$ export KUBECONFIG=<installation_directory>/auth/kubeconfig 1
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the path to the directory that you stored
the installation files in.
2. Verify you can run oc commands successfully using the exported configuration:

```terminal
$ oc whoami
```

Example output

```terminal
system:admin
```


* Accessing the web console

# Telemetry access for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, the Telemetry service, which runs by default to provide metrics about cluster health and the success of updates, requires internet access. If your cluster is connected to the internet, Telemetry runs automatically, and your cluster is registered to https://console.redhat.com/openshift [OpenShift Cluster Manager].

After you confirm that your https://console.redhat.com/openshift [OpenShift Cluster Manager] inventory is correct, either maintained automatically by Telemetry or manually by using OpenShift Cluster Manager, use subscription watch to track your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform subscriptions at the account or multi-cluster level.
