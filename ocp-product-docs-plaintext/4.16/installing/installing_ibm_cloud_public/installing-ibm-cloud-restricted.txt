Installing a cluster on IBM Cloud in a restricted network

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, you can install a cluster in a restricted network by creating an internal mirror of the installation release content that is accessible to an existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on IBM Cloud(R).
Prerequisites
You reviewed details about the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation and update processes.

You configured an IBM Cloud account to host the cluster.

You have a container image registry that is accessible to the internet and your restricted network. The container image registry should mirror the contents of the OpenShift image registry and contain the installation media. For more information, see Mirroring images for a disconnected installation using the oc-mirror plugin.

You have an existing VPC on IBM Cloud(R) that meets the following requirements:

If you plan on configuring endpoint gateways to use IBM Cloud(R) Virtual Private Endpoints, consider the following requirements:

If you use a firewall, you configured it to allow the sites that your cluster requires access to.

You configured the ccoctl utility before you installed the cluster. For more information, see Configuring IAM for IBM Cloud VPC.
About installations in restricted networks
In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, you can perform an installation that does not require an active connection to the internet to obtain software components. Restricted network installations can be completed using installer-provisioned infrastructure or user-provisioned infrastructure, depending on the cloud platform to which you are installing the cluster.

Required internet access and an installation host
You complete the installation using a bastion host or portable device that can access both the internet and your closed network. You must use a host with internet access to:

Download the installation program, the OpenShift CLI (oc), and the CCO utility (ccoctl).

Use the installation program to locate the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) image and create the installation configuration file.

Use oc to extract ccoctl from the CCO container image.

Use oc and ccoctl to configure IAM for IBM Cloud(R).
Access to a mirror registry
To complete a restricted network installation, you must create a registry that mirrors the contents of the OpenShift image registry and contains the installation media.

You can create this registry on a mirror host, which can access both the internet and your restricted network, or by using other methods that meet your organization's security restrictions.

For more information on mirroring images for a disconnected installation, see "Additional resources".
Access to IBM service endpoints
The installation program requires access to the following IBM Cloud(R) service endpoints:

Cloud Object Storage

DNS Services

Global Search

Global Tagging

Identity Services

Resource Controller

Resource Manager

VPC


If you are specifying an IBM(R) Key Protect for IBM Cloud(R) root key as part of the installation process, the service endpoint for Key Protect is also required.
By default, the public endpoint is used to access the service. If network restrictions limit access to public service endpoints, you can override the default behavior.

Before deploying the cluster, you can update the installation configuration file (install-config.yaml) to specify the URI of an alternate service endpoint. For more information on usage, see "Additional resources".
Additional limits
Clusters in restricted networks have the following additional limitations and restrictions:

The ClusterVersion status includes an Unable to retrieve available updates
error.

By default, you cannot use the contents of the Developer Catalog because
you cannot access the required image stream tags.

Additional IBM Cloud configuration parameters
About using a custom VPC
In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, you can deploy a cluster into the subnets of an existing IBM(R) Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Deploying Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform into an existing VPC can help you avoid limit constraints in new accounts or more easily abide by the operational constraints that your company's guidelines set. If you cannot obtain the infrastructure creation permissions that are required to create the VPC yourself, use this installation option.

Because the installation program cannot know what other components are in your existing subnets, it cannot choose subnet CIDRs and so forth. You must configure networking for the subnets to which you will install the cluster.

Requirements for using your VPC
You must correctly configure the existing VPC and its subnets before you install the cluster. The installation program does not create the following components:

NAT gateways

Subnets

Route tables

VPC network


The installation program cannot:

Subdivide network ranges for the cluster to use

Set route tables for the subnets

Set VPC options like DHCP


The installation program requires that you use the cloud-provided DNS server. Using a custom DNS server is not supported and causes the installation to fail.
VPC validation
The VPC and all of the subnets must be in an existing resource group. The cluster is deployed to the existing VPC.

As part of the installation, specify the following in the install-config.yaml file:

The name of the existing resource group that contains the VPC and subnets (networkResourceGroupName)

The name of the existing VPC (vpcName)

The subnets that were created for control plane machines and compute machines (controlPlaneSubnets and computeSubnets)


Additional installer-provisioned cluster resources are deployed to a separate resource group (resourceGroupName). You can specify this resource group before installing the cluster. If undefined, a new resource group is created for the cluster.
To ensure that the subnets that you provide are suitable, the installation program confirms the following:

All of the subnets that you specify exist.

For each availability zone in the region, you specify:

The machine CIDR that you specified contains the subnets for the compute machines and control plane machines.


Subnet IDs are not supported.
Isolation between clusters
If you deploy Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform to an existing network, the isolation of cluster services is reduced in the following ways:

You can install multiple Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters in the same VPC.

ICMP ingress is allowed to the entire network.

TCP port 22 ingress (SSH) is allowed to the entire network.

Control plane TCP 6443 ingress (Kubernetes API) is allowed to the entire network.

Control plane TCP 22623 ingress (MCS) is allowed to the entire network.
Allowing endpoint gateway traffic
If you are using IBM Cloud(R) Virtual Private endpoints, your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) must be configured to allow traffic to and from the endpoint gateways.

A VPC's default security group is configured to allow all outbound traffic to endpoint gateways. Therefore, the simplest way to allow traffic between your VPC and endpoint gateways is to modify the default security group to allow inbound traffic on port 443.

If you choose to configure a new security group, the security group must be configured to allow both inbound and outbound traffic.
You have installed the IBM Cloud(R) Command Line Interface utility (ibmcloud).


Obtain the identifier for the default security group by running the following command:

Add a rule that allows inbound traffic on port 443 by running the following command:


Be sure that your endpoint gateways are configured to use this security group.
Generating a key pair for cluster node SSH access
During an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation, you can provide an SSH public key to the installation program. The key is passed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) nodes through their Ignition config files and is used to authenticate SSH access to the nodes. The key is added to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys list for the core user on each node, which enables password-less authentication.

After the key is passed to the nodes, you can use the key pair to SSH in to the RHCOS nodes as the user core. To access the nodes through SSH, the private key identity must be managed by SSH for your local user.

If you want to SSH in to your cluster nodes to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, you must provide the SSH public key during the installation process. The ./openshift-install gather command also requires the SSH public key to be in place on the cluster nodes.

Do not skip this procedure in production environments, where disaster recovery and debugging is required.
You must use a local key, not one that you configured with platform-specific approaches such as AWS key pairs.
If you do not have an existing SSH key pair on your local machine to use for authentication onto your cluster nodes, create one. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

View the public SSH key:

Add the SSH private key identity to the SSH agent for your local user, if it has not already been added. SSH agent management of the key is required for password-less SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes, or if you want to use the ./openshift-install gather command.

Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent:


When you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, provide the SSH public key to the installation program.
Exporting the API key
You must set the API key you created as a global variable; the installation program ingests the variable during startup to set the API key.

You have created either a user API key or service ID API key for your IBM Cloud(R) account.


Export your API key for your account as a global variable:


You must set the variable name exactly as specified; the installation program expects the variable name to be present during startup.
Downloading the RHCOS cluster image
The installation program requires the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) image to install the cluster. While optional, downloading the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) before deploying removes the need for internet access when creating the cluster.

Use the installation program to locate and download the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) image.

The host running the installation program has internet access.


Change to the directory that contains the installation program and run the following command:

Use the output of the command to find the location of the IBM Cloud(R) image.

Download and extract the image archive. Make the image available on the host that the installation program uses to create the cluster.
Manually creating the installation configuration file
Installing the cluster requires that you manually create the installation configuration file.

You have obtained the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your
cluster.

You have the imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml file that was created when you mirrored your registry.

You have obtained the contents of the certificate for your mirror registry.


Create an installation directory to store your required installation assets in:

Customize the sample install-config.yaml file template that is provided and save
it in the <installation_directory>.

Back up the install-config.yaml file so that you can use it to install multiple clusters.


Installation configuration parameters for IBM Cloud(R)


Minimum resource requirements for cluster installation
Each cluster machine must meet the following minimum requirements:



As of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.13, RHCOS is based on RHEL version 9.2, which updates the micro-architecture requirements. The following list contains the minimum instruction set architectures (ISA) that each architecture requires:

x86-64 architecture requires x86-64-v2 ISA

ARM64 architecture requires ARMv8.0-A ISA

IBM Power architecture requires Power 9 ISA

s390x architecture requires z14 ISA


For more information, see RHEL Architectures.
If an instance type for your platform meets the minimum requirements for cluster machines, it is supported to use in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
Sample customized install-config.yaml file for IBM Cloud
You can customize the install-config.yaml file to specify more details about your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster's platform or modify the values of the required parameters.

This sample YAML file is provided for reference only. You must obtain your install-config.yaml file by using the installation program and then modify it.

Required.

If you do not provide these parameters and values, the installation program provides the default value.

The controlPlane section is a single mapping, but the compute section is a sequence of mappings. To meet the requirements of the different data structures, the first line of the compute section must begin with a hyphen, -, and the first line of the controlPlane section must not. Only one control plane pool is used.

Enables or disables simultaneous multithreading, also known as Hyper-Threading. By default, simultaneous multithreading is enabled to increase the performance of your machines' cores. You can disable it by setting the parameter value to Disabled. If you disable simultaneous multithreading in some cluster machines, you must disable it in all cluster machines.

The machine CIDR must contain the subnets for the compute machines and control plane machines.

The CIDR must contain the subnets defined in platform.ibmcloud.controlPlaneSubnets and platform.ibmcloud.computeSubnets.

The cluster network plugin to install. The default value OVNKubernetes is the only supported value.

The name of an existing resource group. All installer-provisioned cluster resources are deployed to this resource group. If undefined, a new resource group is created for the cluster.

Based on the network restrictions of the VPC, specify alternate service endpoints as needed. This overrides the default public endpoint for the service.

Specify the name of the resource group that contains the existing virtual private cloud (VPC). The existing VPC and subnets should be in this resource group. The cluster will be installed to this VPC.

Specify the name of an existing VPC.

Specify the name of the existing subnets to which to deploy the control plane machines. The subnets must belong to the VPC that you specified. Specify a subnet for each availability zone in the region.

Specify the name of the existing subnets to which to deploy the compute machines. The subnets must belong to the VPC that you specified. Specify a subnet for each availability zone in the region.

For <local_registry>, specify the registry domain name, and optionally the port, that your mirror registry uses to serve content. For example, registry.example.com or registry.example.com:5000. For <credentials>, specify the base64-encoded user name and password for your mirror registry.

Enables or disables FIPS mode. By default, FIPS mode is not enabled. If FIPS mode is enabled, the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform runs on bypass the default Kubernetes cryptography suite and use the cryptography modules that are provided with RHCOS instead.

Optional: provide the sshKey value that you use to access the machines in your cluster.

Provide the contents of the certificate file that you used for your mirror registry.

Provide these values from the metadata.name: release-0 section of the imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml file that was created when you mirrored the registry.
Configuring the cluster-wide proxy during installation
Production environments can deny direct access to the internet and instead have an HTTP or HTTPS proxy available. You can configure a new Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster to use a proxy by configuring the proxy settings in the install-config.yaml file.

You have an existing install-config.yaml file.

You reviewed the sites that your cluster requires access to and determined whether any of them need to bypass the proxy. By default, all cluster egress traffic is proxied, including calls to hosting cloud provider APIs. You added sites to the Proxy object's spec.noProxy field to bypass the proxy if necessary.


Edit your install-config.yaml file and add the proxy settings. For example:

Save the file and reference it when installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.


The installation program creates a cluster-wide proxy that is named cluster that uses the proxy settings in the provided install-config.yaml file. If no proxy settings are provided, a cluster Proxy object is still created, but it will have a nil spec.

Only the Proxy object named cluster is supported, and no additional proxies can be created.
Installing the OpenShift CLI
You can install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) to interact with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform from a command-line interface. You can install oc on Linux, Windows, or macOS.

If you installed an earlier version of oc, you cannot use it to complete all of the commands in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16. Download and install the new version of oc.

You can install the OpenShift CLI (oc) binary on Linux by using the following procedure.

Navigate to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform downloads page on the Red Hat Customer Portal.

Select the architecture from the Product Variant drop-down list.

Select the appropriate version from the Version drop-down list.

Click Download Now next to the OpenShift v4.16 Linux Client entry and save the file.

Unpack the archive:

Place the oc binary in a directory that is on your PATH.


After you install the OpenShift CLI, it is available using the oc command:



You can install the OpenShift CLI (oc) binary on Windows by using the following procedure.

Navigate to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform downloads page on the Red Hat Customer Portal.

Select the appropriate version from the Version drop-down list.

Click Download Now next to the OpenShift v4.16 Windows Client entry and save the file.

Unzip the archive with a ZIP program.

Move the oc binary to a directory that is on your PATH.


After you install the OpenShift CLI, it is available using the oc command:



You can install the OpenShift CLI (oc) binary on macOS by using the following procedure.

Navigate to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform downloads page on the Red Hat Customer Portal.

Select the appropriate version from the Version drop-down list.

Click Download Now next to the OpenShift v4.16 macOS Client entry and save the file.

Unpack and unzip the archive.

Move the oc binary to a directory on your PATH.


After you install the OpenShift CLI, it is available using the oc command:
Manually creating IAM
Installing the cluster requires that the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) operate in manual mode. While the installation program configures the CCO for manual mode, you must specify the identity and access management secrets for you cloud provider.

You can use the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) utility (ccoctl) to create the required IBM Cloud(R) resources.

You have configured the ccoctl binary.

You have an existing install-config.yaml file.


Edit the install-config.yaml configuration file so that it contains the credentialsMode parameter set to Manual.

To generate the manifests, run the following command from the directory that contains the installation program:

From the directory that contains the installation program, set a $RELEASE_IMAGE variable with the release image from your installation file by running the following command:

Extract the list of CredentialsRequest custom resources (CRs) from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:

Create the service ID for each credential request, assign the policies defined, create an API key, and generate the secret:


Ensure that the appropriate secrets were generated in your cluster's manifests directory.
Deploying the cluster
You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on a compatible cloud platform.

You can run the create cluster command of the installation program only once, during initial installation.
You have configured an account with the cloud platform that hosts your cluster.

You have the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.

You have verified that the cloud provider account on your host has the correct permissions to deploy the cluster. An account with incorrect permissions causes the installation process to fail with an error message that displays the missing permissions.


Export the OPENSHIFT_INSTALL_OS_IMAGE_OVERRIDE variable to specify the location of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) image by running the following command:

Change to the directory that contains the installation program and initialize the cluster deployment:


When the cluster deployment completes successfully:

The terminal displays directions for accessing your cluster, including a link to the web console and credentials for the kubeadmin user.

Credential information also outputs to <installation_directory>/.openshift_install.log.


Do not delete the installation program or the files that the installation program creates. Both are required to delete the cluster.
...
INFO Install complete!
INFO To access the cluster as the system:admin user when using 'oc', run 'export KUBECONFIG=/home/myuser/install_dir/auth/kubeconfig'
INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.mycluster.example.com
INFO Login to the console with user: "kubeadmin", and password: "password"
INFO Time elapsed: 36m22s
The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending node-bootstrapper certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for Recovering from expired control plane certificates for more information.

It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.
Logging in to the cluster by using the CLI
You can log in to your cluster as a default system user by exporting the cluster kubeconfig file. The kubeconfig file contains information about the cluster that is used by the CLI to connect a client to the correct cluster and API server. The file is specific to a cluster and is created during Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation.

You deployed an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

You installed the oc CLI.


Export the kubeadmin credentials:

Verify you can run oc commands successfully using the exported configuration:


Accessing the web console
Post installation
Complete the following steps to complete the configuration of your cluster.

Disabling the default OperatorHub catalog sources
Operator catalogs that source content provided by Red Hat and community projects are configured for OperatorHub by default during an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation. In a restricted network environment, you must disable the default catalogs as a cluster administrator.

Disable the sources for the default catalogs by adding disableAllDefaultSources: true to the OperatorHub object:


Alternatively, you can use the web console to manage catalog sources. From the Administration -> Cluster Settings -> Configuration -> OperatorHub page, click the Sources tab, where you can create, update, delete, disable, and enable individual sources.
Installing the policy resources into the cluster
Mirroring the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform content using the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI (oc) plugin creates resources, which include catalogSource-certified-operator-index.yaml and imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml.

The ImageContentSourcePolicy resource associates the mirror registry with the source registry and redirects image pull requests from the online registries to the mirror registry.

The CatalogSource resource is used by Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to retrieve information about the available Operators in the mirror registry, which lets users discover and install Operators.


After you install the cluster, you must install these resources into the cluster.

You have mirrored the image set to the registry mirror in the disconnected environment.

You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.


Log in to the OpenShift CLI as a user with the cluster-admin role.

Apply the YAML files from the results directory to the cluster:


Verify that the ImageContentSourcePolicy resources were successfully installed:

Verify that the CatalogSource resources were successfully installed:
Telemetry access for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, the Telemetry service, which runs by default to provide metrics about cluster health and the success of updates, requires internet access. If your cluster is connected to the internet, Telemetry runs automatically, and your cluster is registered to https://console.redhat.com/openshift [OpenShift Cluster Manager].

After you confirm that your https://console.redhat.com/openshift [OpenShift Cluster Manager] inventory is correct, either maintained automatically by Telemetry or manually by using OpenShift Cluster Manager, use subscription watch to track your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform subscriptions at the account or multi-cluster level.
