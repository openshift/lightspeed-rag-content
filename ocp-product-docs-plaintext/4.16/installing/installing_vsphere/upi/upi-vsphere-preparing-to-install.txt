# Preparing to install a cluster using user-provisioned infrastructure


You prepare to install an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on vSphere by completing the following steps:
* Downloading the installation program.

[NOTE]
----
If you are installing in a disconnected environment, you extract the installation program from the mirrored content. For more information, see Mirroring images for a disconnected installation.
----
* Installing the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

[NOTE]
----
If you are installing in a disconnected environment, install oc to the mirror host.
----
* Generating an SSH key pair. You can use this key pair to authenticate into the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster's nodes after it is deployed.
* Preparing the user-provisioned infrastructure.
* Validating DNS resolution.

# Obtaining the installation program

Before you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, download the installation file on
 the host you are using for installation.

* You have a computer that runs Linux or macOS, with at least 1.2 GB of local disk space.

1. Go to the Cluster Type page on the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console. If you have a Red Hat account, log in with your credentials. If you do not, create an account.

[TIP]
----
You can also download the binaries for a specific Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release.
----
2. Select your infrastructure provider from the Run it yourself section of the page.
3. Select your host operating system and architecture from the dropdown menus under OpenShift Installer and click Download Installer.
4. Place the downloaded file in the directory where you want to store the installation configuration files.

[IMPORTANT]
----
* The installation program creates several files on the computer that you use to install your cluster. You must keep the installation program and the files that the installation program creates after you finish installing the cluster. Both of the files are required to delete the cluster.
* Deleting the files created by the installation program does not remove your cluster, even if the cluster failed during installation. To remove your cluster, complete the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform uninstallation procedures for your specific cloud provider.
----
5. Extract the installation program. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

```terminal
$ tar -xvf openshift-install-linux.tar.gz
```

6. Download your installation https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret [pull secret from Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager]. This pull secret allows you to authenticate with the services that are provided by the included authorities, including Quay.io, which serves the container images for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform components.

[TIP]
----
Alternatively, you can retrieve the installation program from the Red Hat Customer Portal, where you can specify a version of the installation program to download.
However, you must have an active subscription to access this page.

```


# Generating a key pair for cluster node SSH access

To enable secure, passwordless SSH access to your cluster nodes, provide an SSH public key during the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation. This ensures that the installation program automatically configures the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) nodes for remote authentication through the core user.

The SSH public key gets added to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys list for the core user on each node. After the key is passed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) nodes through their Ignition config files, you can use the key pair to SSH in to the RHCOS nodes as the user core. To access the nodes through SSH, the private key identity must be managed by SSH for your local user.

If you want to SSH in to your cluster nodes to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, you must provide the SSH public key during the installation process. The ./openshift-install gather command also requires the SSH public key to be in place on the cluster nodes.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not skip this procedure in production environments, where disaster recovery and debugging is required.
----


[NOTE]
----
You must use a local key, not one that you configured with platform-specific
approaches such as
AWS key pairs.
----

1. If you do not have an existing SSH key pair on your local machine to use for authentication onto your cluster nodes, create one. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

```terminal
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N '' -f <path>/<file_name>
```


Specifies the path and file name, such as ~/.ssh/id_ed25519, of the new SSH key. If you have an existing key pair, ensure your public key is in the your ~/.ssh directory.

[NOTE]
----
If you plan to install an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster that uses the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures, do not create a key that uses the ed25519 algorithm. Instead, create a key that uses the rsa or ecdsa algorithm.
----
2. View the public SSH key:

```terminal
$ cat <path>/<file_name>.pub
```


For example, run the following to view the ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub public key:

```terminal
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

3. Add the SSH private key identity to the SSH agent for your local user, if it has not already been added. SSH agent management of the key is required for password-less SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes, or if you want to use the ./openshift-install gather command.

[NOTE]
----
On some distributions, default SSH private key identities such as ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_dsa are managed automatically.
----
1. If the ssh-agent process is not already running for your local user, start it as a background task:

```terminal
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

Example output

```terminal
Agent pid 31874
```


[NOTE]
----
If your cluster is in FIPS mode, only use FIPS-compliant algorithms to generate the SSH key. The key must be either RSA or ECDSA.
----
4. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent:

```terminal
$ ssh-add <path>/<file_name>
```


Specifies the path and file name for your SSH private key, such as ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
Example output

```terminal
Identity added: /home/<you>/<path>/<file_name> (<computer_name>)
```


* When you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, provide the SSH public key to the installation program.
If you install a cluster on infrastructure that you provision, you must provide the key to the installation program.

# Preparing the user-provisioned infrastructure

To ensure a successful deployment and meet cluster requirements in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, prepare your user-provisioned infrastructure before starting the installation. Configuring your compute, network, and storage components in advance provides the stable foundation necessary for the installation program to function correctly.

This section provides details about the high-level steps required to set up your cluster infrastructure in preparation for an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation. This includes configuring IP networking and network connectivity for your cluster nodes,
enabling the required ports through your firewall, and setting up the required DNS and load balancing infrastructure.

After preparation, your cluster infrastructure must meet the requirements outlined in the Requirements for a cluster with user-provisioned infrastructure section.

* You have reviewed the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.x Tested Integrations page.
* You have reviewed the infrastructure requirements detailed in the Requirements for a cluster with user-provisioned infrastructure section.

1. If you are using DHCP to provide the IP networking configuration to your cluster nodes, configure your DHCP service.
1. Add persistent IP addresses for the nodes to your DHCP server configuration. In your configuration, match the MAC address of the relevant network interface to the intended IP address for each node.
2. When you use DHCP to configure IP addressing for the cluster machines, the machines also obtain the DNS server information through DHCP. Define the persistent DNS server address that is used by the cluster nodes through your DHCP server configuration.

[NOTE]
----
If you are not using a DHCP service, you must provide the IP networking configuration and the address of the DNS server to the nodes at RHCOS install time. These can be passed as boot arguments if you are installing from an ISO image. See the Installing RHCOS and starting the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform bootstrap process section for more information about static IP provisioning and advanced networking options.
----
3. Define the hostnames of your cluster nodes in your DHCP server configuration. See the Setting the cluster node hostnames through DHCP section for details about hostname considerations.

[NOTE]
----
If you are not using a DHCP service, the cluster nodes obtain their hostname through a reverse DNS lookup.
----
2. Ensure that your network infrastructure provides the required network connectivity between the cluster components. See the Networking requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure section for details about the requirements.
3. Configure your firewall to enable the ports required for the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster components to communicate. See Networking requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure section for details about the ports that are required.

[IMPORTANT]
----
By default, port 1936 is accessible for an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, because each control plane node needs access to this port.
Avoid using the Ingress load balancer to expose this port, because doing so might result in the exposure of sensitive information, such as statistics and metrics, related to Ingress Controllers.
----
4. Setup the required DNS infrastructure for your cluster.
1. Configure DNS name resolution for the Kubernetes API, the application wildcard, the bootstrap machine, the control plane machines, and the compute machines.
2. Configure reverse DNS resolution for the Kubernetes API, the bootstrap machine, the control plane machines, and the compute machines.

See the User-provisioned DNS requirements section for more information about the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform DNS requirements.
5. Validate your DNS configuration.
1. From your installation node, run DNS lookups against the record names of the Kubernetes API, the wildcard routes, and the cluster nodes. Validate that the IP addresses in the responses correspond to the correct components.
2. From your installation node, run reverse DNS lookups against the IP addresses of the load balancer and the cluster nodes. Validate that the record names in the responses correspond to the correct components.

See the Validating DNS resolution for user-provisioned infrastructure section for detailed DNS validation steps.
6. Provision the required API and application ingress load balancing infrastructure. See the Load balancing requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure section for more information about the requirements.

[NOTE]
----
Some load balancing solutions require the DNS name resolution for the cluster nodes to be in place before the load balancing is initialized.
----

## Example load balancer configuration for user-provisioned clusters

Reference the example API and application Ingress load balancer configuration so that you can understand how to meet the load balancing requirements for user-provisioned clusters.

The sample is an /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg configuration for an HAProxy load balancer. The example is not meant to provide advice for choosing one load balancing solution over another.


[TIP]
----
If you are using HAProxy as a load balancer, you can check that the haproxy process is listening on ports 6443, 22623, 443, and 80 by running netstat -nltupe on the HAProxy node.
----

In the example, the same load balancer is used for the Kubernetes API and application ingress traffic. In production scenarios, you can deploy the API and application ingress load balancers separately so that you can scale the load balancer infrastructure for each in isolation.


[NOTE]
----
If you are using HAProxy as a load balancer and SELinux is set to enforcing, you must ensure that the HAProxy service can bind to the configured TCP port by running setsebool -P haproxy_connect_any=1.

[NOTE]
----
If you are deploying a three-node cluster with zero compute nodes, the Ingress Controller pods run on the control plane nodes. In three-node cluster deployments, you must configure your application Ingress load balancer to route HTTP and HTTPS traffic to the control plane nodes.

# Validating DNS resolution for user-provisioned infrastructure

To prevent network-related installation failures and ensure node connectivity in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, validate your DNS configuration before deploying on user-provisioned infrastructure. This verification confirms that all required records resolve correctly, providing the stable foundation necessary for cluster communication.


[IMPORTANT]
----
The validation steps detailed in this section must succeed before you install your cluster.
----

* You have configured the required DNS records for your user-provisioned infrastructure.

1. From your installation node, run DNS lookups against the record names of the Kubernetes API, the wildcard routes, and the cluster nodes. Validate that the IP addresses contained in the responses correspond to the correct components.
1. Perform a lookup against the Kubernetes API record name. Check that the result points to the IP address of the API load balancer:

```terminal
$ dig +noall +answer @<nameserver_ip> api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
```


Replace <nameserver_ip> with the IP address of the name server, <cluster_name> with your cluster name, and <base_domain> with your base domain name.
Example output

```terminal
api.ocp4.example.com.		604800	IN	A	192.168.1.5
```

2. Perform a lookup against the Kubernetes internal API record name. Check that the result points to the IP address of the API load balancer:

```terminal
$ dig +noall +answer @<nameserver_ip> api-int.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
```

Example output

```terminal
api-int.ocp4.example.com.		604800	IN	A	192.168.1.5
```

3. Test an example *.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain> DNS wildcard lookup. All of the application wildcard lookups must resolve to the IP address of the application ingress load balancer:

```terminal
$ dig +noall +answer @<nameserver_ip> random.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
```

Example output

```terminal
random.apps.ocp4.example.com.		604800	IN	A	192.168.1.5
```


[NOTE]
----
In the example outputs, the same load balancer is used for the Kubernetes API and application ingress traffic. In production scenarios, you can deploy the API and application ingress load balancers separately so that you can scale the load balancer infrastructure for each in isolation.
----

You can replace random with another wildcard value. For example, you can query the route to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform console:

```terminal
$ dig +noall +answer @<nameserver_ip> console-openshift-console.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
```

Example output

```terminal
console-openshift-console.apps.ocp4.example.com. 604800 IN	A 192.168.1.5
```

4. Run a lookup against the bootstrap DNS record name. Check that the result points to the IP address of the bootstrap node:

```terminal
$ dig +noall +answer @<nameserver_ip> bootstrap.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
```

Example output

```terminal
bootstrap.ocp4.example.com.		604800	IN	A	192.168.1.96
```

5. Use this method to perform lookups against the DNS record names for the control plane and compute nodes. Check that the results correspond to the IP addresses of each node.
2. From your installation node, run reverse DNS lookups against the IP addresses of the load balancer and the cluster nodes. Validate that the record names contained in the responses correspond to the correct components.
1. Perform a reverse lookup against the IP address of the API load balancer. Check that the response includes the record names for the Kubernetes API and the Kubernetes internal API:

```terminal
$ dig +noall +answer @<nameserver_ip> -x 192.168.1.5
```

Example output

```terminal
5.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa. 604800	IN	PTR	api-int.ocp4.example.com.
5.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa. 604800	IN	PTR	api.ocp4.example.com.
```


where:
api-int.ocp4.example.com:: Specifies the record name for the Kubernetes internal API.
api.ocp4.example.com:: Specifies the record name for the Kubernetes API.

[NOTE]
----
A PTR record is not required for the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform application wildcard. No validation step is needed for reverse DNS resolution against the IP address of the application ingress load balancer.
----
2. Perform a reverse lookup against the IP address of the bootstrap node. Check that the result points to the DNS record name of the bootstrap node:

```terminal
$ dig +noall +answer @<nameserver_ip> -x 192.168.1.96
```

Example output

```terminal
96.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa. 604800	IN	PTR	bootstrap.ocp4.example.com.
```

3. Use this method to perform reverse lookups against the IP addresses for the control plane and compute nodes. Check that the results correspond to the DNS record names of each node.
