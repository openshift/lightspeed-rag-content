# Installing a cluster quickly on GCP


In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.16, you can install a cluster on
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that uses the default configuration options.

# Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation and update processes.
* You read the documentation on selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users.
* You configured a GCP project to host the cluster.
* If you use a firewall, you configured it to allow the sites that your cluster requires access to.

# Internet access for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, you require access to the internet to
install
your cluster.

You must have internet access to:

* Access https://console.redhat.com/openshift [OpenShift Cluster Manager] to download the installation program and perform subscription management. If the cluster has internet access and you do not disable Telemetry, that service automatically entitles your cluster.
* Access Quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install your cluster.
* Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.

# Generating a key pair for cluster node SSH access

During an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation, you can provide an SSH public key to the installation program. The key is passed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) nodes through their Ignition config files and is used to authenticate SSH access to the nodes. The key is added to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys list for the core user on each node, which enables password-less authentication.

After the key is passed to the nodes, you can use the key pair to SSH in to the RHCOS nodes as the user core. To access the nodes through SSH, the private key identity must be managed by SSH for your local user.

If you want to SSH in to your cluster nodes to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, you must provide the SSH public key during the installation process. The ./openshift-install gather command also requires the SSH public key to be in place on the cluster nodes.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not skip this procedure in production environments, where disaster recovery and debugging is required.
----


[NOTE]
----
You must use a local key, not one that you configured with platform-specific
approaches such as
AWS key pairs.
----

1. If you do not have an existing SSH key pair on your local machine to use for authentication onto your cluster nodes, create one. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

```terminal
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N '' -f <path>/<file_name> 1
```

Specify the path and file name, such as ~/.ssh/id_ed25519, of the new SSH key. If you have an existing key pair, ensure your public key is in the your ~/.ssh directory.

[NOTE]
----
If you plan to install an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster that uses the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures, do not create a key that uses the ed25519 algorithm. Instead, create a key that uses the rsa or ecdsa algorithm.
----
2. View the public SSH key:

```terminal
$ cat <path>/<file_name>.pub
```


For example, run the following to view the ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub public key:

```terminal
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

3. Add the SSH private key identity to the SSH agent for your local user, if it has not already been added. SSH agent management of the key is required for password-less SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes, or if you want to use the ./openshift-install gather command.

[NOTE]
----
On some distributions, default SSH private key identities such as ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_dsa are managed automatically.
----
1. If the ssh-agent process is not already running for your local user, start it as a background task:

```terminal
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

Example output

```terminal
Agent pid 31874
```


[NOTE]
----
If your cluster is in FIPS mode, only use FIPS-compliant algorithms to generate the SSH key. The key must be either RSA or ECDSA.
----
4. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent:

```terminal
$ ssh-add <path>/<file_name> 1
```

Specify the path and file name for your SSH private key, such as ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
Example output

```terminal
Identity added: /home/<you>/<path>/<file_name> (<computer_name>)
```


* When you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, provide the SSH public key to the installation program.

# Obtaining the installation program

Before you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, download the installation file on
 the host you are using for installation.

* You have a computer that runs Linux or macOS, with at least 1.2 GB of local disk space.

1. Go to the Cluster Type page on the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console. If you have a Red Hat account, log in with your credentials. If you do not, create an account.
2. Select your infrastructure provider from the Run it yourself section of the page.
3. Select your host operating system and architecture from the dropdown menus under OpenShift Installer and click Download Installer.
4. Place the downloaded file in the directory where you want to store the installation configuration files.

[IMPORTANT]
----
* The installation program creates several files on the computer that you use to install your cluster. You must keep the installation program and the files that the installation program creates after you finish installing the cluster. Both of the files are required to delete the cluster.
* Deleting the files created by the installation program does not remove your cluster, even if the cluster failed during installation. To remove your cluster, complete the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform uninstallation procedures for your specific cloud provider.
----
5. Extract the installation program. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

```terminal
$ tar -xvf openshift-install-linux.tar.gz
```

6. Download your installation https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret [pull secret from Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager]. This pull secret allows you to authenticate with the services that are provided by the included authorities, including Quay.io, which serves the container images for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform components.


[TIP]
----
Alternatively, you can retrieve the installation program from the Red Hat Customer Portal, where you can specify a version of the installation program to download.
However, you must have an active subscription to access this page.
----

# Deploying the cluster

You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on a compatible cloud platform.


[IMPORTANT]
----
You can run the create cluster command of the installation program only once, during initial installation.
----

* You have configured an account with the cloud platform that hosts your cluster.
* You have the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.
* You have verified that the cloud provider account on your host has the correct permissions to deploy the cluster. An account with incorrect permissions causes the installation process to fail with an error message that displays the missing permissions.

1. Remove any existing GCP credentials that do not use the service account key
for the GCP account that you configured for your cluster and that are stored in the
following locations:
* The GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS, GOOGLE_CLOUD_KEYFILE_JSON, or GCLOUD_KEYFILE_JSON
environment variables
* The ~/.gcp/osServiceAccount.json file
* The gcloud cli default credentials
2. Change to the directory that contains the installation program and initialize the cluster deployment:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install create cluster --dir <installation_directory> \ 1
    --log-level=info 2
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the
directory name to store the files that the installation program creates.
To view different installation details, specify warn, debug, or
error instead of info.

When specifying the directory:
* Verify that the directory has the execute permission. This permission is required to run Terraform binaries under the installation directory.
* Use an empty directory. Some installation assets, such as bootstrap X.509 certificates, have short expiration intervals, therefore you must not reuse an installation directory. If you want to reuse individual files from another cluster installation, you can copy them into your directory. However, the file names for the installation assets might change between releases. Use caution when copying installation files from an earlier Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version.
3. Provide values at the prompts:
1. Optional: Select an SSH key to use to access your cluster machines.

[NOTE]
----
For production Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your ssh-agent process uses.
----
2. Select gcp as the platform to target.
3. If you have not configured the service account key for your GCP account on
your host, you must obtain it from GCP and paste the contents of the file
or enter the absolute path to the file.
4. Select the project ID to provision the cluster in. The default value is
specified by the service account that you configured.
5. Select the region to deploy the cluster to.
6. Select the base domain to deploy the cluster to. The base domain corresponds
to the public DNS zone that you created for your cluster.
7. Enter a descriptive name for your cluster.
If you provide a name that is longer
than 6 characters, only the first 6 characters will be used in the infrastructure
ID that is generated from the cluster name.
8. Paste the https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret [pull secret from Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager].
4. Optional: You can reduce the number of permissions for the service account that you used to install the cluster.
* If you assigned the Owner role to your service account, you can remove that role and replace it with the Viewer role.
* If you included the Service Account Key Admin role,
you can remove it.

When the cluster deployment completes successfully:

* The terminal displays directions for accessing your cluster, including a link to the web console and credentials for the kubeadmin user.
* Credential information also outputs to <installation_directory>/.openshift_install.log.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not delete the installation program or the files that the installation program creates. Both are required to delete the cluster.
----


```terminal
...
INFO Install complete!
INFO To access the cluster as the system:admin user when using 'oc', run 'export KUBECONFIG=/home/myuser/install_dir/auth/kubeconfig'
INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.mycluster.example.com
INFO Login to the console with user: "kubeadmin", and password: "password"
INFO Time elapsed: 36m22s
```



[IMPORTANT]
----
* The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending node-bootstrapper certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for Recovering from expired control plane certificates for more information.
* It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.

# Telemetry access for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, the Telemetry service, which runs by default to provide metrics about cluster health and the success of updates, requires internet access. If your cluster is connected to the internet, Telemetry runs automatically, and your cluster is registered to https://console.redhat.com/openshift [OpenShift Cluster Manager].

After you confirm that your https://console.redhat.com/openshift [OpenShift Cluster Manager] inventory is correct, either maintained automatically by Telemetry or manually by using OpenShift Cluster Manager, use subscription watch to track your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform subscriptions at the account or multi-cluster level.

* See About remote health monitoring for more information about the Telemetry service

# Next steps

* Customize your cluster.
* If necessary, you can
opt out of remote health reporting.
