# Installing a private cluster on IBM Power Virtual Server


In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.16, you can install a private cluster into an existing VPC and IBM Power(R) Virtual Server Workspace. The installation program provisions the rest of the required infrastructure, which you can further customize. To customize the installation, you modify parameters in the install-config.yaml file before you install the cluster.

# Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation and update processes.
* You read the documentation on selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users.
* You configured an IBM Cloud(R) account to host the cluster.
* If you use a firewall, you configured it to allow the sites that your cluster requires access to.
* You configured the ccoctl utility before you installed the cluster. For more information, see Configuring the Cloud Credential Operator utility.

# Private clusters

You can deploy a private Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster that does not expose external endpoints. Private clusters are accessible from only an internal network and are not visible to the internet.

By default, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is provisioned to use publicly-accessible DNS and endpoints. A private cluster sets the DNS, Ingress Controller, and API server to private when you deploy your cluster. This means that the cluster resources are only accessible from your internal network and are not visible to the internet.


[IMPORTANT]
----
If the cluster has any public subnets, load balancer services created by administrators might be publicly accessible. To ensure cluster security, verify that these services are explicitly annotated as private.
----

To deploy a private cluster, you must:

* Use existing networking that meets your requirements.
* Create a DNS zone using IBM Cloud(R) DNS Services and specify it as the base domain of the cluster. For more information, see "Using IBM Cloud(R) DNS Services to configure DNS resolution".
* Deploy from a machine that has access to:
* The API services for the cloud to which you provision.
* The hosts on the network that you provision.
* The internet to obtain installation media.

You can use any machine that meets these access requirements and follows your company&#8217;s guidelines. For example, this machine can be a bastion host on your cloud network or a machine that has access to the network through a VPN.

# Private clusters in IBM Power Virtual Server

To create a private cluster on IBM Power&#174; Virtual Server, you must provide an existing private Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and subnets to host the cluster. The installation program must also be able to resolve the DNS records that the cluster requires. The installation program configures the Ingress Operator and API server for only internal traffic.

The cluster still requires access to internet to access the IBM Cloud&#174; APIs.

The following items are not required or created when you install a private cluster:

* Public subnets
* Public network load balancers, which support public Ingress
* A public DNS zone that matches the baseDomain for the cluster

You will also need to create an IBM&#174; DNS service containing a DNS zone that matches your baseDomain. Unlike standard deployments on Power VS which use IBM&#174; CIS for DNS, you must use IBM&#174; DNS for your DNS service.

## Limitations

Private clusters on IBM Power&#174; Virtual Server are subject only to the limitations associated with the existing VPC that was used for cluster deployment.

# Requirements for using your VPC

You must correctly configure the existing VPC and its subnets before you install the cluster. The installation program does not create a VPC or VPC subnet in this scenario.

The installation program cannot:

* Subdivide network ranges for the cluster to use
* Set route tables for the subnets
* Set VPC options like DHCP


[NOTE]
----
The installation program requires that you use the cloud-provided DNS server. Using a custom DNS server is not supported and causes the installation to fail.
----

## VPC validation

The VPC and all of the subnets must be in an existing resource group. The cluster is deployed to this resource group.

As part of the installation, specify the following in the install-config.yaml file:

* The name of the resource group
* The name of VPC
* The name of the VPC subnet

To ensure that the subnets that you provide are suitable, the installation program confirms that all of the subnets you specify exists.


[NOTE]
----
Subnet IDs are not supported.
----

## Isolation between clusters

If you deploy Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform to an existing network, the isolation of cluster services is reduced in the following ways:

* ICMP Ingress is allowed to the entire network.
* TCP port 22 Ingress (SSH) is allowed to the entire network.
* Control plane TCP 6443 Ingress (Kubernetes API) is allowed to the entire network.
* Control plane TCP 22623 Ingress (MCS) is allowed to the entire network.

# Internet access for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, you require access to the internet to
install
your cluster.

You must have internet access to:

* Access https://console.redhat.com/openshift [OpenShift Cluster Manager] to download the installation program and perform subscription management. If the cluster has internet access and you do not disable Telemetry, that service automatically entitles your cluster.
* Access Quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install your cluster.
* Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.

# Generating a key pair for cluster node SSH access

During an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation, you can provide an SSH public key to the installation program. The key is passed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) nodes through their Ignition config files and is used to authenticate SSH access to the nodes. The key is added to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys list for the core user on each node, which enables password-less authentication.

After the key is passed to the nodes, you can use the key pair to SSH in to the RHCOS nodes as the user core. To access the nodes through SSH, the private key identity must be managed by SSH for your local user.

If you want to SSH in to your cluster nodes to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, you must provide the SSH public key during the installation process. The ./openshift-install gather command also requires the SSH public key to be in place on the cluster nodes.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not skip this procedure in production environments, where disaster recovery and debugging is required.
----


[NOTE]
----
You must use a local key, not one that you configured with platform-specific
approaches such as
AWS key pairs.
----

1. If you do not have an existing SSH key pair on your local machine to use for authentication onto your cluster nodes, create one. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

```terminal
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N '' -f <path>/<file_name> 1
```

Specify the path and file name, such as ~/.ssh/id_ed25519, of the new SSH key. If you have an existing key pair, ensure your public key is in the your ~/.ssh directory.
2. View the public SSH key:

```terminal
$ cat <path>/<file_name>.pub
```


For example, run the following to view the ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub public key:

```terminal
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

3. Add the SSH private key identity to the SSH agent for your local user, if it has not already been added. SSH agent management of the key is required for password-less SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes, or if you want to use the ./openshift-install gather command.

[NOTE]
----
On some distributions, default SSH private key identities such as ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_dsa are managed automatically.
----
1. If the ssh-agent process is not already running for your local user, start it as a background task:

```terminal
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

Example output

```terminal
Agent pid 31874
```

4. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent:

```terminal
$ ssh-add <path>/<file_name> 1
```

Specify the path and file name for your SSH private key, such as ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
Example output

```terminal
Identity added: /home/<you>/<path>/<file_name> (<computer_name>)
```


* When you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, provide the SSH public key to the installation program.

# Obtaining the installation program

Before you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, download the installation file on
 the host you are using for installation.

* You have a computer that runs Linux or macOS, with at least 1.2 GB of local disk space.

1. Go to the Cluster Type page on the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console. If you have a Red Hat account, log in with your credentials. If you do not, create an account.
2. Select your infrastructure provider from the Run it yourself section of the page.
3. Select your host operating system and architecture from the dropdown menus under OpenShift Installer and click Download Installer.
4. Place the downloaded file in the directory where you want to store the installation configuration files.

[IMPORTANT]
----
* The installation program creates several files on the computer that you use to install your cluster. You must keep the installation program and the files that the installation program creates after you finish installing the cluster. Both of the files are required to delete the cluster.
* Deleting the files created by the installation program does not remove your cluster, even if the cluster failed during installation. To remove your cluster, complete the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform uninstallation procedures for your specific cloud provider.
----
5. Extract the installation program. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

```terminal
$ tar -xvf openshift-install-linux.tar.gz
```

6. Download your installation https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret [pull secret from Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager]. This pull secret allows you to authenticate with the services that are provided by the included authorities, including Quay.io, which serves the container images for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform components.


[TIP]
----
Alternatively, you can retrieve the installation program from the Red Hat Customer Portal, where you can specify a version of the installation program to download.
However, you must have an active subscription to access this page.
----

# Exporting the API key

You must set the API key you created as a global variable; the installation program ingests the variable during startup to set the API key.

* You have created either a user API key or service ID API key for your IBM Cloud(R) account.

* Export your API key for your account as a global variable:

```terminal
$ export IBMCLOUD_API_KEY=<api_key>
```



[IMPORTANT]
----
You must set the variable name exactly as specified; the installation program expects the variable name to be present during startup.
----

# Manually creating the installation configuration file

Installing the cluster requires that you manually create the installation configuration file.

* You have an SSH public key on your local machine to provide to the installation program. The key will be used for SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes for debugging and disaster recovery.
* You have obtained the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your
cluster.

1. Create an installation directory to store your required installation assets in:

```terminal
$ mkdir <installation_directory>
```


[IMPORTANT]
----
You must create a directory. Some installation assets, like bootstrap X.509
certificates have short expiration intervals, so you must not reuse an
installation directory. If you want to reuse individual files from another
cluster installation, you can copy them into your directory. However, the file
names for the installation assets might change between releases. Use caution
when copying installation files from an earlier Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version.
----
2. Customize the sample install-config.yaml file template that is provided and save
it in the <installation_directory>.

[NOTE]
----
You must name this configuration file install-config.yaml.
----
3. Back up the install-config.yaml file so that you can use it to install multiple clusters.

[IMPORTANT]
----
The install-config.yaml file is consumed during the next step of the installation process. You must back it up now.
----

* Installation configuration parameters for IBM Power(R) Virtual Server

## Minimum resource requirements for cluster installation

Each cluster machine must meet the following minimum requirements:



1. One vCPU is equivalent to one physical core when simultaneous multithreading (SMT), or Hyper-Threading, is not enabled. When enabled, use the following formula to calculate the corresponding ratio: (threads per core × cores) × sockets = vCPUs.
2. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and Kubernetes are sensitive to disk performance, and faster storage is recommended, particularly for etcd on the control plane nodes. Note that on many cloud platforms, storage size and IOPS scale together, so you might need to over-allocate storage volume to obtain sufficient performance.


[NOTE]
----
As of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.13, RHCOS is based on RHEL version 9.2, which updates the micro-architecture requirements. The following list contains the minimum instruction set architectures (ISA) that each architecture requires:
* x86-64 architecture requires x86-64-v2 ISA
* ARM64 architecture requires ARMv8.0-A ISA
* IBM Power architecture requires Power 9 ISA
* s390x architecture requires z14 ISA
For more information, see RHEL Architectures.
----

If an instance type for your platform meets the minimum requirements for cluster machines, it is supported to use in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

* Optimizing storage

## Sample customized install-config.yaml file for IBM Power Virtual Server

You can customize the install-config.yaml file to specify more details about your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster&#8217;s platform or modify the values of the required parameters.


[IMPORTANT]
----
This sample YAML file is provided for reference only. You must obtain your install-config.yaml file by using the installation program and modify it.
----


```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
compute: 1 2
- architecture: ppc64le
  hyperthreading: Enabled 3
  name: worker
  platform:
    powervs:
      smtLevel: 8 4
  replicas: 3
controlPlane: 1 2
  architecture: ppc64le
  hyperthreading: Enabled 3
  name: master
  platform:
    powervs:
      smtLevel: 8 4

platform:
  powervs:
    userID: ibm-user-id
    powervsResourceGroup: "ibmcloud-resource-group"

    serviceInstanceGUID: "powervs-region-service-instance-guid"
publish: Internal 8
pullSecret: '{"auths": ...}' 9
sshKey: ssh-ed25519 AAAA... 10
```


If you do not provide these parameters and values, the installation program provides the default value.
The controlPlane section is a single mapping, but the compute section is a sequence of mappings. To meet the requirements of the different data structures, the first line of the compute section must begin with a hyphen, -, and the first line of the controlPlane section must not. Both sections currently define a single machine pool. Only one control plane pool is used.
Whether to enable or disable simultaneous multithreading, or hyperthreading. By default, simultaneous multithreading is enabled to increase the performance of your machines' cores. You can disable it by setting the parameter value to Disabled. If you disable simultaneous multithreading in some cluster machines, you must disable it in all cluster machines.
The smtLevel specifies the level of SMT to set to the control plane and compute machines. The supported values are 1, 2, 4, 8, 'off' and 'on'. The default value is 8. The smtLevel 'off' sets SMT to off and smtlevel 'on' sets SMT to the default value 8 on the cluster nodes.

[NOTE]
----
When simultaneous multithreading (SMT), or hyperthreading is not enabled, one vCPU is equivalent to one physical core. When enabled, total vCPUs is computed as (Thread(s) per core * Core(s) per socket) * Socket(s). The smtLevel controls the threads per core. Lower SMT levels may require additional assigned cores when deploying the cluster nodes. You can do this by setting the 'processors' parameter in the install-config.yaml file to an appropriate value to meet the requirements for deploying Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform successfully.
----
The machine CIDR must contain the subnets for the compute machines and control plane machines.
The cluster network plugin to install. The default value OVNKubernetes is the only supported value.
Specify the name of an existing VPC.
Specify how to publish the user-facing endpoints of your cluster. Set publish to Internal to deploy a private cluster.
Required. The installation program prompts you for this value.
Provide the sshKey value that you use to access the machines in your cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
----
If you disable simultaneous multithreading, ensure that your capacity planning accounts for the dramatically decreased machine performance.
----

[NOTE]
----
For production Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your ssh-agent process uses.
----

## Configuring the cluster-wide proxy during installation

Production environments can deny direct access to the internet and instead have
an HTTP or HTTPS proxy available. You can configure a new Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
cluster to use a proxy by configuring the proxy settings in the
install-config.yaml file.

* You have an existing install-config.yaml file.
* You reviewed the sites that your cluster requires access to and determined whether any of them need to bypass the proxy. By default, all cluster egress traffic is proxied, including calls to hosting cloud provider APIs. You added sites to the Proxy object's spec.noProxy field to bypass the proxy if necessary.

[NOTE]
----
The Proxy object status.noProxy field is populated with the values of the networking.machineNetwork[].cidr, networking.clusterNetwork[].cidr, and networking.serviceNetwork[] fields from your installation configuration.
For installations on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, and Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP), the Proxy object status.noProxy field is also populated with the instance metadata endpoint (169.254.169.254).
----

1. Edit your install-config.yaml file and add the proxy settings. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: my.domain.com
proxy:
  httpProxy: http://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port> 1
  httpsProxy: https://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port> 2
  noProxy: example.com 3
additionalTrustBundle: | 4
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    <MY_TRUSTED_CA_CERT>
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
additionalTrustBundlePolicy: <policy_to_add_additionalTrustBundle> 5
```

A proxy URL to use for creating HTTP connections outside the cluster. The
URL scheme must be http.
A proxy URL to use for creating HTTPS connections outside the cluster.
A comma-separated list of destination domain names, IP addresses, or other network CIDRs to exclude from proxying. Preface a domain with . to match subdomains only. For example, .y.com matches x.y.com, but not y.com. Use * to bypass the proxy for all destinations.
If provided, the installation program generates a config map that is named user-ca-bundle in
the openshift-config namespace that contains one or more additional CA
certificates that are required for proxying HTTPS connections. The Cluster Network
Operator then creates a trusted-ca-bundle config map that merges these contents
with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) trust bundle, and this config map is referenced in the trustedCA field of the Proxy object. The additionalTrustBundle field is required unless
the proxy's identity certificate is signed by an authority from the RHCOS trust
bundle.
Optional: The policy to determine the configuration of the Proxy object to reference the user-ca-bundle config map in the trustedCA field. The allowed values are Proxyonly and Always. Use Proxyonly to reference the user-ca-bundle config map only when http/https proxy is configured. Use Always to always reference the user-ca-bundle config map. The default value is Proxyonly.

[NOTE]
----
The installation program does not support the proxy readinessEndpoints field.
----

[NOTE]
----
If the installer times out, restart and then complete the deployment by using the wait-for command of the installer. For example:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install wait-for install-complete --log-level debug
```

----
2. Save the file and reference it when installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

The installation program creates a cluster-wide proxy that is named cluster that uses the proxy
settings in the provided install-config.yaml file. If no proxy settings are
provided, a cluster Proxy object is still created, but it will have a nil
spec.


[NOTE]
----
Only the Proxy object named cluster is supported, and no additional
proxies can be created.
----

# Manually creating IAM

Installing the cluster requires that the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) operate in manual mode. While the installation program configures the CCO for manual mode, you must specify the identity and access management secrets for you cloud provider.

You can use the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) utility (ccoctl) to create the required IBM Cloud&#174; resources.

* You have configured the ccoctl binary.
* You have an existing install-config.yaml file.

1. Edit the install-config.yaml configuration file so that it contains the credentialsMode parameter set to Manual.
Example install-config.yaml configuration file

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: cluster1.example.com
credentialsMode: Manual 1
compute:
- architecture: ppc64le
  hyperthreading: Enabled
```

This line is added to set the credentialsMode parameter to Manual.
2. To generate the manifests, run the following command from the directory that contains the installation program:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory>
```

3. From the directory that contains the installation program, set a $RELEASE_IMAGE variable with the release image from your installation file by running the following command:

```terminal
$ RELEASE_IMAGE=$(./openshift-install version | awk '/release image/ {print $3}')
```

4. Extract the list of CredentialsRequest custom resources (CRs) from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc adm release extract \
  --from=$RELEASE_IMAGE \
  --credentials-requests \
  --included \1
  --install-config=<path_to_directory_with_installation_configuration>/install-config.yaml \2
  --to=<path_to_directory_for_credentials_requests> 3
```

The --included parameter includes only the manifests that your specific cluster configuration requires.
Specify the location of the install-config.yaml file.
Specify the path to the directory where you want to store the CredentialsRequest objects. If the specified directory does not exist, this command creates it.

This command creates a YAML file for each CredentialsRequest object.
Sample CredentialsRequest object

```yaml
  apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
  kind: CredentialsRequest
  metadata:
    labels:
      controller-tools.k8s.io: "1.0"
    name: openshift-image-registry-ibmcos
    namespace: openshift-cloud-credential-operator
  spec:
    secretRef:
      name: installer-cloud-credentials
      namespace: openshift-image-registry
    providerSpec:
      apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
      kind: IBMCloudProviderSpec
      policies:
      - attributes:
        - name: serviceName
          value: cloud-object-storage
        roles:
        - crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:Viewer
        - crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:Operator
        - crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:Editor
        - crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::serviceRole:Reader
        - crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::serviceRole:Writer
      - attributes:
        - name: resourceType
          value: resource-group
        roles:
        - crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:Viewer
```

5. Create the service ID for each credential request, assign the policies defined, create an API key, and generate the secret:

```terminal
$ ccoctl ibmcloud create-service-id \
  --credentials-requests-dir=<path_to_credential_requests_directory> \1
  --name=<cluster_name> \2
  --output-dir=<installation_directory> \3
  --resource-group-name=<resource_group_name> 4
```

Specify the directory containing the files for the component CredentialsRequest objects.
Specify the name of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
Optional: Specify the directory in which you want the ccoctl utility to create objects. By default, the utility creates objects in the directory in which the commands are run.
Optional: Specify the name of the resource group used for scoping the access policies.

[NOTE]
----
If your cluster uses Technology Preview features that are enabled by the TechPreviewNoUpgrade feature set, you must include the --enable-tech-preview parameter.
If an incorrect resource group name is provided, the installation fails during the bootstrap phase. To find the correct resource group name, run the following command:

```terminal
$ grep resourceGroup <installation_directory>/manifests/cluster-infrastructure-02-config.yml
```

----

* Ensure that the appropriate secrets were generated in your cluster's manifests directory.

# Deploying the cluster

You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on a compatible cloud platform.


[IMPORTANT]
----
You can run the create cluster command of the installation program only once, during initial installation.
----

* You have configured an account with the cloud platform that hosts your cluster.
* You have the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.
* You have verified that the cloud provider account on your host has the correct permissions to deploy the cluster. An account with incorrect permissions causes the installation process to fail with an error message that displays the missing permissions.

* Change to the directory that contains the installation program and initialize the cluster deployment:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install create cluster --dir <installation_directory> \ 1
    --log-level=info 2
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the
location of your customized ./install-config.yaml file.
To view different installation details, specify warn, debug, or
error instead of info.

When the cluster deployment completes successfully:

* The terminal displays directions for accessing your cluster, including a link to the web console and credentials for the kubeadmin user.
* Credential information also outputs to <installation_directory>/.openshift_install.log.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not delete the installation program or the files that the installation program creates. Both are required to delete the cluster.
----


```terminal
...
INFO Install complete!
INFO To access the cluster as the system:admin user when using 'oc', run 'export KUBECONFIG=/home/myuser/install_dir/auth/kubeconfig'
INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.mycluster.example.com
INFO Login to the console with user: "kubeadmin", and password: "password"
INFO Time elapsed: 36m22s
```



[IMPORTANT]
----
* The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending node-bootstrapper certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for Recovering from expired control plane certificates for more information.
* It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.

# Logging in to the cluster by using the CLI

You can log in to your cluster as a default system user by exporting the cluster kubeconfig file.
The kubeconfig file contains information about the cluster that is used by the CLI to connect a client to the correct cluster and API server.
The file is specific to a cluster and is created during Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation.

* You deployed an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* You installed the oc CLI.

1. Export the kubeadmin credentials:

```terminal
$ export KUBECONFIG=<installation_directory>/auth/kubeconfig 1
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the path to the directory that you stored
the installation files in.
2. Verify you can run oc commands successfully using the exported configuration:

```terminal
$ oc whoami
```

Example output

```terminal
system:admin
```


* Accessing the web console

# Telemetry access for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, the Telemetry service, which runs by default to provide metrics about cluster health and the success of updates, requires internet access. If your cluster is connected to the internet, Telemetry runs automatically, and your cluster is registered to https://console.redhat.com/openshift [OpenShift Cluster Manager].

After you confirm that your https://console.redhat.com/openshift [OpenShift Cluster Manager] inventory is correct, either maintained automatically by Telemetry or manually by using OpenShift Cluster Manager, use subscription watch to track your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform subscriptions at the account or multi-cluster level.
