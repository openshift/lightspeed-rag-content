# Installation requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure on AWS


Before you begin an installation on infrastructure that you provision, be sure that your AWS environment meets the following installation requirements.
For a cluster that contains user-provisioned infrastructure, you must deploy all
of the required machines.

# Required machines for cluster installation

The smallest Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters require the following hosts:




[IMPORTANT]
----
To maintain high availability of your cluster, use separate physical hosts for
these cluster machines.
----

The bootstrap and control plane machines must use Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) as the operating system. However, the compute machines can choose between Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS), Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.6 and later.

Note that RHCOS is based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9.2 and inherits all of its hardware certifications and requirements.
See Red Hat Enterprise Linux technology capabilities and limits.

## Minimum resource requirements for cluster installation

Each cluster machine must meet the following minimum requirements:



1. One vCPU is equivalent to one physical core when simultaneous multithreading (SMT), or Hyper-Threading, is not enabled. When enabled, use the following formula to calculate the corresponding ratio: (threads per core × cores) × sockets = vCPUs.
2. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and Kubernetes are sensitive to disk performance, and faster storage is recommended, particularly for etcd on the control plane nodes which require a 10 ms p99 fsync duration. Note that on many cloud platforms, storage size and IOPS scale together, so you might need to over-allocate storage volume to obtain sufficient performance.
3. As with all user-provisioned installations, if you choose to use RHEL compute machines in your cluster, you take responsibility for all operating system life cycle management and maintenance, including performing system updates, applying patches, and completing all other required tasks. Use of RHEL 7 compute machines is deprecated and has been removed in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 and later.


[NOTE]
----
As of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.13, RHCOS is based on RHEL version 9.2, which updates the micro-architecture requirements. The following list contains the minimum instruction set architectures (ISA) that each architecture requires:
* x86-64 architecture requires x86-64-v2 ISA
* ARM64 architecture requires ARMv8.0-A ISA
* IBM Power architecture requires Power 9 ISA
* s390x architecture requires z14 ISA
For more information, see Architectures (RHEL documentation).
----

If an instance type for your platform meets the minimum requirements for cluster machines, it is supported to use in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

## Tested instance types for AWS

The following Amazon Web Services (AWS) instance types have been tested with
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.


[NOTE]
----
Use the machine types included in the following charts for your AWS instances. If you use an instance type that is not listed in the chart, ensure that the instance size you use matches the minimum resource requirements that are listed in the section named "Minimum resource requirements for cluster installation".

## Tested instance types for AWS on 64-bit ARM infrastructures

The following Amazon Web Services (AWS) 64-bit ARM instance types have been tested with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.


[NOTE]
----
Use the machine types included in the following charts for your AWS ARM instances. If you use an instance type that is not listed in the chart, ensure that the instance size you use matches the minimum resource requirements that are listed in "Minimum resource requirements for cluster installation".

# Certificate signing requests management

Because your cluster has limited access to automatic machine management when you use infrastructure that you provision, you must provide a mechanism for approving cluster certificate signing requests (CSRs) after installation. The kube-controller-manager only approves the kubelet client CSRs. The machine-approver cannot guarantee the validity of a serving certificate that is requested by using kubelet credentials because it cannot confirm that the correct machine issued the request. You must determine and implement a method of verifying the validity of the kubelet serving certificate requests and approving them.

# Required AWS infrastructure components

To install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on user-provisioned infrastructure in Amazon Web Services (AWS), you must manually create both the machines and their supporting infrastructure.

For more information about the integration testing for different platforms, see the OpenShift Container Platform 4.x Tested Integrations page.

By using the provided CloudFormation templates, you can create stacks of AWS resources that represent the following components:

* An AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
* Networking and load balancing components
* Security groups and roles
* An Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform bootstrap node
* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform control plane nodes
* An Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform compute node

Alternatively, you can manually create the components or you can reuse existing infrastructure that meets the cluster requirements. Review the CloudFormation templates for more details about how the components interrelate.

## Other infrastructure components

* A VPC
* DNS entries
* Load balancers (classic or network) and listeners
* A public and a private Route 53 zone
* Security groups
* IAM roles
* S3 buckets

If you are working in a disconnected environment, you are unable to reach the public IP addresses for EC2, ELB, and S3 endpoints. Depending on the level to which you want to restrict internet traffic during the installation, the following configuration options are available:

### Option 1: Create VPC endpoints

Create a VPC endpoint and attach it to the subnets that the clusters are using. Name the endpoints as follows:

* ec2.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com
* elasticloadbalancing.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com
* s3.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com

With this option, network traffic remains private between your VPC and the required AWS services.

### Option 2: Create a proxy without VPC endpoints

As part of the installation process, you can configure an HTTP or HTTPS proxy. With this option, internet traffic goes through the proxy to reach the required AWS services.

### Option 3: Create a proxy with VPC endpoints

As part of the installation process, you can configure an HTTP or HTTPS proxy with VPC endpoints. Create a VPC endpoint and attach it to the subnets that the clusters are using. Name the endpoints as follows:

* ec2.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com
* elasticloadbalancing.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com
* s3.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com

When configuring the proxy in the install-config.yaml file, add these endpoints to the noProxy field. With this option, the proxy prevents the cluster from accessing the internet directly. However, network traffic remains private between your VPC and the required AWS services.

You must provide a suitable VPC and subnets that allow communication to your
machines.



Your DNS and load balancer configuration needs to use a public hosted zone and
can use a private hosted zone similar to the one that the installation program
uses if it provisions the cluster&#8217;s infrastructure. You must
create a DNS entry that resolves to your load balancer. An entry for
api.<cluster_name>.<domain> must point to the external load balancer, and an
entry for api-int.<cluster_name>.<domain> must point to the internal load
balancer.

The cluster also requires load balancers and listeners for port 6443, which are
required for the Kubernetes API and its extensions, and port 22623, which are
required for the Ignition config files for new machines. The targets will be the
control plane nodes. Port 6443 must be accessible to both clients external to the
cluster and nodes within the cluster. Port 22623 must be accessible to nodes
within the cluster.



The control plane and worker machines require access to the following ports:



The control plane machines require the following Ingress groups. Each Ingress group is
a AWS::EC2::SecurityGroupIngress resource.



The worker machines require the following Ingress groups. Each Ingress group is
a AWS::EC2::SecurityGroupIngress resource.



You must grant the machines permissions in AWS. The provided CloudFormation
templates grant the machines Allow permissions for the following AWS::IAM::Role objects
and provide a AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile for each set of roles. If you do
not use the templates, you can grant the machines the following broad permissions
or the following individual permissions.



## Cluster machines

You need AWS::EC2::Instance objects for the following machines:

* A bootstrap machine. This machine is required during installation, but you can remove it after your cluster deploys.
* Three control plane machines. The control plane machines are not governed by a control plane machine set.
* Compute machines. You must create at least two compute machines, which are also known as worker machines, during installation. These machines are not governed by a compute machine set.

# Required AWS permissions for the IAM user


[NOTE]
----
Your IAM user must have the permission tag:GetResources in the region us-east-1 to delete the base cluster resources. As part of the AWS API requirement, the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program performs various actions in this region.
----

When you attach the AdministratorAccess policy to the IAM user that you create in Amazon Web Services (AWS),
you grant that user all of the required permissions. To deploy all components of an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
cluster, the IAM user requires the following permissions:

* ec2:AttachNetworkInterface
* ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress
* ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress
* ec2:CopyImage
* ec2:CreateNetworkInterface
* ec2:CreateSecurityGroup
* ec2:CreateTags

[IMPORTANT]
----
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform uses both the ELB and ELBv2 API services to provision load balancers. The permission list shows permissions required by both services. A known issue exists in the AWS web console where both services use the same elasticloadbalancing action prefix but do not recognize the same actions. You can ignore the warnings about the service not recognizing certain elasticloadbalancing actions.

# Obtaining an AWS Marketplace image

If you are deploying an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster using an AWS Marketplace image, you must first subscribe through AWS. Subscribing to the offer provides you with the AMI ID that the installation program uses to deploy compute nodes.


[NOTE]
----
You should only modify the RHCOS image for compute machines to use {platform-abbreviation} Marketplace image. Control plane machines and infrastructure nodes do not require an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform subscription and use the public RHCOS default image by default, which does not incur subscription costs on your {platform-abbreviation-short} bill. Therefore, you should not modify the cluster default boot image or the control plane boot images. Applying the {platform-abbreviation-short} Marketplace image to them will incur additional licensing costs that cannot be recovered.
----

* You have an AWS account to purchase the offer. This account does not have to be the same account that is used to install the cluster.

1. Complete the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform subscription from the AWS Marketplace.
