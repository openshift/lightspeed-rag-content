# Installing a cluster on Azure Stack Hub with network customizations


In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.16, you can install a cluster with a customized network configuration on infrastructure that the installation program provisions on Azure Stack Hub. By customizing your network configuration, your cluster can coexist with existing IP address allocations in your environment and integrate with existing MTU and VXLAN configurations.

[NOTE]
----
While you can select azure when using the installation program to deploy a cluster using installer-provisioned infrastructure, this option is only supported for the Azure Public Cloud.
----

# Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation and update processes.
* You read the documentation on selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users.
* You configured an Azure Stack Hub account to host the cluster.
* If you use a firewall, you configured it to allow the sites that your cluster requires access to.
* You verified that you have approximately 16 GB of local disk space. Installing the cluster requires that you download the RHCOS virtual hard disk (VHD) cluster image and upload it to your Azure Stack Hub environment so that it is accessible during deployment. Decompressing the VHD files requires this amount of local disk space.

# Internet access for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, you require access to the internet to
install
your cluster.

You must have internet access to:

* Access https://console.redhat.com/openshift [OpenShift Cluster Manager] to download the installation program and perform subscription management. If the cluster has internet access and you do not disable Telemetry, that service automatically entitles your cluster.
* Access Quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install your cluster.
* Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.

# Generating a key pair for cluster node SSH access

During an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation, you can provide an SSH public key to the installation program. The key is passed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) nodes through their Ignition config files and is used to authenticate SSH access to the nodes. The key is added to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys list for the core user on each node, which enables password-less authentication.

After the key is passed to the nodes, you can use the key pair to SSH in to the RHCOS nodes as the user core. To access the nodes through SSH, the private key identity must be managed by SSH for your local user.

If you want to SSH in to your cluster nodes to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, you must provide the SSH public key during the installation process. The ./openshift-install gather command also requires the SSH public key to be in place on the cluster nodes.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not skip this procedure in production environments, where disaster recovery and debugging is required.
----


[NOTE]
----
You must use a local key, not one that you configured with platform-specific
approaches such as
AWS key pairs.
----

1. If you do not have an existing SSH key pair on your local machine to use for authentication onto your cluster nodes, create one. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

```terminal
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N '' -f <path>/<file_name> 1
```

Specify the path and file name, such as ~/.ssh/id_ed25519, of the new SSH key. If you have an existing key pair, ensure your public key is in the your ~/.ssh directory.

[NOTE]
----
If you plan to install an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster that uses the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures, do not create a key that uses the ed25519 algorithm. Instead, create a key that uses the rsa or ecdsa algorithm.
----
2. View the public SSH key:

```terminal
$ cat <path>/<file_name>.pub
```


For example, run the following to view the ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub public key:

```terminal
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

3. Add the SSH private key identity to the SSH agent for your local user, if it has not already been added. SSH agent management of the key is required for password-less SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes, or if you want to use the ./openshift-install gather command.

[NOTE]
----
On some distributions, default SSH private key identities such as ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_dsa are managed automatically.
----
1. If the ssh-agent process is not already running for your local user, start it as a background task:

```terminal
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

Example output

```terminal
Agent pid 31874
```


[NOTE]
----
If your cluster is in FIPS mode, only use FIPS-compliant algorithms to generate the SSH key. The key must be either RSA or ECDSA.
----
4. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent:

```terminal
$ ssh-add <path>/<file_name> 1
```

Specify the path and file name for your SSH private key, such as ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
Example output

```terminal
Identity added: /home/<you>/<path>/<file_name> (<computer_name>)
```


* When you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, provide the SSH public key to the installation program.

# Uploading the RHCOS cluster image

You must download the RHCOS virtual hard disk (VHD) cluster image and upload it to your Azure Stack Hub environment so that it is accessible during deployment.

* Configure an Azure account.

1. Obtain the RHCOS VHD cluster image:
1. Export the URL of the RHCOS VHD to an environment variable.

```terminal
$ export COMPRESSED_VHD_URL=$(openshift-install coreos print-stream-json | jq -r '.architectures.x86_64.artifacts.azurestack.formats."vhd.gz".disk.location')
```

2. Download the compressed RHCOS VHD file locally.

```terminal
$ curl -O -L ${COMPRESSED_VHD_URL}
```

2. Decompress the VHD file.

[NOTE]
----
The decompressed VHD file is approximately 16 GB, so be sure that your host system has 16 GB of free space available. The VHD file can be deleted once you have uploaded it.
----
3. Upload the local VHD to the Azure Stack Hub environment, making sure that the blob is publicly available. For example, you can upload the VHD to a blob using the az cli or the web portal.

# Obtaining the installation program

Before you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, download the installation file on
 the host you are using for installation.

* You have a computer that runs Linux or macOS, with at least 1.2 GB of local disk space.

1. Go to the Cluster Type page on the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console. If you have a Red Hat account, log in with your credentials. If you do not, create an account.
2. Select your infrastructure provider from the Run it yourself section of the page.
3. Select your host operating system and architecture from the dropdown menus under OpenShift Installer and click Download Installer.
4. Place the downloaded file in the directory where you want to store the installation configuration files.

[IMPORTANT]
----
* The installation program creates several files on the computer that you use to install your cluster. You must keep the installation program and the files that the installation program creates after you finish installing the cluster. Both of the files are required to delete the cluster.
* Deleting the files created by the installation program does not remove your cluster, even if the cluster failed during installation. To remove your cluster, complete the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform uninstallation procedures for your specific cloud provider.
----
5. Extract the installation program. For example, on a computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:

```terminal
$ tar -xvf openshift-install-linux.tar.gz
```

6. Download your installation https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret [pull secret from Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager]. This pull secret allows you to authenticate with the services that are provided by the included authorities, including Quay.io, which serves the container images for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform components.


[TIP]
----
Alternatively, you can retrieve the installation program from the Red Hat Customer Portal, where you can specify a version of the installation program to download.
However, you must have an active subscription to access this page.
----

# Manually creating the installation configuration file

Installing the cluster requires that you manually create the installation configuration file.

* You have an SSH public key on your local machine to provide to the installation program. The key will be used for SSH authentication onto your cluster nodes for debugging and disaster recovery.
* You have obtained the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your
cluster.

1. Create an installation directory to store your required installation assets in:

```terminal
$ mkdir <installation_directory>
```


[IMPORTANT]
----
You must create a directory. Some installation assets, like bootstrap X.509
certificates have short expiration intervals, so you must not reuse an
installation directory. If you want to reuse individual files from another
cluster installation, you can copy them into your directory. However, the file
names for the installation assets might change between releases. Use caution
when copying installation files from an earlier Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version.
----
2. Customize the sample install-config.yaml file template that is provided and save
it in the <installation_directory>.

[NOTE]
----
You must name this configuration file install-config.yaml.
----

Make the following modifications:
1. Specify the required installation parameters.
2. Update the platform.azure section to specify the parameters that are specific to Azure Stack Hub.
3. Optional: Update one or more of the default configuration parameters to customize the installation.

For more information about the parameters, see "Installation configuration parameters".
3. Back up the install-config.yaml file so that you can use it to install multiple clusters.

[IMPORTANT]
----
The install-config.yaml file is consumed during the next step of the installation process. You must back it up now.
----

* Installation configuration parameters for Azure Stack Hub

## Sample customized install-config.yaml file for Azure Stack Hub

You can customize the install-config.yaml file to specify more details about your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster&#8217;s platform or modify the values of the required parameters.


[IMPORTANT]
----
This sample YAML file is provided for reference only. Use it as a resource to enter parameter values into the installation configuration file that you created manually.

Required.
If you do not provide these parameters and values, the installation program provides the default value.
The controlPlane section is a single mapping, but the compute section is a sequence of mappings. To meet the requirements of the different data structures, the first line of the compute section must begin with a hyphen, -, and the first line of the controlPlane section must not. Although both sections currently define a single machine pool, it is possible that future versions of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform will support defining multiple compute pools during installation. Only one control plane pool is used.
You can specify the size of the disk to use in GB. Minimum recommendation for control plane nodes is 1024 GB.
The name of the cluster.
The cluster network plugin to install. The default value OVNKubernetes is the only supported value.
The Azure Resource Manager endpoint that your Azure Stack Hub operator provides.
The name of the resource group that contains the DNS zone for your base domain.
The name of your Azure Stack Hub local region.
The name of an existing resource group to install your cluster to. If undefined, a new resource group is created for the cluster.
The URL of a storage blob in the Azure Stack environment that contains an RHCOS VHD.
The pull secret required to authenticate your cluster.
Whether to enable or disable FIPS mode. By default, FIPS mode is not enabled. If FIPS mode is enabled, the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform runs on bypass the default Kubernetes cryptography suite and use the cryptography modules that are provided with RHCOS instead.

[IMPORTANT]
----
When running Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) booted in FIPS mode, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform core components use the RHEL cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures.
----
You can optionally provide the sshKey value that you use to access the machines in your cluster.

[NOTE]
----
For production Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your ssh-agent process uses.
----
If the Azure Stack Hub environment is using an internal Certificate Authority (CA), adding the CA certificate is required.

# Manually manage cloud credentials

The Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) only supports your cloud provider in manual mode. As a result, you must specify the identity and access management (IAM) secrets for your cloud provider.

1. If you have not previously created installation manifest files, do so by running the following command:

```terminal
$ openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory>
```


where <installation_directory> is the directory in which the installation program creates files.
2. Set a $RELEASE_IMAGE variable with the release image from your installation file by running the following command:

```terminal
$ RELEASE_IMAGE=$(./openshift-install version | awk '/release image/ {print $3}')
```

3. Extract the list of CredentialsRequest custom resources (CRs) from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc adm release extract \
  --from=$RELEASE_IMAGE \
  --credentials-requests \
  --included \1
  --install-config=<path_to_directory_with_installation_configuration>/install-config.yaml \2
  --to=<path_to_directory_for_credentials_requests> 3
```

The --included parameter includes only the manifests that your specific cluster configuration requires.
Specify the location of the install-config.yaml file.
Specify the path to the directory where you want to store the CredentialsRequest objects. If the specified directory does not exist, this command creates it.

This command creates a YAML file for each CredentialsRequest object.
Sample CredentialsRequest object

```yaml
apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
kind: CredentialsRequest
metadata:
  name: <component_credentials_request>
  namespace: openshift-cloud-credential-operator
  ...
spec:
  providerSpec:
    apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
    kind: AzureProviderSpec
    roleBindings:
    - role: Contributor
  ...
```

4. Create YAML files for secrets in the openshift-install manifests directory that you generated previously. The secrets must be stored using the namespace and secret name defined in the spec.secretRef for each CredentialsRequest object.
Sample CredentialsRequest object with secrets

```yaml
apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
kind: CredentialsRequest
metadata:
  name: <component_credentials_request>
  namespace: openshift-cloud-credential-operator
  ...
spec:
  providerSpec:
    apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
    kind: AzureProviderSpec
    roleBindings:
    - role: Contributor
      ...
  secretRef:
    name: <component_secret>
    namespace: <component_namespace>
  ...
```

Sample Secret object

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: <component_secret>
  namespace: <component_namespace>
data:
  azure_subscription_id: <base64_encoded_azure_subscription_id>
  azure_client_id: <base64_encoded_azure_client_id>
  azure_client_secret: <base64_encoded_azure_client_secret>
  azure_tenant_id: <base64_encoded_azure_tenant_id>
  azure_resource_prefix: <base64_encoded_azure_resource_prefix>
  azure_resourcegroup: <base64_encoded_azure_resourcegroup>
  azure_region: <base64_encoded_azure_region>
```



[IMPORTANT]
----
Before upgrading a cluster that uses manually maintained credentials, you must ensure that the CCO is in an upgradeable state.
----

* Updating a cluster using the web console
* Updating a cluster using the CLI

# Configuring the cluster to use an internal CA

If the Azure Stack Hub environment is using an internal Certificate Authority (CA), update the cluster-proxy-01-config.yaml file to configure the cluster to use the internal CA.

* Create the install-config.yaml file and specify the certificate trust bundle in .pem format.
* Create the cluster manifests.

1. From the directory in which the installation program creates files, go to the manifests directory.
2. Add user-ca-bundle to  the spec.trustedCA.name field.
Example cluster-proxy-01-config.yaml file

```yaml
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Proxy
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: cluster
spec:
  trustedCA:
    name: user-ca-bundle
status: {}
```

3. Optional: Back up the manifests/ cluster-proxy-01-config.yaml file. The installation program consumes the manifests/ directory when you deploy the cluster.

# Network configuration phases

There are two phases prior to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation where you can customize the network configuration.

Phase 1:: You can customize the following network-related fields in the install-config.yaml file before you create the manifest files:
* networking.networkType
* networking.clusterNetwork
* networking.serviceNetwork
* networking.machineNetwork

For more information, see "Installation configuration parameters".

[NOTE]
----
Set the networking.machineNetwork to match the Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) where the preferred subnet is located.
----

[IMPORTANT]
----
The CIDR range 172.17.0.0/16 is reserved by libVirt. You cannot use any other CIDR range that overlaps with the 172.17.0.0/16 CIDR range for networks in your cluster.
----
Phase 2:: After creating the manifest files by running openshift-install create manifests, you can define a customized Cluster Network Operator manifest with only the fields you want to modify. You can use the manifest to specify advanced network configuration.

During phase 2, you cannot override the values that you specified in phase 1 in the install-config.yaml file. However, you can customize the network plugin during phase 2.

# Specifying advanced network configuration

You can use advanced network configuration for your network plugin to integrate your cluster into your existing network environment.

You can specify advanced network configuration only before you install the cluster.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Customizing your network configuration by modifying the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform manifest files created by the installation program is not supported. Applying a manifest file that you create, as in the following procedure, is supported.
----

* You have created the install-config.yaml file and completed any modifications to it.

1. Change to the directory that contains the installation program and create the manifests:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory> 1
```

<installation_directory> specifies the name of the directory that contains the install-config.yaml file for your cluster.
2. Create a stub manifest file for the advanced network configuration that is named cluster-network-03-config.yml in the <installation_directory>/manifests/ directory:

```terminal
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
```

3. Specify the advanced network configuration for your cluster in the cluster-network-03-config.yml file, such as in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  defaultNetwork:
    ovnKubernetesConfig:
      ipsecConfig:
        mode: Full
```
4. Optional: Back up the manifests/cluster-network-03-config.yml file. The
installation program consumes the manifests/ directory when you create the
Ignition config files.

# Cluster Network Operator configuration

The configuration for the cluster network is specified as part of the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) configuration and stored in a custom resource (CR) object that is named cluster. The CR specifies the fields for the Network API in the operator.openshift.io API group.

The CNO configuration inherits the following fields during cluster installation from the Network API in the Network.config.openshift.io API group:

clusterNetwork:: IP address pools from which pod IP addresses are allocated.
serviceNetwork:: IP address pool for services.
defaultNetwork.type:: Cluster network plugin. OVNKubernetes is the only supported plugin during installation.

You can specify the cluster network plugin configuration for your cluster by setting the fields for the defaultNetwork object in the CNO object named cluster.

## Cluster Network Operator configuration object

The fields for the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) are described in the following table:



## defaultNetwork object configuration

The values for the defaultNetwork object are defined in the following table:



## Configuration for the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin

The following table describes the configuration fields for the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin:


















```yaml
defaultNetwork:
  type: OVNKubernetes
  ovnKubernetesConfig:
    mtu: 1400
    genevePort: 6081
      ipsecConfig:
        mode: Full
```



[IMPORTANT]
----
Using OVNKubernetes can lead to a stack exhaustion problem on IBM Power(R).
----

## kubeProxyConfig object configuration (OpenShiftSDN container network interface only)

The values for the kubeProxyConfig object are defined in the following table:



# Configuring hybrid networking with OVN-Kubernetes

You can configure your cluster to use hybrid networking with the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin. This allows a hybrid cluster that supports different node networking configurations.


[NOTE]
----
This configuration is necessary to run both Linux and Windows nodes in the same cluster.
----

* You defined OVNKubernetes for the networking.networkType parameter in the install-config.yaml file. See the installation documentation for configuring Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform network customizations on your chosen cloud provider for more information.

1. Change to the directory that contains the installation program and create the manifests:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory>
```

where:
<installation_directory>:: Specifies the name of the directory that contains the install-config.yaml file for your cluster.
2. Create a stub manifest file for the advanced network configuration that is named cluster-network-03-config.yml in the <installation_directory>/manifests/ directory:

```terminal
$ cat <<EOF > <installation_directory>/manifests/cluster-network-03-config.yml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
EOF
```

where:
<installation_directory>:: Specifies the directory name that contains the
manifests/ directory for your cluster.
3. Open the cluster-network-03-config.yml file in an editor and configure OVN-Kubernetes with hybrid networking, as in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  defaultNetwork:
    ovnKubernetesConfig:
      hybridOverlayConfig:
        hybridClusterNetwork: 1
        - cidr: 10.132.0.0/14
          hostPrefix: 23
        hybridOverlayVXLANPort: 9898 2
```

Specify the CIDR configuration used for nodes on the additional overlay network. The hybridClusterNetwork CIDR must not overlap with the clusterNetwork CIDR.
Specify a custom VXLAN port for the additional overlay network. This is required for running Windows nodes in a cluster installed on vSphere, and must not be configured for any other cloud provider. The custom port can be any open port excluding the default 4789 port. For more information on this requirement, see the Microsoft documentation on Pod-to-pod connectivity between hosts is broken.

[NOTE]
----
Windows Server Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC): Windows Server 2019 is not supported on clusters with a custom hybridOverlayVXLANPort value because this Windows server version does not support selecting a custom VXLAN port.
----


[NOTE]
----
For more information about using Linux and Windows nodes in the same cluster, see Understanding Windows container workloads.

# Deploying the cluster

You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on a compatible cloud platform.


[IMPORTANT]
----
You can run the create cluster command of the installation program only once, during initial installation.
----

* You have configured an account with the cloud platform that hosts your cluster.
* You have the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.
* You have verified that the cloud provider account on your host has the correct permissions to deploy the cluster. An account with incorrect permissions causes the installation process to fail with an error message that displays the missing permissions.

* Change to the directory that contains the installation program and initialize the cluster deployment:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install create cluster --dir <installation_directory> \ 1
    --log-level=info 2
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the
location of your customized ./install-config.yaml file.
To view different installation details, specify warn, debug, or
error instead of info.

When the cluster deployment completes successfully:

* The terminal displays directions for accessing your cluster, including a link to the web console and credentials for the kubeadmin user.
* Credential information also outputs to <installation_directory>/.openshift_install.log.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not delete the installation program or the files that the installation program creates. Both are required to delete the cluster.
----


```terminal
...
INFO Install complete!
INFO To access the cluster as the system:admin user when using 'oc', run 'export KUBECONFIG=/home/myuser/install_dir/auth/kubeconfig'
INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.mycluster.example.com
INFO Login to the console with user: "kubeadmin", and password: "password"
INFO Time elapsed: 36m22s
```



[IMPORTANT]
----
* The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending node-bootstrapper certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for Recovering from expired control plane certificates for more information.
* It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.

* Verify your installation by using an oc command:

```terminal
$ oc <command>
```


# Logging in to the cluster by using the CLI

You can log in to your cluster as a default system user by exporting the cluster kubeconfig file.
The kubeconfig file contains information about the cluster that is used by the CLI to connect a client to the correct cluster and API server.
The file is specific to a cluster and is created during Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation.

* You deployed an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* You installed the oc CLI.

1. Export the kubeadmin credentials:

```terminal
$ export KUBECONFIG=<installation_directory>/auth/kubeconfig 1
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the path to the directory that you stored
the installation files in.
2. Verify you can run oc commands successfully using the exported configuration:

```terminal
$ oc whoami
```

Example output

```terminal
system:admin
```


# Logging in to the cluster by using the web console

The kubeadmin user exists by default after an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation. You can log in to your cluster as the kubeadmin user by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

* You have access to the installation host.
* You completed a cluster installation and all cluster Operators are available.

1. Obtain the password for the kubeadmin user from the kubeadmin-password file on the installation host:

```terminal
$ cat <installation_directory>/auth/kubeadmin-password
```


[NOTE]
----
Alternatively, you can obtain the kubeadmin password from the <installation_directory>/.openshift_install.log log file on the installation host.
----
2. List the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console route:

```terminal
$ oc get routes -n openshift-console | grep 'console-openshift'
```


[NOTE]
----
Alternatively, you can obtain the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform route from the <installation_directory>/.openshift_install.log log file on the installation host.
----
Example output

```terminal
console     console-openshift-console.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>            console     https   reencrypt/Redirect   None
```

3. Navigate to the route detailed in the output of the preceding command in a web browser and log in as the kubeadmin user.

* Accessing the web console.

# Telemetry access for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, the Telemetry service, which runs by default to provide metrics about cluster health and the success of updates, requires internet access. If your cluster is connected to the internet, Telemetry runs automatically, and your cluster is registered to https://console.redhat.com/openshift [OpenShift Cluster Manager].

After you confirm that your https://console.redhat.com/openshift [OpenShift Cluster Manager] inventory is correct, either maintained automatically by Telemetry or manually by using OpenShift Cluster Manager, use subscription watch to track your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform subscriptions at the account or multi-cluster level.
