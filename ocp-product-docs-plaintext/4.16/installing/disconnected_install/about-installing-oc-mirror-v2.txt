# Mirroring images for a disconnected installation by using the oc-mirror plugin v2


You can run your cluster in a restricted network without direct internet connectivity if you install the cluster from a mirrored set of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform container images in a private registry. This registry must be running whenever your cluster is running.
Just as you can use the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI (oc) plugin, you can also use oc-mirror plugin v2 to mirror images to a mirror registry in your fully or partially disconnected environments. To download the required images from the official Red Hat registries, you must run oc-mirror plugin v2 from a system with internet connectivity.

[IMPORTANT]
----
oc-mirror plugin v2 is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
----

# Prerequisites

* You must have a container image registry that supports Docker V2-2 in the location that hosts the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, such as Red Hat Quay.

[NOTE]
----
If you use Red Hat Quay, use version 3.6 or later with the oc-mirror plugin. See the documentation on Deploying the Red Hat Quay Operator on OpenShift Container Platform (Red Hat Quay documentation). If you need additional assistance selecting and installing a registry, contact your sales representative or Red Hat Support.
----

* If you do not have an existing solution for a container image registry, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform subscribers receive a mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift. This mirror registry is included with your subscription and serves as a small-scale container registry. You can use this registry to mirror the necessary container images of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform for disconnected installations.
* Every machine in the provisioned clusters must have access to the mirror registry. If the registry is unreachable, tasks like installation, updating, or routine operations such as workload relocation, might fail. Mirror registries must be operated in a highly available manner, ensuring their availability aligns with the production availability of your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters.

The following steps outline the high-level workflow on how to mirror images to a mirror registry by using the oc-mirror plugin v2:

1. Create an image set configuration file.
2. Mirror the image set to the target mirror registry by using one of the following workflows:
* Mirror an image set directly to the target mirror registry (mirror to mirror).
* Mirror an image set to disk (Mirror-to-Disk), transfer the tar file to the target environment, then mirror the image set to the target mirror registry (Disk-to-Mirror).
3. Configure your cluster to use the resources generated by the oc-mirror plugin v2.
4. Repeat these steps to update your target mirror registry as necessary.

# About oc-mirror plugin v2

The oc-mirror OpenShift CLI (oc) plugin is a single tool that mirrors all required Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform content and other images to your mirror registry.

To use the new Technology Preview version of oc-mirror, add the --v2 flag to the oc-mirror plugin v2 command line.

oc-mirror plugin v2 has the following features:

* Verifies that the complete image set specified in the image set config is mirrored to the mirrored registry, regardless of whether the images were previously mirrored or not.
* Uses a cache system instead of metadata.
* Maintains minimal archive sizes by incorporating only new images into the archive.
* Generates mirroring archives with content selected by mirroring date.
* Can generate ImageDigestMirrorSet (IDMS), ImageTagMirrorSet (ITMS), instead of ImageContentSourcePolicy (ICSP) for the full image set, rather than just for the incremental changes.
* Saves filter Operator versions by bundle name.
* Does not perform automatic pruning. V2 now has a Delete feature, which grants users more control over deleting images.
* Introduces support for registries.conf. This change facilitates mirroring to multiple enclaves while using the same cache.

## oc-mirror plugin v2 compatibility and support

The oc-mirror plugin v2 is supported for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.


[NOTE]
----
On aarch64, ppc64le, and s390x architectures the oc-mirror plugin v2 is supported only for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform versions 4.14 and later.
----

Use the latest available version of the oc-mirror plugin v2 regardless of which versions of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform you need to mirror.

# Preparing your mirror hosts

To use the oc-mirror plugin v2 for image mirroring, you need to install the plugin and create a file with credentials for container images, enabling you to mirror from Red Hat to your mirror.

## Installing the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI plugin

Install the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI plugin to manage image sets in disconnected environments.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc). If you are mirroring image sets in a fully disconnected environment, ensure the following:
* You have installed the oc-mirror plugin on the host that has internet access.
* The host in the disconnected environment has access to the target mirror registry.
* You have set the umask parameter to 0022 on the operating system that uses oc-mirror.
* You have installed the correct binary for the RHEL version that you are using.

1. Download the oc-mirror CLI plugin.
1. Navigate to the Downloads page of the https://console.redhat.com/openshift [OpenShift Cluster Manager].
2. Under the OpenShift disconnected installation tools section, click Download for OpenShift Client (oc) mirror plugin and save the file.
2. Extract the archive:

```terminal
$ tar xvzf oc-mirror.tar.gz
```

3. If necessary, update the plugin file to be executable:

```terminal
$ chmod +x oc-mirror
```


[NOTE]
----
Do not rename the oc-mirror file.
----
4. Install the oc-mirror CLI plugin by placing the file in your PATH, for example, /usr/local/bin:

```terminal
$ sudo mv oc-mirror /usr/local/bin/.
```


* Verify that the plugin for oc-mirror v2 is successfully installed by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc mirror --v2 --help
```


## Configuring credentials that allow images to be mirrored

Create a container image registry credentials file so that you can mirror images from Red&#160;Hat to your mirror. Complete the following steps on the installation host.


[WARNING]
----
Do not use this image registry credentials file as the pull secret when you install a cluster. If you provide this file when you install cluster, all of the machines in the cluster will have write access to your mirror registry.
----


[WARNING]
----
This process requires that you have write access to a container image registry on the mirror registry and adds the credentials to a registry pull secret.
----

* You configured a mirror registry to use in your disconnected environment.
* You identified an image repository location on your mirror registry to mirror images into.
* You provisioned a mirror registry account that allows images to be uploaded to that image repository.

1. Download your registry.redhat.io https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret [pull secret from Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager].
2. Make a copy of your pull secret in JSON format:

```terminal
$ cat ./pull-secret | jq . > <path>/<pull_secret_file_in_json>
```


Specify the path to the directory to store the pull secret in and a name for the JSON file that you create.

The contents of the file resemble the following example:

```json
{
  "auths": {
    "cloud.openshift.com": {
      "auth": "b3BlbnNo...",
      "email": "you@example.com"
    },
    "quay.io": {
      "auth": "b3BlbnNo...",
      "email": "you@example.com"
    },
    "registry.connect.redhat.com": {
      "auth": "NTE3Njg5Nj...",
      "email": "you@example.com"
    },
    "registry.redhat.io": {
      "auth": "NTE3Njg5Nj...",
      "email": "you@example.com"
    }
  }
}
```

1. If the $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/containers directory does not exist, create one by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ mkdir -p $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/containers
```

2. Save the pull secret file as $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/containers/auth.json.
3. Generate the base64-encoded user name and password or token for your mirror registry by running the following command:

```terminal
$ echo -n '<user_name>:<password>' | base64 -w0
```


For <user_name> and <password>, specify the user name and password that you configured for your registry.
Example output

```terminal
BGVtbYk3ZHAtqXs=
```

4. Edit the JSON
file and add a section that describes your registry to it:

```json
  "auths": {
    "<mirror_registry>": {
      "auth": "<credentials>",
      "email": "you@example.com"
    }
  },
```

* For the <mirror_registry> value, specify the registry domain name, and optionally the port, that your mirror registry uses to serve content. For example, registry.example.com or registry.example.com:8443.
* For the <credentials> value, specify the base64-encoded user name and password for the mirror registry.
Example modified pull secret

```json
{
  "auths": {
    "registry.example.com": {
      "auth": "BGVtbYk3ZHAtqXs=",
      "email": "you@example.com"
    },
    "cloud.openshift.com": {
      "auth": "b3BlbnNo...",
      "email": "you@example.com"
    },
    "quay.io": {
      "auth": "b3BlbnNo...",
      "email": "you@example.com"
    },
    "registry.connect.redhat.com": {
      "auth": "NTE3Njg5Nj...",
      "email": "you@example.com"
    },
    "registry.redhat.io": {
      "auth": "NTE3Njg5Nj...",
      "email": "you@example.com"
    }
  }
}
```


# Mirroring an image set to a mirror registry

Mirroring an image set to a mirror registry ensures that the required images are available in a secure and controlled environment, facilitating smoother deployments, updates, and maintenance tasks.

## Building the image set configuration

The oc-mirror plugin v2 uses the image set configuration as the input file to determine the required images for mirroring.


```yaml
kind: ImageSetConfiguration
apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v2alpha1
mirror:
  platform:
    channels: 1
    - name: stable-4.13
      minVersion: 4.13.10
      maxVersion: 4.13.10
    graph: true  2
  operators:
    - catalog: registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.15 3
      packages:     4
       - name: aws-load-balancer-operator
       - name: 3scale-operator
       - name: node-observability-operator
  additionalImages: 5
   - name: registry.redhat.io/ubi8/ubi:latest
   - name: registry.redhat.io/ubi9/ubi@sha256:20f695d2a91352d4eaa25107535126727b5945bff38ed36a3e59590f495046f0
```


Set the channel to retrieve Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform images from.
Add graph: true to build and push the graph-data image to the mirror registry. The graph-data image is required to create OpenShift Update Service (OSUS). The graph: true field also generates the UpdateService custom resource manifest. The oc command-line interface (CLI) can use the UpdateService custom resource manifest to create OSUS. For more information, see About the OpenShift Update Service.
Set the Operator catalog to retrieve the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform images from.
Specify only certain Operator packages to include in the image set. Remove this field to retrieve all packages in the catalog.
Specify any additional images to include in image set.

[NOTE]
----
In oc-mirror plugin v2, you must use explicit registry hostnames for all images listed under additionalImages. Otherwise, images are mirrored to incorrect target paths.
----

## Mirroring an image set in a partially disconnected environment

You can mirror image sets to a registry using the oc-mirror plugin v2 in environments with restricted internet access.

* You have access to the internet and the mirror registry in the environment where you are running the oc-mirror plugin v2.

* Mirror the images from the specified image set configuration to a specified registry by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc mirror -c isc.yaml --workspace file://<file_path> docker://<mirror_registry_url> --v2 1
```

Specify the URL or address of the mirror registry where the images are stored and from which they need to be deleted.

1. Navigate to the cluster-resources directory within the working-dir directory that was generated in the <file_path> directory.
2. Verify that the YAML files are present for the ImageDigestMirrorSet, ImageTagMirrorSet and CatalogSource resources.

* Configure your cluster to use the resources generated by oc-mirror plugin v2.

## Mirroring an image set in a fully disconnected environment

You can mirror image sets in a fully disconnected environment where the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster cannot access the public internet.

1. Mirror to disk: Prepare an archive containing the image set for mirroring. Internet access is required.
2. Manual step: Transfer the archive to the network of the disconnected mirror registry.
3. Disk to mirror: To mirror the image set from the archive to the target disconnected registry, run oc-mirror plugin v2 from the environment that has access to the mirror registry.

### Mirroring from mirror to disk

You can use the oc-mirror plugin v2 to generate an image set and save the content to disk. You can then transfer the generated image set can to the disconnected environment and mirrored to the target registry.

oc-mirror plugin v2 retrieves the container images from the source specified in the image set configuration and packs them into a tar archive in a local directory.

* Mirror the images from the specified image set configuration to the disk by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc mirror -c isc.yaml file://<file_path> --v2 1
```

Add the required file path.

1. Navigate to the <file_path> directory that was generated.
2. Verify that the archive files have been generated.

* Configure your cluster to use the resources generated by oc-mirror plugin v2.

### Mirroring from disk to mirror

You can use the oc-mirror plugin v2 to mirror image sets from a disk to a target mirror registry.

The oc-mirror plugin v2 retrieves container images from a local disk and transfers them to the specified mirror registry.

* Process the image set file on the disk and mirror the contents to a target mirror registry by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc mirror -c isc.yaml --from file://<file_path> docker://<mirror_registry_url> --v2 1
```

Specify the URL or address of the mirror registry where the images are stored and from which they need to be deleted.

1. Navigate to the cluster-resources directory within the working-dir directory that was generated in the <file_path> directory.
2. Verify that the YAML files are present for the ImageDigestMirrorSet, ImageTagMirrorSet and CatalogSource resources.

* Configure your cluster to use the resources generated by oc-mirror plugin v2.

# Additional resources

* Updating a cluster in a disconnected environment using the OpenShift Update Service.

# About custom resources generated by v2

With oc-mirror plugin v2, ImageDigestMirrorSet (IDMS) and ImageTagMirrorSet (ITMS) are generated by default if at least one image is found to which a tag refers. These sets contain mirrors for images referenced by digest or tag in releases, Operator catalogs and additional images.

The ImageDigestMirrorSet (IDMS) links the mirror registry to the source registry and forwards image pull requests using digest specifications. The ImagetagMirrorSet (ITMS) resource, however, redirects image pull requests by using image tags.

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) uses the CatalogSource resource to retrieve information about the available Operators in the mirror registry.

The OSUS service uses the UpdateService resource to provide Cincinnati graph to the disconnected environment.

## Configuring your cluster to use the resources generated by oc-mirror plugin v2

After you have mirrored your image set to the mirror registry, you must apply the generated ImageDigestMirrorSet (IDMS), ImageTagMirrorSet (ITMS), CatalogSource, and UpdateService to the cluster.


[IMPORTANT]
----
In oc-mirror plugin v2, the IDMS and ITMS files cover the entire image set, unlike the ICSP files in oc-mirror plugin v1. Therefore, the IDMS and ITMS files contain all images of the set even if you only add new images during incremental mirroring.
----

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

* Apply the YAML files from the results directory to the cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <path_to_oc-mirror_workspace>/working-dir/cluster-resources
```


1. Verify that the ImageDigestMirrorSet resources are successfully installed by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get imagedigestmirrorset
```

2. Verify that the ImageTagMirrorSet resources are successfully installed by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get imagetagmirrorset
```

3. Verify that the CatalogSource resources are successfully installed by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get catalogsource -n openshift-marketplace
```


# Deletion of images from your disconnected environment

Before you can use oc-mirror plugin v2, you must delete previously deployed images. oc-mirror plugin v2 no longer performs automatic pruning.

You must create the DeleteImageSetConfiguration file to delete image configuration when using oc-mirror plugin v2. This prevents accidentally deleting necessary or deployed images when making changes with ImageSetConfig.yaml.

In the following example, DeleteImageSetConfiguration removes the following:

* All images of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release 4.13.3.
* The catalog image redhat-operator-index v4.12.
* The aws-load-balancer-operator v0.0.1 bundle and all its related images.
* The additional images ubi and ubi-minimal referenced by their corresponding digests.


```yaml
apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v2alpha1
kind: DeleteImageSetConfiguration
delete:
  platform:
    channels:
      - name: stable-4.13
        minVersion: 4.13.3
        maxVersion: 4.13.3
  operators:
    - catalog: registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.12
      packages:
      - name: aws-load-balancer-operator
         minVersion: 0.0.1
         maxVersion: 0.0.1
  additionalImages:
    - name: registry.redhat.io/ubi8/ubi@sha256:bce7e9f69fb7d4533447232478fd825811c760288f87a35699f9c8f030f2c1a6
    - name: registry.redhat.io/ubi8/ubi-minimal@sha256:8bedbe742f140108897fb3532068e8316900d9814f399d676ac78b46e740e34e
```



[IMPORTANT]
----
* Consider using the mirror-to-disk and disk-to-mirror workflows to reduce deletion issues.
* In oc-mirror plugin v2, you must use explicit registry hostnames for all images listed under additionalImages. Otherwise, images are mirrored to incorrect target paths.
----

In the image delete workflow, oc-mirror plugin v2 deletes only the manifests of the images, which does not reduce the storage occupied in the registry.

To free up storage space from unnecessary images, such as those with deleted manifests, you must enable the garbage collector on your container registry. With the garbage collector enabled, the registry will delete the image blobs that no longer have references to any manifests, thereby reducing the storage previously occupied by the deleted blobs. Enabling the garbage collector differs depending on your container registry.


[IMPORTANT]
----
To skip deleting the Operator catalog image when deleting images, you must list the specific Operators under the Operator catalog image in the DeleteImageSetConfiguration file. This ensures that only the specified Operators are deleted, not the catalog image.
If only the Operator catalog image is specified, all Operators within that catalog, as well as the catalog image itself, will be deleted.
----

## Deleting the images from disconnected environment

To delete images from a disconnected environment using the oc-mirror plugin v2, follow the procedure.

1. Create a YAML file that deletes previous images:

```terminal
$ oc mirror delete --config delete-image-set-config.yaml --workspace file://<previously_mirrored_work_folder> --v2 --generate docker://<remote_registry>
```


Where:
* <previously_mirrored_work_folder>: Use the directory where images were previously mirrored or stored during the mirroring process.
* <remote_registry>: Insert the URL or address of the remote container registry from which images will be deleted.
2. Go to the <previously_mirrored_work_folder>/delete directory that was created.
3. Verify that the delete-images.yaml file has been generated.
4. Manually ensure that each image listed in the file is no longer needed by the cluster and can be safely removed from the registry.
5. After you generate the delete YAML file, delete the images from the remote registry:

```terminal
$ oc-mirror delete --v2 --delete-yaml-file <previously_mirrored_work_folder>/delete/delete-images.yaml docker://<remote_registry>
```


Where:
* <previously_mirrored_work_folder>: Specify your previously mirrored work folder.
* <remote_registry>: Specifies the URL or address of the remote container registry from which images will be deleted.

[IMPORTANT]
----
When using the mirror-to-mirror procedure, images are not cached locally, so you cannot delete images from a local cache.
----

# Comparison of oc-mirror workflows

Use the following table to compare the supported use cases for the mirror-to-disk (m2d), disk-to-mirror (d2m), and mirror-to-mirror (m2m) workflows.



# Verifying your selected images for mirroring

You can use oc-mirror plugin v2 to perform a test run (dry run) that does not actually mirror any images. This enables you to review the list of images that would be mirrored. You can also use a dry run to catch any errors with your image set configuration early. When running a dry run on a mirror-to-disk workflow, the oc-mirror plugin v2 checks if all the images within the image set are available in its cache. Any missing images are listed in the missing.txt file. When a dry run is performed before mirroring, both missing.txt and mapping.txt files contain the same list of images.

## Performing dry run for oc-mirror plugin v2

Verify your image set configuration by performing a dry run without mirroring any images. This ensures your setup is correct and prevents unintended changes.

* To perform a test run, run the oc mirror command and append the --dry-run argument to the command:

```terminal
$ oc mirror -c <image_set_config_yaml> --from file://<oc_mirror_workspace_path> docker://<mirror_registry_url> --dry-run --v2
```


Where:
* <image_set_config_yaml>: Use the image set configuration file that you just created.
* <oc_mirror_workspace_path>: Insert the address of the workspace path.
* <mirror_registry_url>: Insert the URL or address of the remote container registry from which images will be deleted.
Example output

```terminal
$ oc mirror --config /tmp/isc_dryrun.yaml file://<oc_mirror_workspace_path> --dry-run --v2

```


1. Navigate to the workspace directory that was generated:

```terminal
$ cd <oc_mirror_workspace_path>
```

2. Review the mapping.txt and missing.txt files that were generated. These files contain a list of all images that would be mirrored.

## Troubleshooting oc-mirror plugin v2 errors

oc-mirror plugin v2 now logs all image mirroring errors in a separate file, making it easier to track and diagnose failures.


[IMPORTANT]
----
When errors occur while mirroring release or release component images, they are critical. This stops the mirroring process immediately.
Errors with mirroring Operators, Operator-related images, or additional images do not stop the mirroring process. Mirroring continues, and oc-mirror plugin v2 logs updates every 8 images.
----

When an image fails to mirror, and that image is mirrored as part of one or more Operator bundles, oc-mirror plugin v2 notifies the user which Operators are incomplete, providing clarity on the Operator bundles affected by the error.

1. Check for server-related issues:
Example error

```terminal
[ERROR]  : [Worker] error mirroring image localhost:55000/openshift/graph-image:latest error: copying image 1/4 from manifest list: trying to reuse blob sha256:edab65b863aead24e3ed77cea194b6562143049a9307cd48f86b542db9eecb6e at destination: pinging container registry localhost:5000: Get "https://localhost:5000/v2/": http: server gave HTTP response to HTTPS client
```

1. Open the mirroring_error_date_time.log file in the  working-dir/logs folder located in the oc-mirror plugin v2 output directory.
2. Look for error messages that typically indicate server-side issues, such as HTTP 500 errors, expired tokens, or timeouts.
3. Retry the mirroring process or contact support if the issue persists.
2. Check for incomplete mirroring of Operators:
Example error

```terminal
error mirroring image docker://registry.redhat.io/3scale-amp2/zync-rhel9@sha256:8bb6b31e108d67476cc62622f20ff8db34efae5d58014de9502336fcc479d86d (Operator bundles: [3scale-operator.v0.11.12] - Operators: [3scale-operator]) error: initializing source docker://localhost:55000/3scale-amp2/zync-rhel9:8bb6b31e108d67476cc62622f20ff8db34efae5d58014de9502336fcc479d86d: reading manifest 8bb6b31e108d67476cc62622f20ff8db34efae5d58014de9502336fcc479d86d in localhost:55000/3scale-amp2/zync-rhel9: manifest unknown

```

1. Check for warnings in the console or log file indicating which Operators are incomplete.

If an Operator is flagged as incomplete, the image related to that Operator likely failed to mirror.
2. Manually mirror the missing image or retry the mirroring process.
3. Check for errors related to generated cluster resources. Even if some images fail to mirror, oc-mirror v2 will still generate cluster resources such as IDMS.yaml and ITMS.yaml files for the successfully mirrored images.
1. Check the output directory for the generated files.
2. If these files are missing for specific images, ensure that no critical errors occurred for those images during the mirroring process.

By following these steps, you can better diagnose issues and ensure smoother mirroring.

# Benefits of enclave support

Enclave support restricts internal access to a specific part of a network. Unlike a demilitarized zone (DMZ) network, which allows inbound and outbound traffic access through firewall boundaries, enclaves do not cross firewall boundaries.

The new enclave support functionality is for scenarios where mirroring is needed for multiple enclaves that are secured behind at least one intermediate disconnected network.

Enclave support has the following benefits:

* You can mirror content for multiple enclaves and centralize it in a single internal registry. Because some customers want to run security checks on the mirrored content, with this setup they can run these checks all at once. The content is then vetted before being mirrored to downstream enclaves.
* You can mirror content directly from the centralized internal registry to enclaves without restarting the mirroring process from the internet for each enclave.
* You can minimize data transfer between network stages, so to ensure that a blob or image is transferred only once from one stage to another.

## Enclave mirroring workflow

![Enclave Support]

The previous image outlines the flow for using the oc-mirror plugin in different environments, including environments with and without an internet connection.

Environment with Internet Connection:

1. The user executes oc-mirror plugin v2 to mirror content from an online registry to a local disk directory.
2. The mirrored content is saved to the disk for transfer to offline environments.

Disconnected Enterprise Environment (No Internet):

* Flow 1:
* The user runs oc-mirror plugin v2 to load the mirrored content from the disk directory, which was transferred from the online environment, into the enterprise-registry.in registry.
* Flow 2:
1. After updating the registries.conf file, the user executes the oc-mirror plugin v2 to mirror content from the enterprise-registry.in registry to an enclave environment.
2. The content is saved to a disk directory for transfer to the enclave.

Enclave Environment (No Internet):

* The user runs oc-mirror plugin v2 to load content from the disk directory into the enclave-registry.in registry.

The image visually represents the data flow across these environments and emphasizes the use of oc-mirror to handle disconnected and enclave environments without an internet connection.

## Mirroring to an enclave

When you mirror to an enclave, you must first transfer the necessary images from one or more enclaves into the enterprise central registry.

The central registry is situated within a secure network, specifically a disconnected environment, and is not directly linked to the public internet. But the user must execute oc mirror in an environment with access to the public internet.

1. Before running oc-mirror plugin v2 in the disconnected environment, create a registries.conf file. The TOML format of the file is described in this specification:

[NOTE]
----
It is recommended to store the file under $HOME/.config/containers/registries.conf or /etc/containers/registries.conf.
----
Example registries.conf

```toml
[[registry]]
location="registry.redhat.io"
[[registry.mirror]]
location="<enterprise-registry.in>"

[[registry]]
location="quay.io"
[[registry.mirror]]
location="<enterprise-registry.in>"
```

2. Generate a mirror archive.
1. To collect all the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform content into an archive on the disk under <file_path>/enterprise-content, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc mirror --v2 -c isc.yaml file://<file_path>/enterprise-content
```

Example of isc.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v2alpha1
kind: ImageSetConfiguration
mirror:
  platform:
    architectures:
      - "amd64"
    channels:
      - name: stable-4.15
        minVersion: 4.15.0
        maxVersion: 4.15.3
```


After the archive is generated, it is transferred to the disconnected environment. The transport mechanism is not part of oc-mirror plugin v2. The enterprise network administrators determine the transfer strategy.

In some cases, the transfer is done manually, in that the disk is physically unplugged from one location, and plugged to another computer in the disconnected environment. In other cases, the Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) or other protocols are used.
3. After the transfer of the archive is done, you can execute oc-mirror plugin v2 again in order to mirror the relevant archive contents to the registry (entrerpise_registry.in in the example) as demonstrated in the following example:

```terminal
$ oc mirror --v2 -c isc.yaml --from file://<disconnected_environment_file_path>/enterprise-content docker://<enterprise_registry.in>/
```


Where:
* --from points to the folder containing the archive. It starts with the file://.
* docker:// is the destination of the mirroring is the final argument. Because it is a docker registry.
* -c (--config) is a mandatory argument. It enables oc-mirror plugin v2 to eventually mirror only sub-parts of the archive to the registry. One archive might contain several Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform releases, but the disconnected environment or an enclave might mirror only a few.
4. Prepare the imageSetConfig YAML file, which describes the content to mirror to the enclave:
Example isc-enclave.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v2alpha1
kind: ImageSetConfiguration
mirror:
  platform:
    architectures:
      - "amd64"
    channels:
      - name: stable-4.15
        minVersion: 4.15.2
        maxVersion: 4.15.2
```


You must run oc-mirror plugin v2 on a machine with access to the disconnected registry. In the previous example, the disconnected environment, enterprise-registry.in, is accessible.
5. Update the graph URL

If you are using graph:true, oc-mirror plugin v2 attempts to reach the cincinnati API endpoint. Because this environment is disconnected, be sure to export the environment variable UPDATE_URL_OVERRIDE to refer to the URL for the OpenShift Update Service (OSUS):

```terminal
$ export UPDATE_URL_OVERRIDE=https://<osus.enterprise.in>/graph
```


For more information on setting up OSUS on an OpenShift cluster, see "Updating a cluster in a disconnected environment using the OpenShift Update Service".


[NOTE]
----
When upgrading Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Extended Update Support (EUS) versions, an intermediate version might be required between the current and target versions. For example, if the current version is 4.14 and target version is 4.16, you might need to include a version such as 4.15.8 in the ImageSetConfiguration when using the oc-mirror plugin v2.
The oc-mirror plugin v2 might not always detect this automatically, so check the Cincinnati graph web page to confirm any required intermediate versions and add them manually to your configuration.
----

1. Generate a mirror archive from the enterprise registry for the enclave.

To prepare an archive for the enclave1, the user executes oc-mirror plugin v2 in the enterprise disconnected environment by using the imageSetConfiguration specific for that enclave. This ensures that only images needed by that enclave are mirrored:

```terminal
$ oc mirror --v2 -c isc-enclave.yaml
file:///disk-enc1/
```


This action collects all the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform content into an archive and generates an archive on disk.
2. After the archive is generated, it will be transferred to the enclave1 network. The transport mechanism is not the responsibility of oc-mirror plugin v2.
3. Mirror contents to the enclave registry

After the transfer of the archive is done, the user can execute oc-mirror plugin v2 again in order to mirror the relevant archive contents to the registry.

```terminal
$ oc mirror --v2 -c isc-enclave.yaml --from file://local-disk docker://registry.enc1.in
```


The administrators of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster in enclave1 are now ready to install or upgrade that cluster.

# How filtering works in the operator catalog

oc-mirror plugin v2 selects the list of bundles for mirroring by processing the information in imageSetConfig.

When oc-mirror plugin v2 selects bundles for mirroring, it does not infer Group Version Kind (GVK) or bundle dependencies, omitting them from the mirroring set. Instead, it strictly adheres to the user instructions. You must explicitly specify any required dependent packages and their versions.

Bundle versions typically use semantic versioning standards (SemVer), and you can sort bundles within a channel by version. You can select buncles that fall within a specific range in the ImageSetConfig.

This selection algorithm ensures consistent outcomes compared to oc-mirror plugin v1. However, it does not include upgrade graph details, such as replaces, skip, and skipRange. This approach differs from the OLM algorithm. It might mirror more bundles than necessary for upgrading a cluster because of potentially shorter upgrade paths between the minVersion and maxVersion.



# ImageSet configuration parameters for oc-mirror plugin v2

The oc-mirror plugin v2 requires an image set configuration file that defines what images to mirror. The following table lists the available parameters for the ImageSetConfiguration resource.


[NOTE]
----
* When selecting bundles for mirroring, the oc-mirror plugin v2 does not automatically detect group/version/kind (GVK) and bundle dependencies. You must explicitly specify the required Operators, their channels, and the Operator versions in the ImageSetConfiguration file. For more information, see "opm CLI reference".
* Using the minVersion and maxVersion properties to filter for a specific Operator version range can result in a multiple channel heads error. The error message states that there are multiple channel heads. This is because when the filter is applied, the update graph of the Operator is truncated.
* OLM requires that every Operator channel contains versions that form an update graph with exactly one end point, that is, the latest version of the Operator. When the filter range is applied, that graph can turn into two or more separate graphs or a graph that has more than one end point.
* To avoid this error, do not filter out the latest version of an Operator. If you still run into the error, depending on the Operator, either the maxVersion property must be increased or the minVersion property must be decreased. Because every Operator graph can be different, you might need to adjust these values until the error resolves.

## Delete ImageSet Configuration parameters

To use the oc-mirror plugin v2, you must have delete image set configuration file that defines which images to delete from the mirror registry. The following table lists the available parameters for the DeleteImageSetConfiguration resource.
