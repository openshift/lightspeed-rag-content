# About disconnected installation mirroring


As a cluster administrator, you can use a mirror registry to ensure that your clusters only use container images that satisfy your organizational controls on external content.

# Mirror registries for installing clusters in disconnected environments

You must mirror required container images into a disconnected environment before you can install and provision a cluster there. To mirror those container images, you must have a mirror registry. Consider the following options for creating and using a mirror registry:

* If you already have a container image registry, such as Red Hat Quay, you can use it as your mirror registry. If you do not already have a registry, you must create one.
* After you establish your registry, you need mirroring tools. To mirror your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform image repository to the mirror registry in your disconnected environment, you can use the oc-mirror OpenShift CLI (`oc`) plugin. The oc-mirror plugin is a single tool that mirrors all required Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform content and other images to your mirror registry. The oc-mirror plugin is the preferred method for mirroring.
* Alternately, you can use the oc adm command to mirror just release and catalog images for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
