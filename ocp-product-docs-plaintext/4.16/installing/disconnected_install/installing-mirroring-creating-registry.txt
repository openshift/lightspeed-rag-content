# Creating a mirror registry with mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift


The mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift is a small and streamlined container registry that you can use as a target for mirroring the required container images of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform for disconnected installations.
If you already have a container image registry, such as Red Hat Quay, you can skip this section and go straight to Mirroring the OpenShift Container Platform image repository.

[IMPORTANT]
----
The mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift is not intended to be a substitute for a production deployment of Red Hat Quay.
----

# Prerequisites

* An Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform subscription.
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8 and 9 with Podman 3.4.2 or later and OpenSSL installed.
* Fully qualified domain name for the Red Hat Quay service, which must resolve through a DNS server.
* Key-based SSH connectivity on the target host. SSH keys are automatically generated for local installs. For remote hosts, you must generate your own SSH keys.
* 2 or more vCPUs.
* 8 GB of RAM.
* About 12 GB for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 release images, or about 358 GB for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 release images and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 Red Hat Operator images.

[IMPORTANT]
----
* Up to 1 TB per stream or more is suggested.
* These requirements are based on local testing results with only release images and Operator images. Storage requirements can vary based on your organization's needs. You might require more space, for example, when you mirror multiple z-streams. You can use standard Red Hat Quay functionality or the proper API callout to remove unnecessary images and free up space.

# Mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift introduction

For disconnected deployments of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, a container registry is required to carry out the installation of the clusters. To run a production-grade registry service on such a cluster, you must create a separate registry deployment to install the first cluster. The mirror registry for Red&#160;Hat OpenShift addresses this need and is included in every OpenShift subscription. It is available for download on the OpenShift console Downloads page.

The mirror registry for Red&#160;Hat OpenShift allows users to install a small-scale version of Red Hat Quay and its required components by using the mirror-registry command-line interface (CLI) tool. The mirror registry for Red&#160;Hat OpenShift is deployed automatically with pre-configured local storage and a local database. It also includes auto-generated user credentials and access permissions with a single set of inputs and no additional configuration choices to get started.

The mirror registry for Red&#160;Hat OpenShift provides a pre-determined network configuration and reports deployed component credentials and access URLs upon success. A limited set of optional configuration inputs such as fully qualified domain name (FQDN) services, superuser name and password, and custom TLS certificates are also provided. This provides users with a container registry so that they can easily create an offline mirror of all Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release content when running Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform in restricted network environments.

Use of the mirror registry for Red&#160;Hat OpenShift is optional if another container registry is already available in the install environment.

## Mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift limitations

The following limitations apply to the mirror registry for Red&#160;Hat OpenShift:

* The mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift is not a highly-available registry and only local file system storage is supported. It is not intended to replace Red Hat Quay or the internal image registry for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
* The mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift is not intended to be a substitute for a production deployment of Red Hat Quay.
* The mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift is only supported for hosting images that are required to install a disconnected Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, such as Release images or Red Hat Operator images. It uses local storage on your Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) machine, and storage supported by RHEL is supported by the mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift.

[NOTE]
----
Because the mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift uses local storage, you should remain aware of the storage usage consumed when mirroring images and use Red Hat Quay's garbage collection feature to mitigate potential issues. For more information about this feature, see "Red Hat Quay garbage collection".
----
* Support for Red Hat product images that are pushed to the mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift for bootstrapping purposes are covered by valid subscriptions for each respective product. A list of exceptions to further enable the bootstrap experience can be found on the Self-managed Red Hat OpenShift sizing and subscription guide.
* Content built by customers should not be hosted by the mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift.
* Using the mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift with more than one cluster is discouraged because multiple clusters can create a single point of failure when updating your cluster fleet. Instead, use the mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift to install a cluster that can host a production-grade, highly-available registry such as Red Hat Quay, which can serve Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform content to other clusters.

# Mirroring on a local host with mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift

This procedure explains how to install the mirror registry for Red&#160;Hat OpenShift on a local host using the mirror-registry installer tool. By doing so, users can create a local host registry running on port 443 for the purpose of storing a mirror of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform images.


[NOTE]
----
Installing the mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift using the mirror-registry CLI tool makes several changes to your machine. After installation, a $HOME/quay-install directory is created, which has installation files, local storage, and the configuration bundle. Trusted SSH keys are generated in case the deployment target is the local host, and systemd files on the host machine are set up to ensure that container runtimes are persistent. Additionally, an initial user named init is created with an automatically generated password. All access credentials are printed at the end of the install routine.
----

1. Download the mirror-registry.tar.gz package for the latest version of the mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift found on the OpenShift console Downloads page.
2. Install the mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift on your local host with your current user account by using the mirror-registry tool. For a full list of available flags, see "mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift flags".

```terminal
$ ./mirror-registry install \
  --quayHostname <host_example_com> \
  --quayRoot <example_directory_name>
```

3. Use the username and password generated during installation to log in to the registry by running the following command:

```terminal
$ podman login -u init \
  -p <password> \
  <host_example_com>:8443> \
  --tls-verify=false 1
```

You can avoid running --tls-verify=false by configuring your system to trust the generated rootCA certificates. See "Securing Red Hat Quay" and "Configuring the system to trust the certificate authority" for more information.

[NOTE]
----
You can also log in by accessing the UI at \https://<host.example.com>:8443 after installation.
----
4. You can mirror Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform images after logging in. Depending on your needs, see either the "Mirroring the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform image repository" or the "Mirroring Operator catalogs for use with disconnected clusters" sections of this document.

[NOTE]
----
If there are issues with images stored by the mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift due to storage layer problems, you can remirror the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform images, or reinstall mirror registry on more stable storage.

# Updating mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift from a local host

This procedure explains how to update the mirror registry for Red&#160;Hat OpenShift from a local host using the upgrade command. Updating to the latest version ensures new features, bug fixes, and security vulnerability fixes.


[IMPORTANT]
----
When upgrading from version 1 to version 2, be aware of the following constraints:
* The worker count is set to 1 because multiple writes are not allowed in SQLite.
* You must not use the mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift user interface (UP).
* Do not access the sqlite-storage Podman volume during the upgrade.
* There is intermittent downtime of your mirror registry because it is restarted during the upgrade process.
* PostgreSQL data is backed up under the /$HOME/quay-install/quay-postgres-backup/ directory for recovery.
----

* You have installed the mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift on a local host.

* If you are upgrading the mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift from 1.3 -> 2.y, and your installation directory is the default at /etc/quay-install, you can enter the following command:

```terminal
$ sudo ./mirror-registry upgrade -v
```


[NOTE]
----
* mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift migrates Podman volumes for Red Hat Quay storage, Postgres data, and /etc/quay-install data to the new $HOME/quay-install location. This allows you to use mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift without the --quayRoot flag during future upgrades.
* Users who upgrade mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift with the ./mirror-registry upgrade -v flag must include the same credentials used when creating their mirror registry. For example, if you installed the mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift with --quayHostname <host_example_com> and --quayRoot <example_directory_name>, you must include that string to properly upgrade the mirror registry.
----
* If you are upgrading the mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift from 1.3 -> 2.y and you used a custom quay configuration and storage directory in your 1.y deployment, you must pass in the --quayRoot and --quayStorage flags. For example:

```terminal
$ sudo ./mirror-registry upgrade --quayHostname <host_example_com> --quayRoot <example_directory_name>  --quayStorage <example_directory_name>/quay-storage -v
```

* If you are upgrading the  mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift from 1.3 -> 2.y and want to specify a custom SQLite storage path, you must pass in the --sqliteStorage flag, for example:

```terminal
$ sudo ./mirror-registry upgrade --sqliteStorage <example_directory_name>/sqlite-storage -v
```


1. Ensure that mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift has been updated by running the following command:

```terminal
$ podman ps
```

Example output

```terminal
registry.redhat.io/quay/quay-rhel8:v3.12.10
```
