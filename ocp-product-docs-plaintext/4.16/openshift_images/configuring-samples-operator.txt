# Configuring the Cluster Samples Operator


The Cluster Samples Operator, which operates in the openshift namespace, installs and updates the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)-based Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform image streams and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform templates.

[IMPORTANT]
----
* Starting from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, the Cluster Samples Operator is deprecated. No new templates, samples, or non-Source-to-Image (Non-S2I) image streams will be added to the Cluster Samples Operator. However, the existing S2I builder image streams and templates will continue to receive updates until the Cluster Samples Operator is removed in a future release. S2I image streams and templates include:
* Ruby
* Python
* Node.js
* Perl
* PHP
* HTTPD
* Nginx
* EAP
* Java
* Webserver
* .NET
* Go
* The Cluster Samples Operator will stop managing and providing support to the non-S2I samples (image streams and templates). You can contact the image stream or template owner for any requirements and future plans. In addition, refer to the list of the repositories hosting the image stream or templates.
----

# Understanding the Cluster Samples Operator

During installation, the Operator creates the default configuration object for
itself and then creates the sample image streams and templates, including quick start templates.


[NOTE]
----
To facilitate image stream imports from other registries that require credentials, a cluster administrator can create any additional secrets that contain the content of a Docker config.json file in the openshift namespace needed for image import.
----

The Cluster Samples Operator configuration is a cluster-wide resource, and the deployment is contained within the openshift-cluster-samples-operator namespace.

The image for the Cluster Samples Operator contains image stream and template definitions
for the associated Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release. When each sample is created or updated,
the Cluster Samples Operator includes an annotation that denotes the version of
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. The Operator uses this annotation to ensure that each sample
matches the release version. Samples outside of its inventory are ignored, as
are skipped samples. Modifications to any samples that are managed by the
Operator, where that version annotation is modified or deleted, are reverted
automatically.


[NOTE]
----
The Jenkins images are part of the image payload from
installation and are tagged into the image streams directly.
----

The Cluster Samples Operator configuration resource includes a finalizer which cleans up
the following upon deletion:

* Operator managed image streams.
* Operator managed templates.
* Operator generated configuration resources.
* Cluster status resources.

Upon deletion of the samples resource, the Cluster Samples Operator recreates the
resource using the default configuration.

## Cluster Samples Operator's use of management state

The Cluster Samples Operator is bootstrapped as Managed by default or if global proxy is configured. In the Managed state, the Cluster Samples Operator is actively managing its resources and keeping the component active in order to pull sample image streams and images from the registry and ensure that the requisite sample templates are installed.

Certain circumstances result in the Cluster Samples Operator bootstrapping itself as Removed including:

* If the Cluster Samples Operator cannot reach registry.redhat.io after three minutes on initial startup after a clean installation.
* If the Cluster Samples Operator detects it is on an IPv6 network.
* If the image controller configuration parameters prevent the creation of image streams by using the default image registry, or by using the image registry specified by the samplesRegistry setting.


[NOTE]
----
For Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, the default image registry is
----

However, if the Cluster Samples Operator detects that it is on an IPv6 network and an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform global proxy is configured, then IPv6 check supersedes all the checks. As a result, the Cluster Samples Operator bootstraps itself as Removed.


[IMPORTANT]
----
IPv6 installations are not currently supported by registry.redhat.io. The Cluster Samples Operator pulls most of the sample image streams and images from registry.redhat.io.
----

### Restricted network installation

Boostrapping as Removed when unable to access registry.redhat.io facilitates restricted network installations when the network restriction is already in place. Bootstrapping as Removed when network access is restricted allows the cluster administrator more time to decide if samples are desired, because the Cluster Samples Operator does not submit alerts that sample image stream imports are failing when the management state is set to Removed. When the Cluster Samples Operator comes up as Managed and attempts to install sample image streams, it starts alerting two hours after initial installation if there are failing imports.

### Restricted network installation with initial network access

Conversely, if a cluster that is intended to be a restricted network or disconnected cluster is first installed while network access exists, the Cluster Samples Operator installs the content from registry.redhat.io since it can access it. If you want the Cluster Samples Operator to still bootstrap as Removed in order to defer samples installation until you have decided which samples are desired, set up image mirrors, and so on, then follow the instructions for using the Samples Operator with an alternate registry and customizing nodes, both linked in the additional resources section, to override the Cluster Samples Operator default configuration and initially come up as Removed.

You must put the following additional YAML file in the openshift directory created by openshift-install create manifest:


```yaml
apiVersion: samples.operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Config
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  architectures:
  - x86_64
  managementState: Removed
```


## Cluster Samples Operator's tracking and error recovery of image stream imports

After creation or update of a samples image stream, the Cluster Samples Operator monitors the progress of each image stream tag&#8217;s image import.

If an import fails, the Cluster Samples Operator retries the import through the image stream image import API, which is the same API used by the oc import-image command, approximately every 15 minutes until it sees the import succeed, or if
the Cluster Samples Operator&#8217;s configuration is changed such that either the image stream is added to the skippedImagestreams list, or the management state is changed to Removed.

## Additional resources

* If the Cluster Samples Operator is removed during installation, you can use the Cluster Samples Operator with an alternate registry so content can be imported, and then set the Cluster Samples Operator to Managed to get the samples.
* To ensure the Cluster Samples Operator bootstraps as Removed in a restricted network installation with initial network access to defer samples installation until you have decided which samples are desired, follow the instructions for customizing nodes to override the Cluster Samples Operator default configuration and initially come up as Removed.
* To host samples in your disconnected environment, follow the instructions for using the Cluster Samples Operator with an alternate registry.

## Cluster Samples Operator assistance for mirroring

During installation, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform creates a config map named imagestreamtag-to-image in the openshift-cluster-samples-operator namespace. The imagestreamtag-to-image config map contains an entry, the populating image, for each image stream tag.

The format of the key for each entry in the data field in the config map is <image_stream_name>_<image_stream_tag_name>.

During a disconnected installation of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, the status of the Cluster Samples Operator is set to Removed. If you choose to change it to Managed, it installs samples.


[NOTE]
----
The use of samples in a network-restricted or discontinued environment may require access to services external to your network. Some example services include: Github, Maven Central, npm, RubyGems, PyPi and others. There might be additional steps to take that allow the cluster samples operators's objects to reach the services they require.
----

You can use this config map as a reference for which images need to be mirrored for your image streams to import.

* While the Cluster Samples Operator is set to Removed, you can create your mirrored registry, or determine which existing mirrored registry you want to use.
* Mirror the samples you want to the mirrored registry using the new config map as your guide.
* Add any of the image streams you did not mirror to the skippedImagestreams list of the Cluster Samples Operator configuration object.
* Set samplesRegistry of the Cluster Samples Operator configuration object to the mirrored registry.
* Then set the Cluster Samples Operator to Managed to install the image streams you have mirrored.

See Using Cluster Samples Operator image streams with alternate or mirrored registries for a detailed procedure.

# Cluster Samples Operator configuration parameters

The samples resource offers the following configuration fields:



Secret, image stream, and template watch events can come in before the initial samples resource object is created, the Cluster Samples Operator detects and re-queues the event.

## Configuration restrictions

When the Cluster Samples Operator starts supporting multiple architectures, the architecture list is not allowed to be changed while in the Managed state.

To change the architectures values, a cluster administrator must:

* Mark the Management State as Removed, saving the change.
* In a subsequent change, edit the architecture and change the Management State back to Managed.

The Cluster Samples Operator still processes secrets while in Removed state. You can create the secret before switching to Removed, while in Removed before switching to Managed, or after switching to Managed state. There are delays in creating the samples until the secret event is processed if you create the secret after switching to Managed. This helps facilitate the changing of the registry, where you choose to remove all the samples before switching to insure a clean slate. Removing all samples before switching is not required.

## Conditions

The samples resource maintains the following conditions in its status:



# Accessing the Cluster Samples Operator configuration

You can configure the Cluster Samples Operator by editing the file with the provided parameters.

* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

* Access the  Cluster Samples Operator configuration:

```terminal
$ oc edit configs.samples.operator.openshift.io/cluster -o yaml
```


The Cluster Samples Operator configuration resembles the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: samples.operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Config
# ...
```


# Removing deprecated image stream tags from the Cluster Samples Operator

The Cluster Samples Operator leaves deprecated image stream tags in an image stream because users can have deployments that use the deprecated image stream tags.

You can remove deprecated image stream tags by editing the image stream with the  oc tag command.


[NOTE]
----
Deprecated image stream tags that the samples providers have removed from their image streams are not included on initial installations.
----

* You installed the oc CLI.

* Remove deprecated image stream tags by editing the image stream with the  oc tag command.

```terminal
$ oc tag -d <image_stream_name:tag>
```

Example output

```terminal
Deleted tag default/<image_stream_name:tag>.
```
