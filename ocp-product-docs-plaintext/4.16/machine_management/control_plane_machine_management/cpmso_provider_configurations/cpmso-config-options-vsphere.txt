# Control plane configuration options for VMware vSphere


You can change the configuration of your VMware vSphere control plane machines by updating values in the control plane machine set.
When you save an update to the control plane machine set, the Control Plane Machine Set Operator updates the control plane machines according to your configured update strategy.

# Sample YAML for configuring VMware vSphere clusters

The following example YAML snippets show provider specification and failure domain configurations for a vSphere cluster.

## Sample VMware vSphere provider specification

When you create a control plane machine set for an existing cluster, the provider specification must match the providerSpec configuration in the control plane machine custom resource (CR) that is created by the installation program.


```yaml
apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1
kind: ControlPlaneMachineSet
metadata:
  name: cluster
  namespace: openshift-machine-api
spec:
# ...
  template:
# ...
      spec:
        providerSpec:
          value:
            apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
            credentialsSecret:
              name: vsphere-cloud-credentials 1
            diskGiB: 120 2
            kind: VSphereMachineProviderSpec 3
            memoryMiB: 16384 4
            metadata:
              creationTimestamp: null
            network: 5
              devices:
              - networkName: <vm_network_name>
            numCPUs: 4 6
            numCoresPerSocket: 4 7
            snapshot: ""
            template: <vm_template_name> 8
            userDataSecret:
              name: master-user-data 9
            workspace:
              datacenter: <vcenter_datacenter_name> 10
              datastore: <vcenter_datastore_name> 11
              folder: <path_to_vcenter_vm_folder> 12
              resourcePool: <vsphere_resource_pool> 13
              server: <vcenter_server_ip> 14
```


Specifies the secret name for the cluster. Do not change this value.
Specifies the VM disk size for the control plane machines.
Specifies the cloud provider platform type. Do not change this value.
Specifies the memory allocated for the control plane machines.
Specifies the network on which the control plane is deployed.
Specifies the number of CPUs allocated for the control plane machines.
Specifies the number of cores for each control plane CPU.
Specifies the vSphere VM template to use, such as user-5ddjd-rhcos.
Specifies the control plane user data secret. Do not change this value.
Specifies the vCenter Datacenter for the control plane.
Specifies the vCenter Datastore for the control plane.
Specifies the path to the vSphere VM folder in vCenter, such as /dc1/vm/user-inst-5ddjd.
Specifies the vSphere resource pool for your VMs.
Specifies the vCenter server IP or fully qualified domain name.

## Sample VMware vSphere failure domain configuration

On VMware vSphere infrastructure, the cluster-wide infrastructure Custom Resource Definition (CRD), infrastructures.config.openshift.io, defines failure domains for your cluster.
The providerSpec in the ControlPlaneMachineSet custom resource (CR) specifies names for failure domains that the control plane machine set uses to ensure control plane nodes are deployed to the appropriate failure domain.
A failure domain is an infrastructure resource made up of a control plane machine set, a vCenter datacenter, vCenter datastore, and a network.

By using a failure domain resource, you can use a control plane machine set to deploy control plane machines on  separate clusters or datacenters.
A control plane machine set also balances control plane machines across defined failure domains to provide fault tolerance capabilities to your infrastructure.


[NOTE]
----
If you modify the ProviderSpec configuration in the ControlPlaneMachineSet CR, the control plane machine set updates all control plane machines deployed on the primary infrastructure and each failure domain infrastructure.
----


```yaml
apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1
kind: ControlPlaneMachineSet
metadata:
  name: cluster
  namespace: openshift-machine-api
spec:
# ...
  template:
# ...
    machines_v1beta1_machine_openshift_io:
      failureDomains: 1
        platform: VSphere
        vsphere: 2
        - name: <failure_domain_name1>
        - name: <failure_domain_name2>
# ...
```


A failure domain defines the vCenter location for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster nodes.
Defines failure domains by name for the control plane machine set.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Currently, the vsphere.name field is the only supported failure domain field that you can specify in the ControlPlaneMachineSet CR.
Each failureDomains.platform.vsphere.name field value in the ControlPlaneMachineSet CR must match the corresponding value defined in the failureDomains.name field of the cluster-wide infrastructure CRD.
You can find the value of the failureDomains.name field by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get infrastructure cluster -o=jsonpath={.spec.platformSpec.vsphere.failureDomains[0].name
```

----

For an example of a cluster-wide infrastructure CRD that defines resources for each failure domain, see "Specifying multiple regions and zones for your cluster on vSphere."

# Enabling VMware vSphere features for control plane machines

You can enable features by updating values in the control plane machine set.

## Adding tags to machines by using machine sets

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform adds a cluster-specific tag to each virtual machine (VM) that it creates.
The installation program uses these tags to select the VMs to delete when uninstalling a cluster.

In addition to the cluster-specific tags assigned to VMs, you can configure a machine set to add up to 10 additional vSphere tags to the VMs it provisions.

* You have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster installed on vSphere using an account with cluster-admin permissions.
* You have access to the VMware vCenter console associated with your cluster.
* You have created a tag in the vCenter console.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

1. Use the vCenter console to find the tag ID for any tag that you want to add to your machines:
1. Log in to the vCenter console.
2. From the Home menu, click Tags & Custom Attributes.
3. Select a tag that you want to add to your machines.
4. Use the browser URL for the tag that you select to identify the tag ID.
Example tag URL

```text
https://vcenter.example.com/ui/app/tags/tag/urn:vmomi:InventoryServiceTag:208e713c-cae3-4b7f-918e-4051ca7d1f97:GLOBAL/permissions
```

Example tag ID

```text
urn:vmomi:InventoryServiceTag:208e713c-cae3-4b7f-918e-4051ca7d1f97:GLOBAL
```

2. In a text editor, open the YAML file for an existing machine set or create a new one.
3. Edit the following lines under the providerSpec field:

```yaml
apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1
kind: ControlPlaneMachineSet
# ...
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      providerSpec:
        value:
          tagIDs: 1
          - <tag_id_value> 2
# ...
```

Specify a list of up to 10 tags to add to the machines that this machine set provisions.
Specify the value of the tag that you want to add to your machines.
For example, urn:vmomi:InventoryServiceTag:208e713c-cae3-4b7f-918e-4051ca7d1f97:GLOBAL.
