# High-availability or single-node cluster detection and support


An OpenShift Container Platform cluster can be configured in high-availability (HA) mode, which uses multiple nodes, or in non-HA mode, which uses a single node. A single-node cluster, also known as single-node OpenShift, is likely to have more conservative resource constraints. Therefore, it is important that Operators installed on a single-node cluster can adjust accordingly and still run well.
By accessing the cluster high-availability mode API provided in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, Operator authors can use the Operator SDK to enable their Operator to detect a cluster's infrastructure topology, either HA or non-HA mode. Custom Operator logic can be developed that uses the detected cluster topology to automatically switch the resource requirements, both for the Operator and for any Operands or workloads it manages, to a profile that best fits the topology.

----
The Red Hat-supported version of the Operator SDK CLI tool, including the related scaffolding and testing tools for Operator projects, is deprecated and is planned to be removed in a future release of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. Red Hat will provide bug fixes and support for this feature during the current release lifecycle, but this feature will no longer receive enhancements and will be removed from future Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform releases.
The Red Hat-supported version of the Operator SDK is not recommended for creating new Operator projects. Operator authors with existing Operator projects can use the version of the Operator SDK CLI tool released with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18 to maintain their projects and create Operator releases targeting newer versions of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
The following related base images for Operator projects are not deprecated. The runtime functionality and configuration APIs for these base images are still supported for bug fixes and for addressing CVEs.
* The base image for Ansible-based Operator projects
* The base image for Helm-based Operator projects
For the most recent list of major functionality that has been deprecated or removed within Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, refer to the Deprecated and removed features section of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release notes.
For information about the unsupported, community-maintained, version of the Operator SDK, see Operator SDK (Operator Framework).

# About the cluster high-availability mode API

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform provides a cluster high-availability mode API that can be used by Operators to help detect infrastructure topology. The Infrastructure API holds cluster-wide information regarding infrastructure. Operators managed by Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) can use the Infrastructure API if they need to configure an Operand or managed workload differently based on the high-availability mode.

In the Infrastructure API, the infrastructureTopology status expresses the expectations for infrastructure services that do not run on control plane nodes, usually indicated by a node selector for a role value other than master. The controlPlaneTopology status expresses the expectations for Operands that normally run on control plane nodes.

The default setting for either status is HighlyAvailable, which represents the behavior Operators have in multiple node clusters. The SingleReplica setting is used in single-node clusters, also known as single-node OpenShift, and indicates that Operators should not configure their Operands for high-availability operation.

The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installer sets the controlPlaneTopology and infrastructureTopology status fields based on the replica counts for the cluster when it is created, according to the following rules:

* When the control plane replica count is less than 3, the controlPlaneTopology status is set to SingleReplica. Otherwise, it is set to HighlyAvailable.
* When the worker replica count is 0, the control plane nodes are also configured as workers. Therefore, the infrastructureTopology status will be the same as the controlPlaneTopology status.
* When the worker replica count is 1, the infrastructureTopology is set to SingleReplica. Otherwise, it is set to HighlyAvailable.

# Example API usage in Operator projects

As an Operator author, you can update your Operator project to access the Infrastructure API by using normal Kubernetes constructs and the controller-runtime library, as shown in the following examples:


```go
// Simple query
 nn := types.NamespacedName{
 Name: "cluster",
 }
 infraConfig := &configv1.Infrastructure{}
 err = crClient.Get(context.Background(), nn, infraConfig)
 if err != nil {
 return err
 }
 fmt.Printf("using crclient: %v\n", infraConfig.Status.ControlPlaneTopology)
 fmt.Printf("using crclient: %v\n", infraConfig.Status.InfrastructureTopology)
```



```go
operatorConfigInformer := configinformer.NewSharedInformerFactoryWithOptions(configClient, 2*time.Second)
 infrastructureLister = operatorConfigInformer.Config().V1().Infrastructures().Lister()
 infraConfig, err := configClient.ConfigV1().Infrastructures().Get(context.Background(), "cluster", metav1.GetOptions{})
 if err != nil {
 return err
 }
// fmt.Printf("%v\n", infraConfig)
 fmt.Printf("%v\n", infraConfig.Status.ControlPlaneTopology)
 fmt.Printf("%v\n", infraConfig.Status.InfrastructureTopology)
```
