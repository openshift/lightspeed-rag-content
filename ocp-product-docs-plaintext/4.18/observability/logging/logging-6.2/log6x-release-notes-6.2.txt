# Logging 6.2 Release Notes



# Logging 6.2.2 Release Notes

This release includes RHBA-2025:4526.

## Bug Fixes

* Before this update, logs without the responseStatus.code field caused parsing errors in the Loki distributor component. This happened when using the OpenTelemetry data model. With this update, logs without the responseStatus.code field are parsed correctly. (LOG-7012)
* Before this update, the Cloudwatch output supported log events up to 256 KB in size. With this update, the Cloudwatch output supports up to 1 MB in size to match the updates published by Amazon Web Services (AWS). (LOG-7013)
* Before this update, auditd log messages with multiple msg keys could cause errors in collector pods, because the standard auditd log format expects a single msg field per log entry that follows the msg=audit(TIMESTAMP:ID) structure. With this update, only the first msg value is used, which resolves the issue and ensures accurate extraction of audit metadata. (LOG-7014)
* Before this update, collector pods would enter a crash loop due to a configuration error when attempting token-based authentication with an Elasticsearch output. With this update, token authentication with an Elasticsearch output generates a valid configuration. (LOG-7017)

# Logging 6.2.1 Release Notes

This release includes RHBA-2025:3908.

## Bug Fixes

* Before this update, application programming interface (API) audit logs collected from the management cluster used the cluster_id value from the management cluster. With this update, API audit logs use the cluster_id value from the guest cluster. (LOG-4445)
* Before this update, issuing the oc explain obsclf.spec.filters command did not list all the supported filters in the command output. With this update, all the supported filter types are listed in the command output. (LOG-6753)
* Before this update the log collector flagged a ClusterLogForwarder resource with multiple inputs to a LokiStack output as invalid due to  incorrect internal processing logic. This update fixes the issue. (LOG-6758)
* Before this update, issuing the oc explain command for the clusterlogforwarder.spec.outputs.syslog resource returned an incomplete result. With this update, the missing supported types for rfc and enrichment attributes are listed in the result correctly. (LOG-6869)
* Before this update, empty OpenTelemetry (OTEL) tuning configuration caused validation errors. With this update, validation rules have been updated to accept empty tuning configuration. (LOG-6878)
* Before this update the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator could not update the securitycontextconstraint resource that is required by the log collector. With this update, the required cluster role has been provided to the service account of the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator. As a result of which, Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator can create or update the  securitycontextconstraint resource. (LOG-6879)
* Before this update, the API documentation for the  URL attribute of the syslog resource incorrectly mentioned the value udps as a supported value. With this update, all references to udps have been removed. (LOG-6896)
* Before this update, the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator was intermittently unable to update the object in logs due to update conflicts. This update resolves the issue and prevents conflicts during object updates by using the Patch() function instead of the Update() function. (LOG-6953)
* Before this update, Loki ingesters that got into an unhealthy state due to networking issues stayed in that state even after the network recovered. With this update, you can configure  the Loki Operator to perform service discovery more often so that unhealthy ingesters can rejoin the group. (LOG-6992)
* Before this update, the Vector collector could not forward Open Virtual Network (OVN) and Auditd logs. With this update, the Vector collector can forward OVN and Auditd logs. (LOG-6997)

# Logging 6.2.0 Release Notes

This release includes Logging for Red Hat OpenShift Bug Fix Release 6.2.0.

## New Features and Enhancements

### Log Collection

* With this update, HTTP outputs include a proxy field that you can use to send log data through an HTTP proxy. (LOG-6069)

### Log Storage

* With this update, time-based stream sharding in Loki is now enabled by the Loki Operator. This solves the issue of ingesting log entries older than the sliding time-window used by Loki. (LOG-6757)
* With this update, you can configure a custom certificate authority (CA) certificate with Loki Operator when using Swift as an object store. (LOG-4818)
* With this update, you can configure workload identity federation on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) by using the Cluster Credential Operator in OpenShift 4.17 and later releases with the Loki Operator. (LOG-6158)

## Technology Preview


[IMPORTANT]
----
{FeatureName} is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
----

* With this update, OpenTelemetry support offered by OpenShift Logging continues to improve, specifically in the area of enabling migrations from the ViaQ data model to OpenTelemetry when forwarding to LokiStack. (LOG-6146)
* With this update, the structuredMetadata field has been removed from Loki Operator in the otlp configuration because structured metadata is now the default type. Additionally, the update introduces a drop field that administrators can use to drop OpenTelemetry attributes when receiving data through OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP). (LOG-6507)

## Bug Fixes

* Before this update, the timestamp shown in the console logs did not match the @timestamp field in the message. With this update the timestamp is correctly shown in the console. (LOG-6222)
* The introduction of ClusterLogForwarder 6.x modified the ClusterLogForwarder API to allow for a consistent templating mechanism. However, this was not applied to the syslog output spec API for the facility and severity fields. This update adds the required validation to the ClusterLogForwarder API for the facility and severity fields. (LOG-6661)
* Before this update, an error in the Loki Operator generating the Loki configuration caused the amount of workers to delete to be zero when 1x.pico was set as the LokiStack size. With this update, the number of workers to delete is set to 10. (LOG-6781)

## Known Issues

* The previous data model encoded all information in JSON. The console still uses the query of the previous data model to decode both old and new entries. The logs that are stored by using the new OpenTelemetry data model for the LokiStack output display the following error in the logging console:

```
__error__ JSONParserErr
__error_details__ Value looks like object, but can't find closing '}' symbol
```


You can ignore the error as it is only a result of the query and not a data-related error. (LOG-6808)
* Currently, the API documentation incorrectly mentions OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP) attributes as included instead of excluded in the descriptions of the drop field. (LOG-6839).
