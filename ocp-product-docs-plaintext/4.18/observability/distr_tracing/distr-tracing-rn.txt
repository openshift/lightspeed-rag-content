----

### New features and enhancements

This update introduces the following enhancements:

* With this update, you can configure the Tempo backend services to report the internal tracing data by using the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP).
* With this update, the traces.span.metrics namespace becomes the default metrics namespace on which the Jaeger query retrieves the Prometheus metrics. The purpose of this change is to provide compatibility with the OpenTelemetry Collector version 0.109.0 and later where this namespace is the default. Customers who are still using an earlier OpenTelemetry Collector version can configure this namespace by adding the following field and value: spec.template.queryFrontend.jaegerQuery.monitorTab.redMetricsNamespace: "".

### Bug fixes

This update introduces the following bug fix:

* Before this update, the Tempo Operator failed when the TempoStack custom resource had the spec.storage.tls.enabled field set to true and used an Amazon S3 object store with the Security Token Service (STS) authentication. With this update, such a TempoStack custom resource configuration does not cause the Tempo Operator to fail.

### Known issues

The Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Tempo) 3.5 has the following known issue:

* Currently, when the OpenShift tenancy mode is enabled, the ServiceAccount object of the gateway component of a TempoStack or TempoMonolithic instance requires the TokenReview and SubjectAccessReview permissions for authorization.

* Before this update, the query frontend service of the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform was using internal mTLS when gateway was not deployed. This caused endpoint failure errors. This update fixes mTLS when Gateway is not deployed. (TRACING-3510)

### Known issues

There are currently known issues:

* Currently, when used with the Tempo Operator, the Jaeger UI only displays services that have sent traces in the last 15 minutes. For services that did not send traces in the last 15 minutes, traces are still stored but not displayed in the Jaeger UI. (TRACING-3139)
* Currently, the distributed tracing platform (Tempo) fails on the IBM Z (s390x) architecture. (TRACING-3545)

# Release notes for Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform 2.8

## Component versions in the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform 2.8



## Technology Preview features

This release introduces support for the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Tempo) as a Technology Preview feature for Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform.


[IMPORTANT]
----
{FeatureName} is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.
----

The feature uses version 0.1.0 of the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Tempo) and version 2.0.1 of the upstream distributed tracing platform (Tempo) components.

You can use the distributed tracing platform (Tempo) to replace Jaeger so that you can use S3-compatible storage instead of ElasticSearch.
Most users who use the distributed tracing platform (Tempo) instead of Jaeger will not notice any difference in functionality because the distributed tracing platform (Tempo) supports the same ingestion and query protocols as Jaeger and uses the same user interface.

If you enable this Technology Preview feature, note the following limitations of the current implementation:

* The distributed tracing platform (Tempo) currently does not support disconnected installations. (TRACING-3145)
* When you use the Jaeger user interface (UI) with the distributed tracing platform (Tempo), the Jaeger UI lists only services that have sent traces within the last 15 minutes. For services that have not sent traces within the last 15 minutes, those traces are still stored even though they are not visible in the Jaeger UI. (TRACING-3139)

Expanded support for the Tempo Operator is planned for future releases of the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform.
Possible additional features might include support for TLS authentication, multitenancy, and multiple clusters.
For more information about the Tempo Operator, see the Tempo community documentation.
