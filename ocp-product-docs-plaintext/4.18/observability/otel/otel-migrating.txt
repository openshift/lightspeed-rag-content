# Migrating



[IMPORTANT]
----
The Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) is a deprecated feature. Deprecated functionality is still included in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and continues to be supported; however, it will be removed in a future release of this product and is not recommended for new deployments.
For the most recent list of major functionality that has been deprecated or removed within Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, refer to the Deprecated and removed features section of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release notes.
----
If you are already using the Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) for your applications, you can migrate to the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry, which is based on the OpenTelemetry open-source project.
The Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry provides a set of APIs, libraries, agents, and instrumentation to facilitate observability in distributed systems. The OpenTelemetry Collector in the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry can ingest the Jaeger protocol, so you do not need to change the SDKs in your applications.
Migration from the distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) to the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry requires configuring the OpenTelemetry Collector and your applications to report traces seamlessly. You can migrate sidecar and sidecarless deployments.

# Migrating with sidecars

The Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry Operator supports sidecar injection into deployment workloads, so you can migrate from a distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) sidecar to a Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry sidecar.

* The Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) is used on the cluster.
* The Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry is installed.

1. Configure the OpenTelemetry Collector as a sidecar.

```yaml
apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpenTelemetryCollector
metadata:
  name: otel
  namespace: <otel-collector-namespace>
spec:
  mode: sidecar
  config: |
    receivers:
      jaeger:
        protocols:
          grpc: {}
          thrift_binary: {}
          thrift_compact: {}
          thrift_http: {}
    processors:
      batch: {}
      memory_limiter:
        check_interval: 1s
        limit_percentage: 50
        spike_limit_percentage: 30
      resourcedetection:
        detectors: [openshift]
        timeout: 2s
    exporters:
      otlp:
        endpoint: "tempo-<example>-gateway:8090" 1
        tls:
          insecure: true
    service:
      pipelines:
        traces:
          receivers: [jaeger]
          processors: [memory_limiter, resourcedetection, batch]
          exporters: [otlp]
```

This endpoint points to the Gateway of a TempoStack instance deployed by using the <example> Tempo Operator.
2. Create a service account for running your application.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: otel-collector-sidecar
```

3. Create a cluster role for the permissions needed by some processors.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: otel-collector-sidecar
rules:
  1
- apiGroups: ["config.openshift.io"]
  resources: ["infrastructures", "infrastructures/status"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
```

The resourcedetectionprocessor requires permissions for infrastructures and infrastructures/status.
4. Create a ClusterRoleBinding to set the permissions for the service account.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: otel-collector-sidecar
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: otel-collector-deployment
  namespace: otel-collector-example
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: otel-collector
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

5. Deploy the OpenTelemetry Collector as a sidecar.
6. Remove the injected Jaeger Agent from your application by removing the "sidecar.jaegertracing.io/inject": "true" annotation from your Deployment object.
7. Enable automatic injection of the OpenTelemetry sidecar by adding the sidecar.opentelemetry.io/inject: "true" annotation to the .spec.template.metadata.annotations field of your Deployment object.
8. Use the created service account for the deployment of your application to allow the processors to get the correct information and add it to your traces.

# Migrating without sidecars

You can migrate from the distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) to the Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry without sidecar deployment.

* The Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (Jaeger) is used on the cluster.
* The Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry is installed.

1. Configure OpenTelemetry Collector deployment.
2. Create the project where the OpenTelemetry Collector will be deployed.

```yaml
apiVersion: project.openshift.io/v1
kind: Project
metadata:
  name: observability
```

3. Create a service account for running the OpenTelemetry Collector instance.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: otel-collector-deployment
  namespace: observability
```

4. Create a cluster role for setting the required permissions for the processors.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: otel-collector
rules:
  1
  2
- apiGroups: ["", "config.openshift.io"]
  resources: ["pods", "namespaces", "infrastructures", "infrastructures/status"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
```

Permissions for the pods and namespaces resources are required for the k8sattributesprocessor.
Permissions for infrastructures and infrastructures/status are required for resourcedetectionprocessor.
5. Create a ClusterRoleBinding to set the permissions for the service account.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: otel-collector
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: otel-collector-deployment
  namespace: observability
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: otel-collector
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

6. Create the OpenTelemetry Collector instance.

[NOTE]
----
This collector will export traces to a TempoStack instance. You must create your TempoStack instance by using the Red Hat Tempo Operator and place here the correct endpoint.
----

```yaml
apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpenTelemetryCollector
metadata:
  name: otel
  namespace: observability
spec:
  mode: deployment
  serviceAccount: otel-collector-deployment
  config: |
    receivers:
      jaeger:
        protocols:
          grpc: {}
          thrift_binary: {}
          thrift_compact: {}
          thrift_http: {}
    processors:
      batch: {}
      k8sattributes:
      memory_limiter:
        check_interval: 1s
        limit_percentage: 50
        spike_limit_percentage: 30
      resourcedetection:
        detectors: [openshift]
    exporters:
      otlp:
        endpoint: "tempo-example-gateway:8090"
        tls:
          insecure: true
    service:
      pipelines:
        traces:
          receivers: [jaeger]
          processors: [memory_limiter, k8sattributes, resourcedetection, batch]
          exporters: [otlp]
```

7. Point your tracing endpoint to the OpenTelemetry Operator.
8. If you are exporting your traces directly from your application to Jaeger, change the API endpoint from the Jaeger endpoint to the OpenTelemetry Collector endpoint.
Example of exporting traces by using the jaegerexporter with Golang

```golang
exp, err := jaeger.New(jaeger.WithCollectorEndpoint(jaeger.WithEndpoint(url))) 1
```

The URL points to the OpenTelemetry Collector API endpoint.
