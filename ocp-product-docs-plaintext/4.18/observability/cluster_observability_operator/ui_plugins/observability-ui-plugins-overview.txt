# Observability UI plugins overview


You can use the Cluster Observability Operator (COO) to install and manage UI plugins to enhance the observability capabilities of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.
The plugins extend the default functionality, providing new UI features for troubleshooting, distributed tracing, and cluster logging.

# Monitoring

The monitoring UI plugin adds monitoring related UI features to the OpenShift web console, for the Advance Cluster Management (ACM) perspective and for incident detection.

* ACM: The monitoring plugin in Cluster Observability Operator (COO) allows it to function in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) environments, providing ACM with the same monitoring capabilities as Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
* Incident Detection: The incident detection feature groups alerts into incidents to help you identify the root causes of alert bursts instead of being overwhelmed by individual alerts. It presents a timeline of incidents, color-coded by severity, and you can drill down into the individual alerts within an incident. The system also categorizes alerts by affected component to help you focus on the most critical areas first.

For more information, see the monitoring UI plugin page.

# Cluster logging

The logging UI plugin surfaces logging data in the web console on the  Observe &#8594; Logs page.
You can specify filters, queries, time ranges and refresh rates. The results displayed a list of collapsed logs, which can then be expanded to show more detailed information for each log.

For more information, see the logging UI plugin page.

The troubleshooting panel UI plugin for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.16+ provides observability signal correlation, powered by the open source Korrel8r project.
You can use the troubleshooting panel available from the Observe &#8594; Alerting page to easily correlate metrics, logs, alerts, netflows, and additional observability signals and resources, across different data stores.
Users of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.17+ can also access the troubleshooting UI panel from the Application Launcher .

The output of Korrel8r is displayed as an interactive node graph. When you click on a node, you are automatically redirected to the corresponding web console page with the specific information for that node, for example, metric, log, or pod.

The distributed tracing UI plugin adds tracing-related features to the web console on the Observe &#8594; Traces page.
You can follow requests through the front end and into the backend of microservices, helping you identify code errors and performance bottlenecks in distributed systems.
You can select a supported TempoStack or TempoMonolithic multi-tenant instance running in the cluster and set a time range and query to view the trace data.
