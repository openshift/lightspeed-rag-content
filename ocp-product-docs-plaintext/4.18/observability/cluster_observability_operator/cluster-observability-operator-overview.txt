# Cluster Observability Operator overview



The Cluster Observability Operator (COO) is an optional component of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform designed for creating and managing highly customizable monitoring stacks. It enables cluster administrators to automate configuration and management of monitoring needs extensively, offering a more tailored and detailed view of each namespace compared to the default Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring system.

The standalone COO documentation is available at https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_cluster_observability_operator/1-latest/html/about_red_hat_openshift_cluster_observability_operator/index.
