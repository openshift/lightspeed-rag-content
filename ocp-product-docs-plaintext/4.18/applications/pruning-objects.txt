# Pruning objects to reclaim resources


Over time, API objects created in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform can accumulate in the
cluster's etcd data store through normal user operations, such as when building
and deploying applications.
Cluster administrators can periodically prune older versions of objects from the
cluster that are no longer required. For example, by pruning images you can delete
older images and layers that are no longer in use, but are still taking up disk
space.

# Basic pruning operations

The CLI groups prune operations under a common parent command:


```terminal
$ oc adm prune <object_type> <options>
```


This specifies:

* The <object_type> to perform the action on, such as groups, builds,
deployments, or images.
* The <options> supported to prune that object type.

# Pruning groups

To prune groups records from an external provider, administrators can run the
following command:


```terminal
$ oc adm prune groups \
    --sync-config=path/to/sync/config [<options>]
```




1. To see the groups that the prune command deletes, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc adm prune groups --sync-config=ldap-sync-config.yaml
```

2. To perform the prune operation, add the --confirm flag:

```terminal
$ oc adm prune groups --sync-config=ldap-sync-config.yaml --confirm
```


# Pruning deployment resources

You can prune resources associated with deployments that are no longer required by the system, due to age and status.

The following command prunes replication controllers associated with DeploymentConfig objects:


```terminal
$ oc adm prune deployments [<options>]
```



[NOTE]
----
To also prune replica sets associated with Deployment objects, use the --replica-sets flag. This flag is currently a Technology Preview feature.
----



1. To see what a pruning operation would delete, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc adm prune deployments --orphans --keep-complete=5 --keep-failed=1 \
    --keep-younger-than=60m
```

2. To actually perform the prune operation, add the --confirm flag:

```terminal
$ oc adm prune deployments --orphans --keep-complete=5 --keep-failed=1 \
    --keep-younger-than=60m --confirm
```


# Pruning builds

To prune builds that are no longer required by the system due to age and status, administrators can run the following command:


```terminal
$ oc adm prune builds [<options>]
```




1. To see what a pruning operation would delete, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc adm prune builds --orphans --keep-complete=5 --keep-failed=1 \
    --keep-younger-than=60m
```

2. To actually perform the prune operation, add the --confirm flag:

```terminal
$ oc adm prune builds --orphans --keep-complete=5 --keep-failed=1 \
    --keep-younger-than=60m --confirm
```



[NOTE]
----
Developers can enable automatic build pruning by modifying their build configuration.

# Automatically pruning images

Images from the OpenShift image registry that are no longer required by the system due to age, status, or exceed limits are automatically pruned. Cluster administrators can configure the Pruning Custom Resource, or suspend it.

* You have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster using an account with cluster administrator permissions.
* Install the oc CLI.

* Verify that the object named imagepruners.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster contains the following spec and status fields:


```yaml
spec:
  schedule: 0 0 * * * 1
  suspend: false 2
  keepTagRevisions: 3 3

```


schedule: CronJob formatted schedule. This is an optional field, default is daily at midnight.
suspend: If set to true, the CronJob running pruning is suspended. This is an optional field, default is false. The initial value on new clusters is false.
keepTagRevisions: The number of revisions per tag to keep. This is an optional field, default is 3. The initial value is 3.
keepYoungerThanDuration: Retain images younger than this duration. This is an optional field. If a value is not specified, either keepYoungerThan or the default value 60m (60 minutes) is used.
keepYoungerThan: Deprecated. The same as keepYoungerThanDuration, but the duration is specified as an integer in nanoseconds. This is an optional field. When keepYoungerThanDuration is set, this field is ignored.
resources: Standard pod resource requests and limits. This is an optional field.
affinity: Standard pod affinity. This is an optional field.
nodeSelector: Standard pod node selector. This is an optional field.
tolerations: Standard pod tolerations. This is an optional field.
successfulJobsHistoryLimit: The maximum number of successful jobs to retain. Must be >= 1 to ensure metrics are reported. This is an optional field, default is 3. The initial value is 3.
failedJobsHistoryLimit: The maximum number of failed jobs to retain. Must be >= 1 to ensure metrics are reported. This is an optional field, default is 3. The initial value is 3.
observedGeneration: The generation observed by the Operator.
conditions: The standard condition objects with the following types:
* Available: Indicates if the pruning job has been created. Reasons can be Ready or Error.
* Scheduled: Indicates if the next pruning job has been scheduled. Reasons can be Scheduled, Suspended, or Error.
* Failed: Indicates if the most recent pruning job failed.


[IMPORTANT]
----
The Image Registry Operator's behavior for managing the pruner is orthogonal to the managementState specified on the Image Registry Operator's ClusterOperator object. If the Image Registry Operator is not in the Managed state, the image pruner can still be configured and managed by the Pruning Custom Resource.
However, the managementState of the Image Registry Operator alters the behavior of the deployed image pruner job:
* Managed: the --prune-registry flag for the image pruner is set to true.
* Removed: the --prune-registry flag for the image pruner is set to false, meaning it only prunes image metadata in etcd.
----

# Manually pruning images

The pruning custom resource enables automatic image pruning for the images from the OpenShift image registry. However, administrators can manually prune images that are no longer required by the system due to age, status, or exceed limits. There are two methods to manually prune images:

* Running image pruning as a Job or CronJob on the cluster.
* Running the oc adm prune images command.

* To prune images, you must first log in to the CLI as a user with an access token. The user must also have the system:image-pruner cluster role or greater (for example, cluster-admin).
* Expose the image registry.

To manually prune images that are no longer required by the system due to age, status, or exceed limits, use one of the following methods:

* Run image pruning as a Job or CronJob on the cluster by creating a YAML file for the pruner service account, for example:

```terminal
$ oc create -f <filename>.yaml
```

              - prune
              - images

              - --confirm=true
              name: image-pruner
            serviceAccountName: pruner
```

* Run the oc adm prune images [<options>] command:

```terminal
$ oc adm prune images [<options>]
```


Pruning images removes data from the integrated registry unless --prune-registry=false is used.

Pruning images with the --namespace flag does not remove images, only image streams. Images are non-namespaced resources. Therefore, limiting pruning to a particular namespace makes it impossible to calculate its current usage.

By default, the integrated registry caches metadata of blobs to reduce the number of requests to storage, and to increase the request-processing speed. Pruning does not update the integrated registry cache. Images that still contain pruned layers after pruning will be broken because the pruned layers that have metadata in the cache will not be pushed. Therefore, you must redeploy the registry to clear the cache after pruning:

```terminal
$ oc rollout restart deployment/image-registry -n openshift-image-registry
```


If the integrated registry uses a Redis cache, you must clean the database manually.

If redeploying the registry after pruning is not an option, then you must permanently disable the cache.

oc adm prune images operations require a route for your registry. Registry routes are not created by default.

The Prune images CLI configuration options table describes the options you can use with the oc adm prune images <options> command.
Prune images CLI configuration options


## Image prune conditions

You can apply conditions to your manually pruned images.

* To remove any image managed by Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, or images with the annotation openshift.io/image.managed:
* Created at least --keep-younger-than minutes ago and are not currently referenced by any:
* Pods created less than --keep-younger-than minutes ago
* Image streams created less than --keep-younger-than minutes ago
* Running pods
* Pending pods
* Replication controllers
* Deployments
* Deployment configs
* Replica sets
* Build configurations
* Builds
* Jobs
* Cronjobs
* Stateful sets
* --keep-tag-revisions most recent items in stream.status.tags[].items
* That are exceeding the smallest limit defined in the same project and are not currently referenced by any:
* Running pods
* Pending pods
* Replication controllers
* Deployments
* Deployment configs
* Replica sets
* Build configurations
* Builds
* Jobs
* Cronjobs
* Stateful sets
* There is no support for pruning from external registries.
* When an image is pruned, all references to the image are removed from all
image streams that have a reference to the image in status.tags.
* Image layers that are no longer referenced by any images are removed.


[NOTE]
----
The --prune-over-size-limit flag cannot be combined with the --keep-tag-revisions flag nor the --keep-younger-than flags. Doing so returns
information that this operation is not allowed.
----

Separating the removal of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform image API objects and image data from the registry by using --prune-registry=false, followed by hard pruning the registry, can narrow timing windows and is safer when compared to trying to prune both through one command. However, timing windows are not completely removed.

For example, you can still create a pod referencing an image as pruning identifies that image for pruning. You should still keep track of an API object created during the pruning operations that might reference images so that you can mitigate any references to deleted content.

Re-doing the pruning without the --prune-registry option or with --prune-registry=true does not lead to pruning the associated storage in the image registry for images previously pruned by --prune-registry=false. Any images that were pruned with --prune-registry=false can only be deleted from registry storage by hard pruning the registry.

## Running the image prune operation

1. To see what a pruning operation would delete:
1. Keeping up to three tag revisions, and keeping resources (images, image streams, and pods) younger than 60 minutes:

```terminal
$ oc adm prune images --keep-tag-revisions=3 --keep-younger-than=60m
```

2. Pruning every image that exceeds defined limits:

```terminal
$ oc adm prune images --prune-over-size-limit
```

2. To perform the prune operation with the options from the previous step:

```terminal
$ oc adm prune images --keep-tag-revisions=3 --keep-younger-than=60m --confirm
```


```terminal
$ oc adm prune images --prune-over-size-limit --confirm
```


## Using secure or insecure connections

The secure connection is the preferred and recommended approach. It is done over
HTTPS protocol with a mandatory certificate verification. The prune command
always attempts to use it if possible. If it is not possible, in some cases it
can fall-back to insecure connection, which is dangerous. In this case, either
certificate verification is skipped or plain HTTP protocol is used.

The fall-back to insecure connection is allowed in the following cases unless
--certificate-authority is specified:

1. The prune command is run with the --force-insecure option.
2. The provided registry-url is prefixed with the http:// scheme.
3. The provided registry-url is a local-link address or localhost.
4. The configuration of the current user allows for an insecure connection. This
can be caused by the user either logging in using --insecure-skip-tls-verify
or choosing the insecure connection when prompted.


[IMPORTANT]
----
If the registry is secured by a certificate authority different from the one used by Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, it must be specified using the
--certificate-authority flag. Otherwise, the prune command fails with an error.
----

## Image pruning problems

### Images not being pruned

If your images keep accumulating and the prune command removes just a small
portion of what you expect, ensure that you understand the image prune
conditions that must apply for an image to be considered a candidate for
pruning.

Ensure that images you want removed occur at higher positions in each tag
history than your chosen tag revisions threshold. For example, consider an old
and obsolete image named sha256:abz. By running the following command in your
namespace, where the image is tagged, the image is tagged three times in a
single image stream named myapp:


```terminal
$ oc get is -n <namespace> -o go-template='{{range $isi, $is := .items}}{{range $ti, $tag := $is.status.tags}}'\
'{{range $ii, $item := $tag.items}}{{if eq $item.image "sha256:<hash>"}}{{$is.metadata.name}}:{{$tag.tag}} at position {{$ii}} out of {{len $tag.items}}\n'\
'{{end}}{{end}}{{end}}{{end}}'
```



```terminal
myapp:v2 at position 4 out of 5
myapp:v2.1 at position 2 out of 2
myapp:v2.1-may-2016 at position 0 out of 1
```


When default options are used, the image is never pruned because it occurs at
position 0 in a history of myapp:v2.1-may-2016 tag. For an image to be
considered for pruning, the administrator must either:

* Specify --keep-tag-revisions=0 with the oc adm prune images command.

[WARNING]
----
This action removes all the tags from all the namespaces with underlying images, unless they are younger or they are referenced by objects younger than the specified threshold.
----
* Delete all the istags where the position is below the revision threshold,
which means myapp:v2.1 and myapp:v2.1-may-2016.
* Move the image further in the history, either by running new builds pushing to
the same istag, or by tagging other image. This is not always
desirable for old release tags.

Tags having a date or time of a particular image&#8217;s build in their names should
be avoided, unless the image must be preserved for an undefined amount of time.
Such tags tend to have just one image in their history, which prevents
them from ever being pruned.

### Using a secure connection against insecure registry

If you see a message similar to the following in the output of the oc adm prune images
command, then your registry is not secured and the oc adm prune images
client attempts to use a secure connection:


```terminal
error: error communicating with registry: Get https://172.30.30.30:5000/healthz: http: server gave HTTP response to HTTPS client
```


* The recommended solution is to secure the registry. Otherwise, you can force the
client to use an insecure connection by appending --force-insecure  to the
command; however, this is not recommended.

### Using an insecure connection against a secured registry

If you see one of the following errors in the output of the oc adm prune images
command, it means that your registry is secured using a certificate signed by a
certificate authority other than the one used by oc adm prune images client for
connection verification:


```terminal
error: error communicating with registry: Get http://172.30.30.30:5000/healthz: malformed HTTP response "\x15\x03\x01\x00\x02\x02"
error: error communicating with registry: [Get https://172.30.30.30:5000/healthz: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority, Get http://172.30.30.30:5000/healthz: malformed HTTP response "\x15\x03\x01\x00\x02\x02"]
```


By default, the certificate authority data stored in the user&#8217;s configuration files is used; the same is true for communication with the master API.

Use the --certificate-authority option to provide the right certificate authority for the container image registry server.

### Using the wrong certificate authority

The following error means that the certificate authority used to sign the certificate of the secured container image registry is different from the authority used by the client:


```terminal
error: error communicating with registry: Get https://172.30.30.30:5000/: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
```


Make sure to provide the right one with the flag --certificate-authority.

As a workaround, the --force-insecure flag can be added instead. However, this is not recommended.

# Hard pruning the registry

The OpenShift Container Registry can accumulate blobs that are not referenced by
the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster&#8217;s etcd. The basic pruning images procedure,
therefore, is unable to operate on them. These are called orphaned blobs.

Orphaned blobs can occur from the following scenarios:

* Manually deleting an image with oc delete image <sha256:image-id> command,
which only removes the image from etcd, but not from the registry's storage.
* Pushing to the registry initiated by daemon failures, which causes some blobs to
get uploaded, but the image manifest (which is uploaded as the very last
component) does not. All unique image blobs become orphans.
* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform refusing an image because of quota restrictions.
* The standard image pruner deleting an image manifest, but is interrupted before
it deletes the related blobs.
* A bug in the registry pruner, which fails to remove the intended blobs, causing
the image objects referencing them to be removed and the blobs becoming orphans.

Hard pruning the registry, a separate procedure from basic image pruning,
allows cluster administrators to remove orphaned blobs. You should hard prune if
you are running out of storage space in your OpenShift Container Registry and
believe you have orphaned blobs.

This should be an infrequent operation and is necessary only when you have
evidence that significant numbers of new orphans have been created. Otherwise,
you can perform standard image pruning at regular intervals, for example, once a
day (depending on the number of images being created).

To hard prune orphaned blobs from the registry:

1. Log in.

Log in to the cluster with the CLI as kubeadmin or another privileged user that
has access to the openshift-image-registry namespace.
2. Run a basic image prune.

Basic image pruning removes additional images that are no longer needed. The
hard prune does not remove images on its own. It only removes blobs stored in
the registry storage. Therefore, you should run this just before the hard prune.
3. Switch the registry to read-only mode.

If the registry is not running in read-only mode, any pushes happening at the
same time as the prune will either:
* fail and cause new orphans, or
* succeed although the images cannot be pulled (because some of the
referenced blobs were deleted).

Pushes will not succeed until the registry is switched back to read-write mode.
Therefore, the hard prune must be carefully scheduled.

To switch the registry to read-only mode:
1. In configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster, set spec.readOnly to true:

```terminal
$ oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster -p '{"spec":{"readOnly":true}}' --type=merge
```

4. Add the system:image-pruner role.

The service account used to run the registry instances requires additional
permissions to list some resources.
1. Get the service account name:

```terminal
$ service_account=$(oc get -n openshift-image-registry \
    -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.serviceAccountName}' deploy/image-registry)
```

2. Add the system:image-pruner cluster role to the service account:

```terminal
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user \
    system:image-pruner -z \
    ${service_account} -n openshift-image-registry
```

5. Optional: Run the pruner in dry-run mode.

To see how many blobs would be removed, run the hard pruner in dry-run mode. No changes are actually made. The following example references an image registry pod called image-registry-3-vhndw:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-image-registry exec pod/image-registry-3-vhndw -- /bin/sh -c '/usr/bin/dockerregistry -prune=check'
```


Alternatively, to get the exact paths for the prune candidates, increase the
logging level:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-image-registry exec pod/image-registry-3-vhndw -- /bin/sh -c 'REGISTRY_LOG_LEVEL=info /usr/bin/dockerregistry -prune=check'
```

Example output

```terminal

6. Run the hard prune.

Execute the following command inside one running instance of a image-registry pod to run the hard prune. The following example references an image registry pod called image-registry-3-vhndw:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-image-registry exec pod/image-registry-3-vhndw -- /bin/sh -c '/usr/bin/dockerregistry -prune=delete'
```

Example output

```terminal
Deleted 13374 blobs
Freed up 2.835 GiB of disk space
```

7. Switch the registry back to read-write mode.

After the prune is finished, the registry can be switched back to read-write
mode. In configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster, set
spec.readOnly to false:

```terminal
$ oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster -p '{"spec":{"readOnly":false}}' --type=merge
```


# Pruning cron jobs

Cron jobs can perform pruning of successful jobs, but might not properly handle
failed jobs. Therefore, the cluster administrator should perform regular cleanup of
jobs manually. They should also restrict the access to cron jobs to a small
group of trusted users and set appropriate quota to prevent the cron job from
creating too many jobs and pods.

* Running tasks in pods using jobs
* Resource quotas across multiple projects
* Using RBAC to define and apply permissions
