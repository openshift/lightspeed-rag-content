# Enabling remote health reporting


If you or your organization have disabled remote health reporting, you can enable this feature again. You can see that remote health reporting is disabled from the message "Insights not available" in the Status tile on the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Web Console Overview page.
To enable remote health reporting, you must Modify the global cluster pull secret with a new authorization token.

# Modifying your global cluster pull secret to enable remote health reporting

You can modify your existing global cluster pull secret to enable remote health reporting. If you have previously disabled remote health monitoring, you must first download a new pull secret with your console.openshift.com access token from Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager.

* Access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* Access to OpenShift Cluster Manager.

1. Navigate to https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads.
2. From Tokens -> Pull Secret, click Download.

The file pull-secret.txt containing your cloud.openshift.com access token in JSON format downloads:

```json
{
  "auths": {
    "cloud.openshift.com": {
      "auth": "<your_token>",
      "email": "<email_address>"
    }
  }
}
```

3. Download the global cluster pull secret to your local file system.

```terminal
$ oc get secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config \
  --template='{{index .data ".dockerconfigjson" | base64decode}}' \
  > pull-secret
```

4. Make a backup copy of your pull secret.

```terminal
$ cp pull-secret pull-secret-backup
```

5. Open the pull-secret file in a text editor.
6. Append the cloud.openshift.com JSON entry from pull-secret.txt into auths.
7. Save the file.
8. Update the secret in your cluster.

```terminal
$ oc set data secret/pull-secret -n openshift-config \
  --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=pull-secret
```


It may take several minutes for the secret to update and your cluster to begin reporting.

1. Navigate to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Web Console Overview page.
2. Insights in the Status tile reports the number of issues found.
