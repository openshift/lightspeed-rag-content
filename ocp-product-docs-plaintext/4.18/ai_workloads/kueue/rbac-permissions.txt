# Configuring role-based permissions


The following procedures provide information about how you can configure role-based access control (RBAC) for your Red Hat build of Kueue deployment. These RBAC permissions determine which types of users can create which types of Red Hat build of Kueue objects.

# Cluster roles

The Red&#160;Hat build of Kueue Operator deploys kueue-batch-admin-role and kueue-batch-user-role cluster roles by default.

kueue-batch-admin-role:: This cluster role includes the permissions to manage cluster queues, local queues, workloads, and resource flavors.
kueue-batch-user-role:: This cluster role includes the permissions to manage jobs and to view local queues and workloads.

# Configuring permissions for batch administrators

You can configure permissions for batch administrators by binding the kueue-batch-admin-role cluster role to a user or group of users.

* The Red Hat build of Kueue Operator is installed on your cluster.
* You have cluster administrator permissions.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

1. Create a ClusterRoleBinding object as a YAML file:
Example ClusterRoleBinding object

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: kueue-admins 1
subjects: 2
- kind: User
  name: admin@example.com
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef: 3
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: kueue-batch-admin-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

Provide a name for the ClusterRoleBinding object.
Add details about which user or group of users you want to provide user permissions for.
Add details about the kueue-batch-admin-role cluster role.
2. Apply the ClusterRoleBinding object:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
```


* You can verify that the ClusterRoleBinding object was applied correctly by running the following command and verifying that the output contains the correct information for the kueue-batch-admin-role cluster role:

```yaml
$ oc describe clusterrolebinding.rbac
```

Example output

```terminal
...
Name:         kueue-batch-admin-role
Labels:       app.kubernetes.io/name=kueue
Annotations:  <none>
Role:
  Kind:  ClusterRole
  Name:  kueue-batch-admin-role
Subjects:
  Kind            Name                      Namespace
  ----            ----                      ---------
  User            admin@example.com         admin-namespace
...
```


# Configuring permissions for users

You can configure permissions for Red&#160;Hat build of Kueue users by binding the kueue-batch-user-role cluster role to a user or group of users.

* The Red Hat build of Kueue Operator is installed on your cluster.
* You have cluster administrator permissions.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

1. Create a RoleBinding object as a YAML file:
Example ClusterRoleBinding object

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: kueue-users 1
  namespace: user-namespace 2
subjects: 3
- kind: Group
  name: team-a@example.com
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef: 4
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: kueue-batch-user-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

Provide a name for the RoleBinding object.
Add details about which namespace the RoleBinding object applies to.
Add details about which user or group of users you want to provide user permissions for.
Add details about the kueue-batch-user-role cluster role.
2. Apply the RoleBinding object:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
```


* You can verify that the RoleBinding object was applied correctly by running the following command and verifying that the output contains the correct information for the kueue-batch-user-role cluster role:

```yaml
$ oc describe rolebinding.rbac
```

Example output

```terminal
...
Name:         kueue-users
Labels:       app.kubernetes.io/name=kueue
Annotations:  <none>
Role:
  Kind:  ClusterRole
  Name:  kueue-batch-user-role
Subjects:
  Kind            Name                      Namespace
  ----            ----                      ---------
  Group           team-a@example.com        user-namespace
...
```
