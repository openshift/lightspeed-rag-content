# Red Hat OpenShift support for Windows Containers release notes



# Release notes for Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator 10.18.1

Issued: 27 May 2025

This release of the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) provides bug fixes for running Windows compute nodes in an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. The components of the WMCO 10.18.1 were released in RHSA-2025:8224.

## Bug fixes

* Previously, Windows nodes were unable to pull from image mirror registries if an organization name or namespace was included in the source of the ImageTagMirrorSet (ITMS) object. With this fix, you can include an organization name or namespace in the ITMS object. With this change, additional guidelines and requirements around using mirror registries have been added to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform documentation.
