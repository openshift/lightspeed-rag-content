# Red Hat OpenShift support for Windows Containers release notes



# Release notes for Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator 10.18.0

Issued: 19 March 2025

This release of the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) provides bug fixes for running Windows compute nodes in an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. The components of the WMCO 10.18.0 were released in RHBA-2025:3040.

## New features and improvements

### Horizontal Pod autoscaling is available for Windows workloads

You can now use a horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) to scale your Windows pods based on CPU and/or memory resource metrics. For more information on using an HPA, see Automatically scaling pods with the horizontal pod autoscaler.

### Control Plane Only updates are now available for Windows nodes

You can now use Control Plane Only updates, previously known as EUS-to-EUS updates, to update your Windows nodes between Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform EUS versions. For more information, see Windows Machine Config Operator Control Plane Only upgrade.

### WMCO metrics endpoint is now HTTPS

The WMCO metrics endpoint is now exposed over HTTPS. Previously, WMCO pod metrics were available over HTTP. This change improves the security posture of the WMCO metrics endpoint.

### WMCO now defaults to info-level logging

The WMCO is configured to use the info log level by default. You can change the log level to debug by editing the WMCO subscription object. For more information, see Configuring debug-level logging for the Windows Machine Config Operator.

### Kubernetes upgrade

The WMCO now uses Kubernetes 1.31.

## Bug fixes

* Previously, if you installed the WMCO into the the default openshift-windows-machine-config-operator namespace and removed the WMCO, subsequently installing the WMCO into a namespace other than the default would fail. This was because the role-based access control (RBAC) for the Windows Instance Config Daemon (WICD) was always associated with the default namespace. With this fix, when installing the WMCO to a non-default namespace, the RBAC for the WICD is configured correctly. (OCPBUGS-46473)
* Previously, the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform documentation lacked information about WMCO support for the installer-provisioned infrastructure and the user-provisioned infrastructure installation methods. With this fix, the documentation now reports that the installer-provisioned infrastructure method is the preferred installation method and can be used with all platforms. The user-provisioned infrastructure method is limited to specific use cases. For more information, see WMCO supported installation method. (OCPBUGS-18898)
