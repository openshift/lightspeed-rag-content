# Disabling Windows container workloads


You can disable the capability to run Windows container workloads by uninstalling the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) and deleting the namespace that was added by default when you installed the WMCO.

# Uninstalling the Windows Machine Config Operator

You can uninstall the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) from your cluster.

* Delete the Windows Machine objects hosting your Windows workloads.

1. From the Operators -> OperatorHub page, use the Filter by keyword box to search for Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator.
2. Click the Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator tile. The Operator tile indicates it is installed.
3. In the Windows Machine Config Operator descriptor page, click Uninstall.

# Deleting the Windows Machine Config Operator namespace

You can delete the namespace that was generated for the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) by default.

* The WMCO is removed from your cluster.

1. Remove all Windows workloads that were created in the openshift-windows-machine-config-operator namespace:

```terminal
$ oc delete --all pods --namespace=openshift-windows-machine-config-operator
```

2. Verify that all pods in the openshift-windows-machine-config-operator namespace are deleted or are reporting a terminating state:

```terminal
$ oc get pods --namespace openshift-windows-machine-config-operator
```

3. Delete the openshift-windows-machine-config-operator namespace:
