# Adding services to a service mesh


A project contains services; however, the services are only available if you add the project to the service mesh.

# About adding projects to a service mesh

After installing the Operators and creating the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource, add one or more projects to the service mesh.


[NOTE]
----
In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, a project is essentially a Kubernetes namespace with additional annotations, such as the range of user IDs that can be used in the project. Typically, the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console uses the term project, and the CLI uses the term namespace, but the terms are essentially synonymous.
----

You can add projects to an existing service mesh using either the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console or the CLI. There are three methods to add a project to a service mesh:

* Specifying the project name in the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource.
* Configuring label selectors in the spec.memberSelectors field of the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource.
* Creating the ServiceMeshMember resource in the project.

If you use the first method, then you must create the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource.

# Creating the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh member roll

The ServiceMeshMemberRoll lists the projects that belong to the Service Mesh control plane. Only projects listed in the ServiceMeshMemberRoll are affected by the control plane. A project does not belong to a service mesh until you add it to the member roll for a particular control plane deployment.

You must create a ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource named default in the same project as the ServiceMeshControlPlane, for example istio-system.

## Creating the member roll from the web console

You can add one or more projects to the Service Mesh member roll from the web console. In this example, istio-system is the name of the Service Mesh control plane project.

* An installed, verified Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator.
* List of existing projects to add to the service mesh.

1. Log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.
2. If you do not already have services for your mesh, or you are starting from scratch, create a project for your applications. It must be different from the project where you installed the Service Mesh control plane.
1. Navigate to Home -> Projects.
2. Enter a name in the Name field.
3. Click Create.
3. Navigate to Operators -> Installed Operators.
4. Click the Project menu and choose the project where your ServiceMeshControlPlane resource is deployed from the list, for example istio-system.
5. Click the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator.
6. Click the Istio Service Mesh Member Roll tab.
7. Click Create ServiceMeshMemberRoll
8. Click Members, then enter the name of your project in the Value field. You can add any number of projects, but a project can only belong to one ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource.
9. Click Create.

## Creating the member roll from the CLI

You can add a project to the ServiceMeshMemberRoll from the command line.

* An installed, verified Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator.
* List of projects to add to the service mesh.
* Access to the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI.

```terminal
$ oc login --username=<NAMEOFUSER> https://<HOSTNAME>:6443
```

2. If you do not already have services for your mesh, or you are starting from scratch, create a project for your applications. It must be different from the project where you installed the Service Mesh control plane.

```terminal
$ oc new-project <your-project>
```

3. To add your projects as members, modify the following example YAML. You can add any number of projects, but a project can only belong to one ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource. In this example, istio-system is the name of the Service Mesh control plane project.
Example servicemeshmemberroll-default.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
kind: ServiceMeshMemberRoll
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  members:
    # a list of projects joined into the service mesh
    - your-project-name
    - another-project-name
```

4. Run the following command to upload and create the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource in the istio-system namespace.

```terminal
$ oc create -n istio-system -f servicemeshmemberroll-default.yaml
```

5. Run the following command to verify the ServiceMeshMemberRoll was created successfully.

```terminal
$ oc get smmr -n istio-system default
```


The installation has finished successfully when the STATUS column is Configured.

# About adding projects using the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource

Using the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource is the simplest way to add a project to a service mesh. To add a project, specify the project name in the spec.members field of the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource. The ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource specifies which projects are controlled by the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource.

![Adding project using `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource image]


[NOTE]
----
Adding projects using this method requires the user to have the update servicemeshmemberrolls and the update pods privileges in the project that is being added.
----

* If you already have an application, workload, or service to add to the service mesh, see the following:
* Adding or removing projects from the mesh using the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource with the web console
* Adding or removing projects from the mesh using the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource with the CLI
* Alternatively, to install a sample application called Bookinfo and add it to a ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource, see the Bookinfo example application tutorial.

## Adding or removing projects from the mesh using the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource with the web console

You can add or remove projects from the mesh using the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource with the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console. You can add any number of projects, but a project can only belong to one mesh.

The ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource is deleted when its corresponding ServiceMeshControlPlane resource is deleted.

* An installed, verified Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator.
* An existing ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource.
* The name of the project with the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource.
* The names of the projects you want to add or remove from the mesh.

1. Log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.
2. Navigate to Operators -> Installed Operators.
3. Click the Project menu and choose the project where your ServiceMeshControlPlane resource is deployed from the list. For example istio-system.
4. Click the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator.
5. Click the Istio Service Mesh Member Roll tab.
6. Click the default link.
7. Click the YAML tab.
8. Modify the YAML to add projects as members (or delete them to remove existing members). You can add any number of projects, but a project can only belong to one ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource.
Example servicemeshmemberroll-default.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
kind: ServiceMeshMemberRoll
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: istio-system #control plane project
spec:
  members:
    # a list of projects joined into the service mesh
    - your-project-name
    - another-project-name
```

9. Click Save.
10. Click Reload.

## Adding or removing projects from the mesh using ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource with the CLI

You can add one or more projects to the mesh using the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource with the CLI. You can add any number of projects, but a project can only belong to one mesh.

The ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource is deleted when its corresponding ServiceMeshControlPlane resource is deleted.

* An installed, verified Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator.
* An existing ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource.
* The name of the project with the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource.
* The names of the projects you want to add or remove from the mesh.
* Access to the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI.
2. Edit the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource.

```terminal
$ oc edit smmr -n <controlplane-namespace>
```

3. Modify the YAML to add or remove projects as members. You can add any number of projects, but a project can only belong to one ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource.
Example servicemeshmemberroll-default.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
kind: ServiceMeshMemberRoll
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: istio-system #control plane project
spec:
  members:
    # a list of projects joined into the service mesh
    - your-project-name
    - another-project-name
```

4. Save the file and exit the editor.

# About adding projects using the ServiceMeshMember resource

A ServiceMeshMember resource provides a way to add a project to a service mesh without modifying the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource. To add a project, create a ServiceMeshMember resource in the project that you want to add to the service mesh. When the Service Mesh Operator processes the ServiceMeshMember object, the project appears in the status.members list of the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource. Then, the services that reside in the project are made available to the mesh.

![Adding project using `ServiceMeshMember` resource image]

The mesh administrator must grant each mesh user permission to reference the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource in the ServiceMeshMember resource. With this permission in place, a mesh user can add a project to a mesh even when that user does not have direct access rights for the service mesh project or the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource. For more information, see Creating the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh members.

## Adding a project to the mesh using the ServiceMeshMember resource with the web console

You can add one or more projects to the mesh using the ServiceMeshMember resource with the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

* You have installed the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator.
* You know the name of the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource and the name of the project that the resource belongs to.
* You know the name of the project you want to add to the mesh.
* A service mesh administrator must explicitly grant access to the service mesh. Administrators can grant users permissions to access the mesh by assigning them the mesh-user Role using a RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding. For more information, see Creating the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh members.

1. Log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.
2. Navigate to Operators -> Installed Operators.
3. Click the Project menu and choose the project that you want to add to the mesh from the drop-down list. For example, istio-system.
4. Click the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator.
5. Click the Istio Service Mesh Member tab.
6. Click Create ServiceMeshMember
7. Accept the default name for the ServiceMeshMember.
8. Click to expand ControlPlaneRef.
9. In the Namespace field, select the project that the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource belongs to. For example, istio-system.
10. In the Name field, enter the name of the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource that this namespace belongs to. For example, basic.
11. Click Create.

1. Confirm the ServiceMeshMember resource was created and that the project was added to the mesh by using the following steps:
1. Click the resource name, for example, default.
2. View the Conditions section shown at the end of the screen.
3. Confirm that the Status of the Reconciled and Ready conditions is True.

If the Status is False, see the Reason and Message columns for more information.

## Adding a project to the mesh using the ServiceMeshMember resource with the CLI

You can add one or more projects to the mesh using the ServiceMeshMember resource with the CLI.

* You have installed the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator.
* You know the name of the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource and the name of the project it belongs to.
* You know the name of the project you want to add to the mesh.
* A service mesh administrator must explicitly grant access to the service mesh. Administrators can grant users permissions to access the mesh by assigning them the mesh-user Role using a RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding. For more information, see Creating the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh members.

1. Log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI.
2. Create the YAML file for the ServiceMeshMember manifest. The manifest adds the my-application project to the service mesh that was created by the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource deployed in the istio-system namespace:

```yaml
apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
kind: ServiceMeshMember
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: my-application
spec:
  controlPlaneRef:
    namespace: istio-system
    name: basic
```

3. Apply the YAML file to create the ServiceMeshMember resource:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <file-name>
```


* Verify that the namespace is part of the mesh by running the following command. Confirm the that the value True appears in the READY column.

```terminal
$ oc get smm default -n my-application
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME      CONTROL PLANE        READY   AGE
default   istio-system/basic   True    2m11s
```

* Alternatively, view the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource to confirm that the my-application namespace is displayed in the status.members and status.configuredMembers fields of the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource.

```terminal
$ oc describe smmr default -n istio-system
```

Example output

```terminal
Name:         default
Namespace:    istio-system
Labels:       <none>
# ...
Status:
# ...
  Configured Members:
    default
    my-application
# ...
  Members:
    default
    my-application
```


# About adding projects using label selectors

For cluster-wide deployments, you can use label selectors to add projects to the mesh. Label selectors specified in the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource enable the Service Mesh Operator to add or remove namespaces to or from the mesh based on namespace labels. Unlike other standard Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform resources that you can use to specify a single label selector, you can use the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource to specify multiple label selectors.

![Adding project using label selector image]

If the labels for a namespace match any of the selectors specified in the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource, then the namespace is included in the mesh.


[NOTE]
----
In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, a project is essentially a Kubernetes namespace with additional annotations, such as the range of user IDs that can be used in the project. Typically, the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console uses the term project, and the CLI uses the term namespace, but the terms are essentially synonymous.
----

## Adding a project to the mesh using label selectors with the web console

You can use labels selectors to add a project to the Service Mesh with the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

* You have installed the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator.
* The deployment has an existing ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource.
* You are logged in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console as cluster-admin.

1. Navigate to Operators -> Installed Operators.
2. Click the Project menu, and from the drop-down list, select the project where your ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource is deployed. For example, istio-system.
3. Click the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator.
4. Click the Istio Service Mesh Member Roll tab.
5. Click Create ServiceMeshMember Roll.
6. Accept the default name for the ServiceMeshMemberRoll.
7. In the Labels field, enter key-value pairs to define the labels that identify which namespaces to include in the service mesh. If a project namespace has either label specified by the selectors, then the project namespace is included in the service mesh. You do not need to include both labels.

For example, entering mykey=myvalue includes all namespaces with this label as part of the mesh. When the selector identifies a match, the project namespace is added to the service mesh.

Entering myotherkey=myothervalue includes all namespaces with this label as part of the mesh. When the selector identifies a match, the project namespace is added to the service mesh.
8. Click Create.

## Adding a project to the mesh using label selectors with the CLI

You can use label selectors to add a project to the Service Mesh with the CLI.

* You have installed the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator.
* The deployment has an existing ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource.
* You are logged in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform as`cluster-admin`.

1. Log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI.
2. Edit the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource.

```terminal
$ oc edit smmr default -n istio-system
```


You can deploy the Service Mesh control plane to any project provided that it is separate from the project that contains your services.
3. Modify the YAML file to include namespace label selectors in the spec.memberSelectors field of the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource.

[NOTE]
----
Instead of using the matchLabels field, you can also use the matchExpressions field in the selector.
----

```yaml
apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
kind: ServiceMeshMemberRoll
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  memberSelectors: 1
  - matchLabels: 2
      mykey: myvalue 2
  - matchLabels: 3
      myotherkey: myothervalue 3
```

Contains the label selectors used to identify which project namespaces are included in the service mesh. If a project namespace has either label specified by the selectors, then the project namespace is included in the service mesh. The project namespace does not need both labels to be included.
Specifies all namespaces with the mykey=myvalue label. When the selector identifies a match, the project namespace is added to the service mesh.
Specifies all namespaces with the myotherkey=myothervalue label. When the selector identifies a match, the project namespace is added to the service mesh.

# Bookinfo example application

The Bookinfo example application allows you to test your Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh 2.6.5 installation on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

The Bookinfo application displays information about a book, similar to a single catalog entry of an online book store. The application displays a page that describes the book, book details (ISBN, number of pages, and other information), and book reviews.

The Bookinfo application consists of these microservices:

* The productpage microservice calls the details and reviews microservices to populate the page.
* The details microservice contains book information.
* The reviews microservice contains book reviews. It also calls the ratings microservice.
* The ratings microservice contains book ranking information that accompanies a book review.

There are three versions of the reviews microservice:

* Version v1 does not call the ratings Service.
* Version v2 calls the ratings Service and displays each rating as one to five black stars.
* Version v3 calls the ratings Service and displays each rating as one to five red stars.

## Installing the Bookinfo application

This tutorial walks you through how to create a sample application by creating a project, deploying the Bookinfo application to that project, and viewing the running application in Service Mesh.

* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.1 or higher installed.
* Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh 2.6.5 installed.
* Access to the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You are logged in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform as`cluster-admin`.


[NOTE]
----
The Bookinfo sample application cannot be installed on IBM Z(R) and IBM Power(R).

The commands in this section assume the Service Mesh control plane project is istio-system.  If you installed the control plane in another namespace, edit each command before you run it.
----

1. Click Home -> Projects.
2. Click Create Project.
3. Enter bookinfo as the Project Name, enter a Display Name, and enter a Description, then click Create.
* Alternatively, you can run this command from the CLI to create the bookinfo project.

```terminal
$ oc new-project bookinfo
```

4. Click Operators -> Installed Operators.
5. Click the Project menu and use the Service Mesh control plane namespace. In this example, use istio-system.
6. Click the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator.
7. Click the Istio Service Mesh Member Roll tab.
1. If you have already created a Istio Service Mesh Member Roll, click the name, then click the YAML tab to open the YAML editor.
2. If you have not created a ServiceMeshMemberRoll, click Create ServiceMeshMemberRoll.
8. Click Members, then enter the name of your project in the Value field.
9. Click Create to save the updated Service Mesh Member Roll.
1. Or, save the following example to a YAML file.
Bookinfo ServiceMeshMemberRoll example servicemeshmemberroll-default.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
kind: ServiceMeshMemberRoll
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  members:
  - bookinfo
```

2. Run the following command to upload that file and create the ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource in the istio-system namespace.   In this example, istio-system is the name of the Service Mesh control plane project.

```terminal
$ oc create -n istio-system -f servicemeshmemberroll-default.yaml
```

10. Run the following command to verify the ServiceMeshMemberRoll was created successfully.

```terminal
$ oc get smmr -n istio-system -o wide
```


The installation has finished successfully when the STATUS column is Configured.

```terminal
NAME      READY   STATUS       AGE   MEMBERS
default   1/1     Configured   70s   ["bookinfo"]
```

11. From the CLI, deploy the Bookinfo application in the `bookinfo` project by applying the bookinfo.yaml file:

```bash
$ oc apply -n bookinfo -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio/maistra-2.6/samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml
```


You should see output similar to the following:

```terminal
service/details created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-details created
deployment.apps/details-v1 created
service/ratings created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-ratings created
deployment.apps/ratings-v1 created
service/reviews created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-reviews created
deployment.apps/reviews-v1 created
deployment.apps/reviews-v2 created
deployment.apps/reviews-v3 created

deployment.apps/productpage-v1 created
```

12. Create the ingress gateway by applying the bookinfo-gateway.yaml file:

```bash
$ oc apply -n bookinfo -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio/maistra-2.6/samples/bookinfo/networking/bookinfo-gateway.yaml
```


You should see output similar to the following:

```terminal
gateway.networking.istio.io/bookinfo-gateway created
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/bookinfo created
```

13. Set the value for the GATEWAY_URL parameter:

```terminal
$ export GATEWAY_URL=$(oc -n istio-system get route istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
```


## Adding default destination rules

Before you can use the Bookinfo application, you must first add default destination rules. There are two preconfigured YAML files, depending on whether or not you enabled mutual transport layer security (TLS) authentication.

1. To add destination rules, run one of the following commands:
* If you did not enable mutual TLS:

```bash
$ oc apply -n bookinfo -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio/maistra-2.6/samples/bookinfo/networking/destination-rule-all.yaml
```

* If you enabled mutual TLS:

```bash
$ oc apply -n bookinfo -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/istio/maistra-2.6/samples/bookinfo/networking/destination-rule-all-mtls.yaml
```


You should see output similar to the following:

```terminal
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/productpage created
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/reviews created
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/ratings created
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/details created
```


## Verifying the Bookinfo installation

To confirm that the sample Bookinfo application was successfully deployed, perform the following steps.

* Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh installed.
* Complete the steps for installing the Bookinfo sample app.
* You are logged in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform as`cluster-admin`.

1. Verify that all pods are ready with this command:

```terminal
$ oc get pods -n bookinfo
```


All pods should have a status of Running. You should see output similar to the following:

```terminal
