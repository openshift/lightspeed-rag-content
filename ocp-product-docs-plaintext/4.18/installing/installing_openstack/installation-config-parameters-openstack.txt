# Installation configuration parameters for OpenStack


Before you deploy an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP), you provide parameters to customize your cluster and the platform that hosts it. When you create the install-config.yaml file, you provide values for the required parameters through the command line. You can then modify the install-config.yaml file to customize your cluster further.

# Available installation configuration parameters for OpenStack

The following tables specify the required, optional, and OpenStack-specific installation configuration parameters that you can set as part of the installation process.


[NOTE]
----
After installation, you cannot modify these parameters in the install-config.yaml file.

## Required configuration parameters

Required installation configuration parameters are described in the following table:



## Network configuration parameters

You can customize your installation configuration based on the requirements of your existing network infrastructure. For example, you can expand the IP address block for the cluster network or provide different IP address blocks than the defaults.

Consider the following information before you configure network parameters for your cluster:

* If you use the Red Hat OpenShift Networking OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, both IPv4 and IPv6 address families are supported.
* If you deployed nodes in an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster with a network that supports both IPv4 and non-link-local IPv6 addresses, configure your cluster to use a dual-stack network.
* For clusters configured for dual-stack networking, both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic must use the same network interface as the default gateway. This ensures that in a multiple network interface controller (NIC) environment, a cluster can detect what NIC to use based on the available network interface. For more information, see "OVN-Kubernetes IPv6 and dual-stack limitations" in About the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin.
* To prevent network connectivity issues, do not install a single-stack IPv4 cluster on a host that supports dual-stack networking.

If you configure your cluster to use both IP address families, review the following requirements:

* Both IP families must use the same network interface for the default gateway.
* Both IP families must have the default gateway.
* You must specify IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in the same order for all network configuration parameters. For example, in the following configuration IPv4 addresses are listed before IPv6 addresses.

```yaml
networking:
  clusterNetwork:
  - cidr: 10.128.0.0/14
    hostPrefix: 23
  - cidr: fd00:10:128::/56
    hostPrefix: 64
  serviceNetwork:
  - 172.30.0.0/16
  - fd00:172:16::/112
```



[NOTE]
----
Globalnet is not supported with Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation disaster recovery solutions. For regional disaster recovery scenarios, ensure that you use a non-overlapping range of private IP addresses for the cluster and service networks in each cluster.

## Optional configuration parameters

Optional installation configuration parameters are described in the following table:



## Additional Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) configuration parameters

Additional RHOSP configuration parameters are described in the following table:



1. If the machine pool defines zones, the count of types can either be a single item or match the number of items in zones. For example, the count of types cannot be 2 if there are 3 items in zones.
2. If you have any existing reference to this property, the installer populates the corresponding value in the controlPlane.platform.openstack.rootVolume.types field.

## Optional RHOSP configuration parameters

Optional RHOSP configuration parameters are described in the following table:
