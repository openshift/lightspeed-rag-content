# Using the vSphere Problem Detector Operator



# About the vSphere Problem Detector Operator

The {operator-name} checks clusters that are deployed on vSphere for common installation and misconfiguration issues that are related to storage.

The Operator runs in the openshift-cluster-storage-operator namespace and is started by the Cluster Storage Operator when the Cluster Storage Operator detects that the cluster is deployed on vSphere. The {operator-name} communicates with the vSphere vCenter Server to determine the virtual machines in the cluster, the default datastore, and other information about the vSphere vCenter Server configuration. The Operator uses the credentials from the Cloud Credential Operator to connect to vSphere.

The Operator runs the checks according to the following schedule:

* The checks run every hour.
* If any check fails, the Operator runs the checks again in intervals of 1 minute, 2 minutes, 4, 8, and so on. The Operator doubles the interval up to a maximum interval of 8 hours.
* When all checks pass, the schedule returns to an hour interval.

The Operator increases the frequency of the checks after a failure so that the Operator can report success quickly after the failure condition is remedied. You can run the Operator manually for immediate troubleshooting information.

# Running the vSphere Problem Detector Operator checks

You can override the schedule for running the {operator-name} checks and run the checks immediately.

The {operator-name} automatically runs the checks every hour. However, when the Operator starts, it runs the checks immediately. The Operator is started by the Cluster Storage Operator when the Cluster Storage Operator starts and determines that the cluster is running on vSphere. To run the checks immediately, you can scale the {operator-name} to 0 and back to 1 so that it restarts the {operator-name}.

* Access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.

* Scale the Operator to 0:

```terminal
$ oc scale deployment/vsphere-problem-detector-operator --replicas=0 \
    -n openshift-cluster-storage-operator
```


* Verify that the pods have restarted by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-cluster-storage-operator get pod -l name=vsphere-problem-detector-operator -w
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
vsphere-problem-detector-operator-77486bd645-9ntpb   1/1     Running   0          11s
```


The AGE field must indicate that the pod is restarted.

# Viewing the events from the vSphere Problem Detector Operator

After the {operator-name} runs and performs the configuration checks, it creates events that can be viewed from the command line or from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

* To view the events by using the command line, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get event -n openshift-cluster-storage-operator \
    --sort-by={.metadata.creationTimestamp}
```

Example output

```terminal
16m     Normal    Started             pod/vsphere-problem-detector-operator-xxxxx         Started container vsphere-problem-detector
16m     Normal    Created             pod/vsphere-problem-detector-operator-xxxxx         Created container vsphere-problem-detector
16m     Normal    LeaderElection      configmap/vsphere-problem-detector-lock    vsphere-problem-detector-operator-xxxxx became leader
```

* To view the events by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, navigate to Home -> Events and select openshift-cluster-storage-operator from the Project menu.

# Viewing the logs from the vSphere Problem Detector Operator

After the {operator-name} runs and performs the configuration checks, it creates log records that can be viewed from the command line or from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

* To view the logs by using the command line, run the following command:

```terminal
$ oc logs deployment/vsphere-problem-detector-operator \
    -n openshift-cluster-storage-operator
```

Example output

```terminal
I0108 08:32:28.445696       1 operator.go:209] ClusterInfo passed
I0108 08:32:28.451029       1 datastore.go:57] CheckStorageClasses checked 1 storage classes, 0 problems found
I0108 08:32:28.451047       1 operator.go:209] CheckStorageClasses passed
I0108 08:32:28.452160       1 operator.go:209] CheckDefaultDatastore passed
I0108 08:32:28.480648       1 operator.go:271] CheckNodeDiskUUID:<host_name> passed
I0108 08:32:28.480685       1 operator.go:271] CheckNodeProviderID:<host_name> passed
```

* To view the Operator logs with the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console, perform the following steps:
1. Navigate to Workloads -> Pods.
2. Select openshift-cluster-storage-operator from the Projects menu.
3. Click the link for the vsphere-problem-detector-operator pod.
4. Click the Logs tab on the Pod details page to view the logs.

# Configuration checks run by the vSphere Problem Detector Operator

The following tables identify the configuration checks that the {operator-name} runs. Some checks verify the configuration of the cluster. Other checks verify the configuration of each node in the cluster.





# About the storage class configuration check

The names for persistent volumes that use vSphere storage are related to the datastore name and cluster ID.

When a persistent volume is created, systemd creates a mount unit for the persistent volume. The systemd process has a 255 character limit for the length of the fully qualified path to the VDMK file that is used for the persistent volume.

The fully qualified path is based on the naming conventions for systemd and vSphere. The naming conventions use the following pattern:


```text
/var/lib/kubelet/plugins/kubernetes.io/vsphere-volume/mounts/[<datastore>] 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/<cluster_id>-dynamic-pvc-00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000.vmdk
```


* The naming conventions require 205 characters of the 255 character limit.
* The datastore name and the cluster ID are determined from the deployment.
* The datastore name and cluster ID are substituted into the preceding pattern. Then the path is processed with the systemd-escape command to escape special characters. For example, a hyphen character uses four characters after it is escaped. The escaped value is \x2d.
* After processing with systemd-escape to ensure that systemd can access the fully qualified path to the VDMK file, the length of the path must be less than 255 characters.
