# Installing a cluster on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) by using the Agent-based Installer


In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18, you can use the Agent-based Installer to install a cluster on Oracle(R) Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), so that you can run cluster workloads on infrastructure that supports dedicated, hybrid, public, and multiple cloud environments.
Installing a cluster on OCI is supported for virtual machines (VMs) and bare-metal machines.

[NOTE]
----
You can deploy Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on a Dedicated Region (Oracle documentation) the same as any region from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).
----

# The Agent-based Installer and OCI overview

You can install an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on Oracle&#174; Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) by using the Agent-based Installer. Red&#160;Hat and Oracle test, validate, and support running OCI workloads in an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

The Agent-based Installer provides the ease of use of the Assisted Installation service, but with the capability to install a cluster in either a connected or disconnected environment.

The following diagrams show workflows for connected and disconnected environments:

OCI provides services that can meet your regulatory compliance, performance, and cost-effectiveness needs. OCI supports 64-bit x86 instances and 64-bit ARM instances.


[NOTE]
----
Consider selecting a nonvolatile memory express (NVMe) drive or a solid-state drive (SSD) for your boot disk, because these drives offer low latency and high throughput capabilities for your boot disk.
----

By running your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on OCI, you can access the following capabilities:

* Compute flexible shapes, where you can customize the number of Oracle(R) CPUs (OCPUs) and memory resources for your VM. With access to this capability, a cluster’s workload can perform operations in a resource-balanced environment. You can find all RHEL-certified OCI shapes by going to the Oracle page on the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog portal.
* Block Volume storage, where you can configure scaling and auto-tuning settings for your storage volume, so that the Block Volume service automatically adjusts the performance level to optimize performance.


[IMPORTANT]
----
To ensure the best performance conditions for your cluster workloads that operate on OCI and on the OCVS service, ensure volume performance units (VPUs) for your block volume is sized for your workloads. The following list provides some guidance in selecting the VPUs needed for specific performance needs:
* Test or proof of concept environment: 100 GB, and 20 to 30 VPUs.
* Basic environment: 500 GB, and 60 VPUs.
* Heavy production environment: More than 500 GB, and 100 or more VPUs.
Consider reserving additional VPUs to provide sufficient capacity for updates and scaling activities. For more information about VPUs, see Volume Performance Units (Oracle documentation).

# Installation process workflow

The following workflow describes a high-level outline for the process of installing an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on OCI using the Agent-based Installer:

1. Create OCI resources and services (Oracle).
2. Disconnected environments: Prepare a web server that is accessible by OCI instances (Red Hat).
3. Prepare configuration files for the Agent-based Installer (Red Hat).
4. Generate the agent ISO image (Red Hat).
5. Disconnected environments: Upload the rootfs image to the web server (Red Hat).
6. Configure your firewall for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (Red Hat).
7. Upload the agent ISO image to a storage bucket (Oracle).
8. Create a custom image from the uploaded agent ISO image (Oracle).
9. Create compute instances on OCI (Oracle).
10. Verify that your cluster runs on OCI (Oracle).

# Creating OCI infrastructure resources and services

You must create an OCI environment on your virtual machine (VM) or bare-metal shape. By creating this environment, you can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and deploy a cluster on an infrastructure that supports a wide range of cloud options and strong security policies. Having prior knowledge of OCI components can help you with understanding the concept of OCI resources and how you can configure them to meet your organizational needs.

The Agent-based Installer method for installing an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on OCI requires that you manually create OCI resources and services.


[IMPORTANT]
----
To ensure compatibility with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, you must set A as the record type for each DNS record and name records as follows:
* api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>, which targets the apiVIP parameter of the API load balancer
* api-int.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>, which targets the apiVIP parameter of the API load balancer
* *.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>, which targets the ingressVIP parameter of the Ingress load balancer
The api.* and api-int.* DNS records relate to control plane machines, so you must ensure that all nodes in your installed Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster can access these DNS records.
----

* You configured an OCI account to host the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. See Prerequisites (Oracle documentation).

* Create the required OCI resources and services.

For installations in a connected environment, see Provisioning Cluster Infrastructure Using Terraform (Oracle documentation).

For installations in a disconnected environment, see Provisioning OCI Resources for the Agent-based Installer in Disconnected Environments (Oracle documentation).

* Learn About Oracle Cloud Basics (Oracle documentation)

# Creating configuration files for installing a cluster on OCI

You must create the install-config.yaml and the agent-config.yaml configuration files so that you can use the Agent-based Installer to generate a bootable ISO image. The Agent-based installation comprises a bootable ISO that has the Assisted discovery agent and the Assisted Service. Both of these components are required to perform the cluster installation, but the latter component runs on only one of the hosts.


[NOTE]
----
You can also use the Agent-based Installer to generate or accept Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) custom resources.
----

* You reviewed details about the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation and update processes.
* You read the documentation on selecting a cluster installation method and preparing the method for users.
* You have read the "Preparing to install with the Agent-based Installer" documentation.
* You downloaded the Agent-Based Installer and the command-line interface (CLI) from the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console.
* If you are installing in a disconnected environment, you have prepared a mirror registry in your environment and mirrored release images to the registry.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Check that your openshift-install binary version relates to your local image container registry and not a shared registry, such as Red Hat Quay, by running the following command:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install version
```


```terminal
./openshift-install 4.18.0
built from commit ae7977b7d1ca908674a0d45c5c243c766fa4b2ca
release image registry.ci.openshift.org/origin/release:4.18ocp-release@sha256:0da6316466d60a3a4535d5fed3589feb0391989982fba59d47d4c729912d6363
release architecture amd64
```

----
* You have logged in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform with administrator privileges.

1. Create an installation directory to store configuration files in by running the following command:

```terminal
$ mkdir ~/<directory_name>
```

2. Configure the install-config.yaml configuration file to meet the needs of your organization and save the file in the directory you created.
install-config.yaml file that sets an external platform

```yaml
# install-config.yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: <base_domain> 1
networking:
  clusterNetwork:
  - cidr: 10.128.0.0/14
    hostPrefix: 23
  network type: OVNKubernetes
  machineNetwork:
  - cidr: <ip_address_from_cidr> 2
  serviceNetwork:
  - 172.30.0.0/16
compute:
  - architecture: amd64 3
  hyperthreading: Enabled
  name: worker
  replicas: 0
controlPlane:
  architecture: amd64 3
  hyperthreading: Enabled
  name: master
  replicas: 3
platform:
   external:
    platformName: oci 4
    cloudControllerManager: External
sshKey: <public_ssh_key> 5
pullSecret: '<pull_secret>' 6
# ...
```

The base domain of your cloud provider.
The IP address from the virtual cloud network (VCN) that the CIDR allocates to resources and components that operate on your network.
Depending on your infrastructure, you can select either arm64 or amd64.
Set OCI as the external platform, so that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform can integrate with OCI.
Specify your SSH public key.
The pull secret that you need for authenticate purposes when downloading container images for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform components and services, such as Quay.io. See Install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 from the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console.
3. Create a directory on your local system named openshift. This must be a subdirectory of the installation directory.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not move the install-config.yaml or agent-config.yaml configuration files to the openshift directory.
----
4. If you used a stack to provision OCI infrastructure resources: Copy and paste the dynamic_custom_manifest output of the OCI stack into a file titled manifest.yaml and save the file in the openshift directory.
5. If you did not use a stack to provision OCI infrastructure resources: Download and prepare custom manifests to create an Agent ISO image:
1. Go to Configuration Files (Oracle documentation) and follow the link to the custom manifests directory on GitHub.
2. Copy the contents of the condensed-manifest.yml file and save it locally to a file in the openshift directory.
3. In the condensed-manifest.yml file, update the sections marked with TODO to specify the compartment Oracle(R) Cloud Identifier (OCID), VCN OCID, subnet OCID from the load balancer, and the security lists OCID.
6. Configure the agent-config.yaml configuration file to meet your organization's requirements.
Sample agent-config.yaml file for an IPv4 network.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1beta1
metadata:
  name: <cluster_name> 1
  namespace: <cluster_namespace> 2
rendezvousIP: <ip_address_from_CIDR> 3
bootArtifactsBaseURL: <server_URL> 4
# ...
```

The cluster name that you specified in your DNS record.
The namespace of your cluster on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
If you use IPv4 as the network IP address format, ensure that you set the rendezvousIP parameter to an IPv4 address that the VCN's Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) method allocates on your network. Also ensure that at least one instance from the pool of instances that you booted with the ISO matches the IP address value you set for the rendezvousIP parameter.
The URL of the server where you want to upload the rootfs image. This parameter is required only for disconnected environments.
7. Generate a minimal ISO image, which excludes the rootfs image, by entering the following command in your installation directory:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install agent create image --log-level debug
```


The command also completes the following actions:
* Creates a subdirectory, ./<installation_directory>/auth directory:, and places kubeadmin-password and kubeconfig files in the subdirectory.
* Creates a rendezvousIP file based on the IP address that you specified in the agent-config.yaml configuration file.
* Optional: Any modifications you made to agent-config.yaml and install-config.yaml configuration files get imported to the Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) custom resources.

[IMPORTANT]
----
The Agent-based Installer uses Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS). The rootfs image, which is mentioned in a later step, is required for booting, recovering, and repairing your operating system.
----
8. Disconnected environments only: Upload the rootfs image to a web server.
1. Go to the ./<installation_directory>/boot-artifacts directory that was generated when you created the minimal ISO image.
2. Use your preferred web server, such as any Hypertext Transfer Protocol daemon (httpd), to upload the rootfs image to the location specified in the bootArtifactsBaseURL parameter of the agent-config.yaml file.

For example, if the bootArtifactsBaseURL parameter states http://192.168.122.20, you would upload the generated rootfs image to this location so that the Agent-based installer can access the image from http://192.168.122.20/agent.x86_64-rootfs.img. After the Agent-based installer boots the minimal ISO for the external platform, the Agent-based Installer downloads the rootfs image from the http://192.168.122.20/agent.x86_64-rootfs.img location into the system memory.

[NOTE]
----
The Agent-based Installer also adds the value of the bootArtifactsBaseURL to the minimal ISO Image's configuration, so that when the Operator boots a cluster's node, the Agent-based Installer downloads the rootfs image into system memory.
----

[IMPORTANT]
----
Consider that the full ISO image, which is in excess of 1 GB, includes the rootfs image. The image is larger than the minimal ISO Image, which is typically less than 150 MB.

# Configuring your firewall for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

Before you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, you must configure your firewall to grant access to the sites that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform requires. When using a firewall, make additional configurations to the firewall so that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform can access the sites that it requires to function.

For a disconnected environment, you must mirror content from both Red&#160;Hat and Oracle. This environment requires that you create firewall rules to expose your firewall to specific ports and registries.


[NOTE]
----
If your environment has a dedicated load balancer in front of your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, review the allowlists between your firewall and load balancer to prevent unwanted network restrictions to your cluster.
----

1. Set the following registry URLs for your firewall's allowlist:

* You can use the wildcard *.quay.io instead of cdn.quay.io and cdn0[1-6].quay.io in your allowlist.
* You can use the wildcard *.access.redhat.com to simplify the configuration and ensure that all subdomains, including registry.access.redhat.com, are allowed.
* When you add a site, such as quay.io, to your allowlist, do not add a wildcard entry, such as *.quay.io, to your denylist. In most cases, image registries use a content delivery network (CDN) to serve images. If a firewall blocks access, image downloads are denied when the initial download request redirects to a hostname such as cdn01.quay.io.
2. Set your firewall's allowlist to include any site that provides resources for a language or framework that your builds require.
3. If you do not disable Telemetry, you must grant access to the following URLs to access Red Hat Insights:

4. Set your firewall's allowlist to include the following registry URLs:

5. Set your firewall's allowlist to include the following external URLs. Each repository URL hosts OCI containers. Consider mirroring images to as few repositories as possible to reduce any performance issues.


# Running a cluster on OCI

To run a cluster on Oracle&#174; Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), you must upload the generated agent ISO image to the default Object Storage bucket on OCI. Additionally, you must create a compute instance from the supplied base image, so that your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and OCI can communicate with each other for the purposes of running the cluster on OCI.


[NOTE]
----
OCI supports the following Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster topologies:
* Installing an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on a single node.
* A highly available cluster that has a minimum of three control plane instances and two compute instances.
* A compact three-node cluster that has a minimum of three control plane instances.
----

* You generated an agent ISO image. See the "Creating configuration files for installing a cluster on OCI" section.

1. Upload the agent ISO image to Oracle’s default Object Storage bucket and import the agent ISO image as a custom image to this bucket. Ensure you that you configure the custom image to boot in Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) mode. For more information, see Creating the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform ISO Image (Oracle documentation).
2. Create a compute instance from the supplied base image for your cluster topology. See Creating the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on OCI (Oracle documentation).

[IMPORTANT]
----
Before you create the compute instance, check that you have enough memory and disk resources for your cluster. Additionally, ensure that at least one compute instance has the same IP address as the address stated under rendezvousIP in the agent-config.yaml file.

# Verifying that your Agent-based cluster installation runs on OCI

Verify that your cluster was installed and is running effectively on Oracle&#174; Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).

* You created all the required OCI resources and services. See the "Creating OCI infrastructure resources and services" section.
* You created install-config.yaml and agent-config.yaml configuration files. See the "Creating configuration files for installing a cluster on OCI" section.
* You uploaded the agent ISO image to a default Oracle Object Storage bucket, and you created a compute instance on OCI. For more information, see "Running a cluster on OCI".

After you deploy the compute instance on a self-managed node in your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, you can monitor the cluster’s status by choosing one of the following options:

* From the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install agent wait-for install-complete --log-level debug
```


Check the status of the rendezvous host node that runs the bootstrap node.  After the host reboots, the host forms part of the cluster.
* Use the kubeconfig API to check the status of various Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform components. For the  KUBECONFIG environment variable, set the relative path of the cluster’s kubeconfig configuration file:

```terminal
$  export KUBECONFIG=~/auth/kubeconfig
```


Check the status of each of the cluster’s self-managed nodes. CCM applies a label to each node to designate the node as running in a cluster on OCI.

```terminal
$ oc get nodes -A
```

Output example

```terminal
NAME                                   STATUS ROLES                 AGE VERSION
main-0.private.agenttest.oraclevcn.com Ready  control-plane, master 7m  v1.27.4+6eeca63
main-1.private.agenttest.oraclevcn.com Ready  control-plane, master 15m v1.27.4+d7fa83f
main-2.private.agenttest.oraclevcn.com Ready  control-plane, master 15m v1.27.4+d7fa83f
```


Check the status of each of the cluster’s Operators, with the CCM Operator status being a good indicator that your cluster is running.

```terminal
$ oc get co
```

Truncated output example

```terminal
NAME           VERSION     AVAILABLE  PROGRESSING    DEGRADED   SINCE   MESSAGE
authentication 4.18.0-0    True       False          False      6m18s
