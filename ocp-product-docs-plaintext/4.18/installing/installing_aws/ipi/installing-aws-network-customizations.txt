# Installing a cluster on AWS with network customizations


In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.18, you can install a cluster on
Amazon Web Services (AWS) with customized network configuration options. By
customizing your network configuration, your cluster can coexist with existing
IP address allocations in your environment and integrate with existing MTU and
VXLAN configurations.
You must set most of the network configuration parameters during installation,
and you can modify only kubeProxy configuration parameters in a running
cluster.

# Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation and update processes.
* You read the documentation on selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users.
* You configured an AWS account to host the cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
----
If you have an AWS profile stored on your computer, it must not use a temporary session token that you generated while using a multi-factor authentication device. The cluster continues to use your current AWS credentials to create AWS resources for the entire life of the cluster, so you must use key-based, long-term credentials. To generate appropriate keys, see Managing Access Keys for IAM Users in the AWS documentation. You can supply the keys when you run the installation program.
----
* If you use a firewall, you configured it to allow the sites that your cluster requires access to.

# Network configuration phases

There are two phases prior to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation where you can customize the network configuration.

Phase 1:: You can customize the following network-related fields in the install-config.yaml file before you create the manifest files:
* networking.networkType
* networking.clusterNetwork
* networking.serviceNetwork
* networking.machineNetwork
* nodeNetworking

For more information, see "Installation configuration parameters".

[NOTE]
----
Set the networking.machineNetwork to match the Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) where the preferred subnet is located.
----

[IMPORTANT]
----
The CIDR range 172.17.0.0/16 is reserved by libVirt. You cannot use any other CIDR range that overlaps with the 172.17.0.0/16 CIDR range for networks in your cluster.
----
Phase 2:: After creating the manifest files by running openshift-install create manifests, you can define a customized Cluster Network Operator manifest with only the fields you want to modify. You can use the manifest to specify an advanced network configuration.

During phase 2, you cannot override the values that you specified in phase 1 in the install-config.yaml file. However, you can customize the network plugin during phase 2.

# Creating the installation configuration file

You can customize the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster you install on
Amazon Web Services (AWS).

* You have the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.

1. Create the install-config.yaml file.
1. Change to the directory that contains the installation program and run the following command:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install create install-config --dir <installation_directory> 1
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the directory name to store the
files that the installation program creates.

When specifying the directory:
* Verify that the directory has the execute permission. This permission is required to run Terraform binaries under the installation directory.
* Use an empty directory. Some installation assets, such as bootstrap X.509 certificates, have short expiration intervals, therefore you must not reuse an installation directory. If you want to reuse individual files from another cluster installation, you can copy them into your directory. However, the file names for the installation assets might change between releases. Use caution when copying installation files from an earlier Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version.
2. At the prompts, provide the configuration details for your cloud:
1. Optional: Select an SSH key to use to access your cluster machines.

[NOTE]
----
For production Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your ssh-agent process uses.
----
2. Select AWS as the platform to target.
3. If you do not have an Amazon Web Services (AWS) profile stored on your computer, enter the AWS
access key ID and secret access key for the user that you configured to run the
installation program.
4. Select the AWS region to deploy the cluster to.
5. Select the base domain for the Route 53 service that you configured for your cluster.
6. Enter a descriptive name for your cluster.
2. Modify the install-config.yaml file. You can find more information about the available parameters in the "Installation configuration parameters" section.
3. Back up the install-config.yaml file so that you can use
it to install multiple clusters.

[IMPORTANT]
----
The install-config.yaml file is consumed during the installation process. If
you want to reuse the file, you must back it up now.
----

## Minimum resource requirements for cluster installation

Each cluster machine must meet the following minimum requirements:



1. One vCPU is equivalent to one physical core when simultaneous multithreading (SMT), or Hyper-Threading, is not enabled. When enabled, use the following formula to calculate the corresponding ratio: (threads per core × cores) × sockets = vCPUs.
2. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and Kubernetes are sensitive to disk performance, and faster storage is recommended, particularly for etcd on the control plane nodes which require a 10 ms p99 fsync duration. Note that on many cloud platforms, storage size and IOPS scale together, so you might need to over-allocate storage volume to obtain sufficient performance.
3. As with all user-provisioned installations, if you choose to use RHEL compute machines in your cluster, you take responsibility for all operating system life cycle management and maintenance, including performing system updates, applying patches, and completing all other required tasks. Use of RHEL 7 compute machines is deprecated and has been removed in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.10 and later.


[NOTE]
----
For Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.18, RHCOS is based on RHEL version 9.4, which updates the micro-architecture requirements. The following list contains the minimum instruction set architectures (ISA) that each architecture requires:
* x86-64 architecture requires x86-64-v2 ISA
* ARM64 architecture requires ARMv8.0-A ISA
* IBM Power architecture requires Power 9 ISA
* s390x architecture requires z14 ISA
For more information, see Architectures (RHEL documentation).
----

If an instance type for your platform meets the minimum requirements for cluster machines, it is supported to use in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

* Optimizing storage

## Tested instance types for AWS

The following Amazon Web Services (AWS) instance types have been tested with
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.


[NOTE]
----
Use the machine types included in the following charts for your AWS instances. If you use an instance type that is not listed in the chart, ensure that the instance size you use matches the minimum resource requirements that are listed in the section named "Minimum resource requirements for cluster installation".

## Tested instance types for AWS on 64-bit ARM infrastructures

The following Amazon Web Services (AWS) 64-bit ARM instance types have been tested with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.


[NOTE]
----
Use the machine types included in the following charts for your AWS ARM instances. If you use an instance type that is not listed in the chart, ensure that the instance size you use matches the minimum resource requirements that are listed in "Minimum resource requirements for cluster installation".
----

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/installer/release-4.18/docs/user/aws/tested_instance_types_aarch64.md

## Sample customized install-config.yaml file for AWS

You can customize the installation configuration file (install-config.yaml) to specify more details about your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster&#8217;s platform or modify the values of the required parameters.


[IMPORTANT]
----
This sample YAML file is provided for reference only. You must obtain your install-config.yaml file by using the installation program and modify it.
For a full list and description of all installation configuration parameters, see Installation configuration parameters for AWS.
----


```yaml
apiVersion: v1 1
baseDomain: example.com
sshKey: ssh-ed25519 AAAA...
pullSecret: '{"auths": ...}'
metadata:
  name: example-cluster
controlPlane: 2
  name: master
  platform:
    aws:
      type: m6i.xlarge
  replicas: 3
compute: 3
-  name: worker
  platform:
    aws:
      type: c5.4xlarge
  replicas: 3
networking: 4
  clusterNetwork:
  - cidr: 10.128.0.0/14
    hostPrefix: 23
platform: 5
  aws:
    region: us-west-2
```


Parameters at the first level of indentation apply to the cluster globally.
The controlPlane stanza applies to control plane machines.
The compute stanza applies to compute machines.
The networking stanza applies to the cluster networking configuration. If you do not provide networking values, the installation program provides default values.
The platform stanza applies to the infrastructure platform that hosts the cluster.

* Installation configuration parameters for AWS

## Configuring the cluster-wide proxy during installation

Production environments can deny direct access to the internet and instead have
an HTTP or HTTPS proxy available. You can configure a new Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
cluster to use a proxy by configuring the proxy settings in the
install-config.yaml file.

* You have an existing install-config.yaml file.
* You reviewed the sites that your cluster requires access to and determined whether any of them need to bypass the proxy. By default, all cluster egress traffic is proxied, including calls to hosting cloud provider APIs. You added sites to the Proxy object's spec.noProxy field to bypass the proxy if necessary.

[NOTE]
----
The Proxy object status.noProxy field is populated with the values of the networking.machineNetwork[].cidr, networking.clusterNetwork[].cidr, and networking.serviceNetwork[] fields from your installation configuration.
For installations on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, and Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP), the Proxy object status.noProxy field is also populated with the instance metadata endpoint (169.254.169.254).
----

1. Edit your install-config.yaml file and add the proxy settings. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: my.domain.com
proxy:
  httpProxy: http://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port> 1
  httpsProxy: https://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port> 2
  noProxy: ec2.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com,elasticloadbalancing.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com,s3.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com 3
additionalTrustBundle: | 4
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    <MY_TRUSTED_CA_CERT>
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
additionalTrustBundlePolicy: <policy_to_add_additionalTrustBundle> 5
```

A proxy URL to use for creating HTTP connections outside the cluster. The
URL scheme must be http.
A proxy URL to use for creating HTTPS connections outside the cluster.
A comma-separated list of destination domain names, IP addresses, or other network CIDRs to exclude from proxying. Preface a domain with . to match subdomains only. For example, .y.com matches x.y.com, but not y.com. Use * to bypass the proxy for all destinations.
If you have added the Amazon EC2,Elastic Load Balancing, and S3 VPC endpoints to your VPC, you must add these endpoints to the noProxy field.
If provided, the installation program generates a config map that is named user-ca-bundle in
the openshift-config namespace that contains one or more additional CA
certificates that are required for proxying HTTPS connections. The Cluster Network
Operator then creates a trusted-ca-bundle config map that merges these contents
with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) trust bundle, and this config map is referenced in the trustedCA field of the Proxy object. The additionalTrustBundle field is required unless
the proxy's identity certificate is signed by an authority from the RHCOS trust
bundle.
Optional: The policy to determine the configuration of the Proxy object to reference the user-ca-bundle config map in the trustedCA field. The allowed values are Proxyonly and Always. Use Proxyonly to reference the user-ca-bundle config map only when http/https proxy is configured. Use Always to always reference the user-ca-bundle config map. The default value is Proxyonly.

[NOTE]
----
The installation program does not support the proxy readinessEndpoints field.
----

[NOTE]
----
If the installer times out, restart and then complete the deployment by using the wait-for command of the installer. For example:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install wait-for install-complete --log-level debug
```

----
2. Save the file and reference it when installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

The installation program creates a cluster-wide proxy that is named cluster that uses the proxy
settings in the provided install-config.yaml file. If no proxy settings are
provided, a cluster Proxy object is still created, but it will have a nil
spec.


[NOTE]
----
Only the Proxy object named cluster is supported, and no additional
proxies can be created.
----

# Alternatives to storing administrator-level secrets in the kube-system project

By default, administrator secrets are stored in the kube-system project. If you configured the credentialsMode parameter in the install-config.yaml file to Manual, you must use one of the following alternatives:

* To manage long-term cloud credentials manually, follow the procedure in Manually creating long-term credentials.
* To implement short-term credentials that are managed outside the cluster for individual components, follow the procedures in Configuring an AWS cluster to use short-term credentials.

## Manually creating long-term credentials

The Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) can be put into manual mode prior to installation in environments where the cloud identity and access management (IAM) APIs are not reachable, or the administrator prefers not to store an administrator-level credential secret in the cluster kube-system namespace.

1. If you did not set the credentialsMode parameter in the install-config.yaml configuration file to Manual, modify the value as shown:
Sample configuration file snippet

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
credentialsMode: Manual
# ...
```

2. If you have not previously created installation manifest files, do so by running the following command:

```terminal
$ openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory>
```


where <installation_directory> is the directory in which the installation program creates files.
3. Set a $RELEASE_IMAGE variable with the release image from your installation file by running the following command:

```terminal
$ RELEASE_IMAGE=$(./openshift-install version | awk '/release image/ {print $3}')
```

4. Extract the list of CredentialsRequest custom resources (CRs) from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc adm release extract \
  --from=$RELEASE_IMAGE \
  --credentials-requests \
  --included \1
  --install-config=<path_to_directory_with_installation_configuration>/install-config.yaml \2
  --to=<path_to_directory_for_credentials_requests> 3
```

The --included parameter includes only the manifests that your specific cluster configuration requires.
Specify the location of the install-config.yaml file.
Specify the path to the directory where you want to store the CredentialsRequest objects. If the specified directory does not exist, this command creates it.

This command creates a YAML file for each CredentialsRequest object.
Sample CredentialsRequest object

```yaml
apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
kind: CredentialsRequest
metadata:
  name: <component_credentials_request>
  namespace: openshift-cloud-credential-operator
  ...
spec:
  providerSpec:
    apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
    kind: AWSProviderSpec
    statementEntries:
    - effect: Allow
      action:
      - iam:GetUser
      - iam:GetUserPolicy
      - iam:ListAccessKeys
      resource: "*"
  ...
```

5. Create YAML files for secrets in the openshift-install manifests directory that you generated previously. The secrets must be stored using the namespace and secret name defined in the spec.secretRef for each CredentialsRequest object.
Sample CredentialsRequest object with secrets

```yaml
apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
kind: CredentialsRequest
metadata:
  name: <component_credentials_request>
  namespace: openshift-cloud-credential-operator
  ...
spec:
  providerSpec:
    apiVersion: cloudcredential.openshift.io/v1
    kind: AWSProviderSpec
    statementEntries:
    - effect: Allow
      action:
      - s3:CreateBucket
      - s3:DeleteBucket
      resource: "*"
      ...
  secretRef:
    name: <component_secret>
    namespace: <component_namespace>
  ...
```

Sample Secret object

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: <component_secret>
  namespace: <component_namespace>
data:
  aws_access_key_id: <base64_encoded_aws_access_key_id>
  aws_secret_access_key: <base64_encoded_aws_secret_access_key>
```



[IMPORTANT]
----
Before upgrading a cluster that uses manually maintained credentials, you must ensure that the CCO is in an upgradeable state.
----

## Configuring an AWS cluster to use short-term credentials

To install a cluster that is configured to use the AWS Security Token Service (STS), you must configure the CCO utility and create the required AWS resources for your cluster.

### Configuring the Cloud Credential Operator utility

To create and manage cloud credentials from outside of the cluster when the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) is operating in manual mode, extract and prepare the CCO utility (ccoctl) binary.


[NOTE]
----
The ccoctl utility is a Linux binary that must run in a Linux environment.
----

* You have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform account with cluster administrator access.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have created an AWS account for the ccoctl utility to use with the following permissions:
Required iam permissions
* iam:CreateOpenIDConnectProvider
* iam:CreateRole
* iam:DeleteOpenIDConnectProvider
* iam:DeleteRole
* iam:DeleteRolePolicy
* iam:GetOpenIDConnectProvider
* iam:GetRole
* iam:GetUser
* iam:ListOpenIDConnectProviders
* iam:ListRolePolicies
* iam:ListRoles
* iam:PutRolePolicy
* iam:TagOpenIDConnectProvider
* iam:TagRole
Required s3 permissions
* s3:CreateBucket
* s3:DeleteBucket
* s3:DeleteObject
* s3:GetBucketAcl
* s3:GetBucketTagging
* s3:GetObject
* s3:GetObjectAcl
* s3:GetObjectTagging
* s3:ListBucket
* s3:PutBucketAcl
* s3:PutBucketPolicy
* s3:PutBucketPublicAccessBlock
* s3:PutBucketTagging
* s3:PutObject
* s3:PutObjectAcl
* s3:PutObjectTagging
Required cloudfront permissions
* cloudfront:ListCloudFrontOriginAccessIdentities
* cloudfront:ListDistributions
* cloudfront:ListTagsForResource
* If you plan to store the OIDC configuration in a private S3 bucket that is accessed by the IAM identity provider through a public CloudFront distribution URL, the AWS account that runs the ccoctl utility requires the following additional permissions:
* cloudfront:CreateCloudFrontOriginAccessIdentity
* cloudfront:CreateDistribution
* cloudfront:DeleteCloudFrontOriginAccessIdentity
* cloudfront:DeleteDistribution
* cloudfront:GetCloudFrontOriginAccessIdentity
* cloudfront:GetCloudFrontOriginAccessIdentityConfig
* cloudfront:GetDistribution
* cloudfront:TagResource
* cloudfront:UpdateDistribution

[NOTE]
----
These additional permissions support the use of the --create-private-s3-bucket option when processing credentials requests with the ccoctl aws create-all command.
----

1. Set a variable for the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:

```terminal
$ RELEASE_IMAGE=$(./openshift-install version | awk '/release image/ {print $3}')
```

2. Obtain the CCO container image from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:

```terminal
$ CCO_IMAGE=$(oc adm release info --image-for='cloud-credential-operator' $RELEASE_IMAGE -a ~/.pull-secret)
```


[NOTE]
----
Ensure that the architecture of the $RELEASE_IMAGE matches the architecture of the environment in which you will use the ccoctl tool.
----
3. Extract the ccoctl binary from the CCO container image within the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc image extract $CCO_IMAGE \
  --file="/usr/bin/ccoctl.<rhel_version>" \1
  -a ~/.pull-secret
```

For <rhel_version>, specify the value that corresponds to the version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) that the host uses.
If no value is specified, ccoctl.rhel8 is used by default.
The following values are valid:
* rhel8: Specify this value for hosts that use RHEL 8.
* rhel9: Specify this value for hosts that use RHEL 9.
4. Change the permissions to make ccoctl executable by running the following command:

```terminal
$ chmod 775 ccoctl.<rhel_version>
```


* To verify that ccoctl is ready to use, display the help file. Use a relative file name when you run the command, for example:

```terminal
$ ./ccoctl.rhel9
```

Example output

```terminal
OpenShift credentials provisioning tool

Usage:
  ccoctl [command]

Available Commands:
  aws          Manage credentials objects for AWS cloud
  azure        Manage credentials objects for Azure
  gcp          Manage credentials objects for Google cloud
  help         Help about any command
  ibmcloud     Manage credentials objects for {ibm-cloud-title}
  nutanix      Manage credentials objects for Nutanix

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for ccoctl

Use "ccoctl [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```


### Creating AWS resources with the Cloud Credential Operator utility

You have the following options when creating AWS resources:

* You can use the ccoctl aws create-all command to create the AWS resources automatically. This is the quickest way to create the resources. See Creating AWS resources with a single command.
* If you need to review the JSON files that the ccoctl tool creates before modifying AWS resources, or if the process the ccoctl tool uses to create AWS resources automatically does not meet the requirements of your organization, you can create the AWS resources individually. See Creating AWS resources individually.

#### Creating AWS resources with a single command

If the process the ccoctl tool uses to create AWS resources automatically meets the requirements of your organization, you can use the ccoctl aws create-all command to automate the creation of AWS resources.

Otherwise, you can create the AWS resources individually. For more information, see "Creating AWS resources individually".


[NOTE]
----
By default, ccoctl creates objects in the directory in which the commands are run. To create the objects in a different directory, use the --output-dir flag. This procedure uses <path_to_ccoctl_output_dir> to refer to this directory.
----

You must have:

* Extracted and prepared the ccoctl binary.

1. Set a $RELEASE_IMAGE variable with the release image from your installation file by running the following command:

```terminal
$ RELEASE_IMAGE=$(./openshift-install version | awk '/release image/ {print $3}')
```

2. Extract the list of CredentialsRequest objects from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release image by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc adm release extract \
  --from=$RELEASE_IMAGE \
  --credentials-requests \
  --included \1
  --install-config=<path_to_directory_with_installation_configuration>/install-config.yaml \2
  --to=<path_to_directory_for_credentials_requests> 3
```

The --included parameter includes only the manifests that your specific cluster configuration requires.
Specify the location of the install-config.yaml file.
Specify the path to the directory where you want to store the CredentialsRequest objects. If the specified directory does not exist, this command creates it.

[NOTE]
----
This command might take a few moments to run.
----
3. Use the ccoctl tool to process all CredentialsRequest objects by running the following command:

```terminal
$ ccoctl aws create-all \
  --name=<name> \1
  --region=<aws_region> \2
  --credentials-requests-dir=<path_to_credentials_requests_directory> \3
  --output-dir=<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir> \4
  --create-private-s3-bucket 5
```

Specify the name used to tag any cloud resources that are created for tracking.
Specify the AWS region in which cloud resources will be created.
Specify the directory containing the files for the component CredentialsRequest objects.
Optional: Specify the directory in which you want the ccoctl utility to create objects. By default, the utility creates objects in the directory in which the commands are run.
Optional: By default, the ccoctl utility stores the OpenID Connect (OIDC) configuration files in a public S3 bucket and uses the S3 URL as the public OIDC endpoint. To store the OIDC configuration in a private S3 bucket that is accessed by the IAM identity provider through a public CloudFront distribution URL instead, use the --create-private-s3-bucket parameter.

[NOTE]
----
If your cluster uses Technology Preview features that are enabled by the TechPreviewNoUpgrade feature set, you must include the --enable-tech-preview parameter.
----

* To verify that the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform secrets are created, list the files in the <path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/manifests directory:

```terminal
$ ls <path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/manifests
```

Example output

```text
cluster-authentication-02-config.yaml
openshift-cloud-credential-operator-cloud-credential-operator-iam-ro-creds-credentials.yaml
openshift-cloud-network-config-controller-cloud-credentials-credentials.yaml
openshift-cluster-api-capa-manager-bootstrap-credentials-credentials.yaml
openshift-cluster-csi-drivers-ebs-cloud-credentials-credentials.yaml
openshift-image-registry-installer-cloud-credentials-credentials.yaml
openshift-ingress-operator-cloud-credentials-credentials.yaml
openshift-machine-api-aws-cloud-credentials-credentials.yaml
```


You can verify that the IAM roles are created by querying AWS. For more information, refer to AWS documentation on listing IAM roles.

#### Creating AWS resources individually

You can use the ccoctl tool to create AWS resources individually. This option might be useful for an organization that shares the responsibility for creating these resources among different users or departments.

Otherwise, you can use the ccoctl aws create-all command to create the AWS resources automatically. For more information, see "Creating AWS resources with a single command".


[NOTE]
----
By default, ccoctl creates objects in the directory in which the commands are run. To create the objects in a different directory, use the --output-dir flag. This procedure uses <path_to_ccoctl_output_dir> to refer to this directory.
Some ccoctl commands make AWS API calls to create or modify AWS resources. You can use the --dry-run flag to avoid making API calls. Using this flag creates JSON files on the local file system instead. You can review and modify the JSON files and then apply them with the AWS CLI tool using the --cli-input-json parameters.
----

* Extract and prepare the ccoctl binary.

1. Generate the public and private RSA key files that are used to set up the OpenID Connect provider for the cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ ccoctl aws create-key-pair
```

Example output

```text
2021/04/13 11:01:02 Generating RSA keypair
2021/04/13 11:01:03 Writing private key to /<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/serviceaccount-signer.private
2021/04/13 11:01:03 Writing public key to /<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/serviceaccount-signer.public
2021/04/13 11:01:03 Copying signing key for use by installer
```


where serviceaccount-signer.private and serviceaccount-signer.public are the generated key files.

This command also creates a private key that the cluster requires during installation in /<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/tls/bound-service-account-signing-key.key.
2. Create an OpenID Connect identity provider and S3 bucket on AWS by running the following command:

```terminal
$ ccoctl aws create-identity-provider \
  --name=<name> \1
  --region=<aws_region> \2
  --public-key-file=<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/serviceaccount-signer.public 3
```

<name> is the name used to tag any cloud resources that are created for tracking.
<aws-region> is the AWS region in which cloud resources will be created.
<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir> is the path to the public key file that the ccoctl aws create-key-pair command generated.
Example output

```text
2021/04/13 11:16:09 Bucket <name>-oidc created
2021/04/13 11:16:10 OpenID Connect discovery document in the S3 bucket <name>-oidc at .well-known/openid-configuration updated
2021/04/13 11:16:10 Reading public key
2021/04/13 11:16:10 JSON web key set (JWKS) in the S3 bucket <name>-oidc at keys.json updated
2021/04/13 11:16:18 Identity Provider created with ARN: arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_id>:oidc-provider/<name>-oidc.s3.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com
```


where openid-configuration is a discovery document and keys.json is a JSON web key set file.

This command also creates a YAML configuration file in /<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/manifests/cluster-authentication-02-config.yaml. This file sets the issuer URL field for the service account tokens that the cluster generates, so that the AWS IAM identity provider trusts the tokens.
3. Create IAM roles for each component in the cluster:
1. Set a $RELEASE_IMAGE variable with the release image from your installation file by running the following command:

```terminal
$ RELEASE_IMAGE=$(./openshift-install version | awk '/release image/ {print $3}')
```

2. Extract the list of CredentialsRequest objects from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release image:

```terminal
$ oc adm release extract \
  --from=$RELEASE_IMAGE \
  --credentials-requests \
  --included \1
  --install-config=<path_to_directory_with_installation_configuration>/install-config.yaml \2
  --to=<path_to_directory_for_credentials_requests> 3
```

The --included parameter includes only the manifests that your specific cluster configuration requires.
Specify the location of the install-config.yaml file.
Specify the path to the directory where you want to store the CredentialsRequest objects. If the specified directory does not exist, this command creates it.
3. Use the ccoctl tool to process all CredentialsRequest objects by running the following command:

```terminal
$ ccoctl aws create-iam-roles \
  --name=<name> \
  --region=<aws_region> \
  --credentials-requests-dir=<path_to_credentials_requests_directory> \
  --identity-provider-arn=arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_id>:oidc-provider/<name>-oidc.s3.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com
```


[NOTE]
----
For AWS environments that use alternative IAM API endpoints, such as GovCloud, you must also specify your region with the --region parameter.
If your cluster uses Technology Preview features that are enabled by the TechPreviewNoUpgrade feature set, you must include the --enable-tech-preview parameter.
----

For each CredentialsRequest object, ccoctl creates an IAM role with a trust policy that is tied to the specified OIDC identity provider, and a permissions policy as defined in each CredentialsRequest object from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release image.

* To verify that the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform secrets are created, list the files in the <path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/manifests directory:

```terminal
$ ls <path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/manifests
```

Example output

```text
cluster-authentication-02-config.yaml
openshift-cloud-credential-operator-cloud-credential-operator-iam-ro-creds-credentials.yaml
openshift-cloud-network-config-controller-cloud-credentials-credentials.yaml
openshift-cluster-api-capa-manager-bootstrap-credentials-credentials.yaml
openshift-cluster-csi-drivers-ebs-cloud-credentials-credentials.yaml
openshift-image-registry-installer-cloud-credentials-credentials.yaml
openshift-ingress-operator-cloud-credentials-credentials.yaml
openshift-machine-api-aws-cloud-credentials-credentials.yaml
```


You can verify that the IAM roles are created by querying AWS. For more information, refer to AWS documentation on listing IAM roles.

### Incorporating the Cloud Credential Operator utility manifests

To implement short-term security credentials managed outside the cluster for individual components, you must move the manifest files that the Cloud Credential Operator utility (ccoctl) created to the correct directories for the installation program.

* You have configured an account with the cloud platform that hosts your cluster.
* You have configured the Cloud Credential Operator utility (ccoctl).
* You have created the cloud provider resources that are required for your cluster with the ccoctl utility.

1. If you did not set the credentialsMode parameter in the install-config.yaml configuration file to Manual, modify the value as shown:
Sample configuration file snippet

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
credentialsMode: Manual
# ...
```

2. If you have not previously created installation manifest files, do so by running the following command:

```terminal
$ openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory>
```


where <installation_directory> is the directory in which the installation program creates files.
3. Copy the manifests that the ccoctl utility generated to the manifests directory that the installation program created by running the following command:

```terminal
$ cp /<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/manifests/* ./manifests/
```

4. Copy the tls directory that contains the private key to the installation directory:

```terminal
$ cp -a /<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/tls .
```


# Cluster Network Operator configuration

The configuration for the cluster network is specified as part of the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) configuration and stored in a custom resource (CR) object that is named cluster. The CR specifies the fields for the Network API in the operator.openshift.io API group.

The CNO configuration inherits the following fields during cluster installation from the Network API in the Network.config.openshift.io API group:

clusterNetwork:: IP address pools from which pod IP addresses are allocated.
serviceNetwork:: IP address pool for services.
defaultNetwork.type:: Cluster network plugin. OVNKubernetes is the only supported plugin during installation.

You can specify the cluster network plugin configuration for your cluster by setting the fields for the defaultNetwork object in the CNO object named cluster.

## Cluster Network Operator configuration object

The fields for the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) are described in the following table:




[IMPORTANT]
----
For a cluster that needs to deploy objects across multiple networks, ensure that you specify the same value for the clusterNetwork.hostPrefix parameter for each network type that is defined in the install-config.yaml file. Setting a different value for each clusterNetwork.hostPrefix parameter can impact the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, where the plugin cannot effectively route object traffic among different nodes.
----

### defaultNetwork object configuration

The values for the defaultNetwork object are defined in the following table:



#### Configuration for the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin

The following table describes the configuration fields for the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin:


















```yaml
defaultNetwork:
  type: OVNKubernetes
  ovnKubernetesConfig:
    mtu: 1400
    genevePort: 6081
    ipsecConfig:
      mode: Full
```


# Specifying advanced network configuration

You can use advanced network configuration for your network plugin to integrate your cluster into your existing network environment.

You can specify advanced network configuration only before you install the cluster.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Customizing your network configuration by modifying the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform manifest files created by the installation program is not supported. Applying a manifest file that you create, as in the following procedure, is supported.
----

* You have created the install-config.yaml file and completed any modifications to it.

1. Change to the directory that contains the installation program and create the manifests:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory> 1
```

<installation_directory> specifies the name of the directory that contains the install-config.yaml file for your cluster.
2. Create a stub manifest file for the advanced network configuration that is named cluster-network-03-config.yml in the <installation_directory>/manifests/ directory:

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
```

3. Specify the advanced network configuration for your cluster in the cluster-network-03-config.yml file, such as in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  defaultNetwork:
    ovnKubernetesConfig:
      ipsecConfig:
        mode: Full
```
4. Optional: Back up the manifests/cluster-network-03-config.yml file. The
installation program consumes the manifests/ directory when you create the
Ignition config files.
5. Remove the Kubernetes manifest files that define the control plane machines and compute MachineSets:

```terminal
$ rm -f openshift/99_openshift-cluster-api_master-machines-*.yaml openshift/99_openshift-cluster-api_worker-machineset-*.yaml
```


Because you create and manage these resources yourself, you do not have
to initialize them.
* You can preserve the MachineSet files to create compute machines by using the machine API, but you must update references to them to match your environment.

# Configuring an Ingress Controller Network Load Balancer on a new AWS cluster

You can create an Ingress Controller backed by an AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB) on a new cluster.

* Create the install-config.yaml file and complete any modifications to it.

Create an Ingress Controller backed by an AWS NLB on a new cluster.

1. Change to the directory that contains the installation program and create the manifests:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory> 1
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the name of the directory that
contains the install-config.yaml file for your cluster.
2. Create a file that is named cluster-ingress-default-ingresscontroller.yaml in the <installation_directory>/manifests/ directory:

```terminal
$ touch <installation_directory>/manifests/cluster-ingress-default-ingresscontroller.yaml 1
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the directory name that contains the
manifests/ directory for your cluster.

After creating the file, several network configuration files are in the
manifests/ directory, as shown:

```terminal
$ ls <installation_directory>/manifests/cluster-ingress-default-ingresscontroller.yaml
```

Example output

```terminal
cluster-ingress-default-ingresscontroller.yaml
```

3. Open the cluster-ingress-default-ingresscontroller.yaml file in an editor and enter a custom resource (CR) that describes the Operator configuration you want:

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: IngressController
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: default
  namespace: openshift-ingress-operator
spec:
  endpointPublishingStrategy:
    loadBalancer:
      scope: External
      providerParameters:
        type: AWS
        aws:
          type: NLB
    type: LoadBalancerService
```

4. Save the cluster-ingress-default-ingresscontroller.yaml file and quit the text editor.
5. Optional: Back up the manifests/cluster-ingress-default-ingresscontroller.yaml file. The installation program deletes the manifests/ directory when creating the cluster.

# Configuring hybrid networking with OVN-Kubernetes

You can configure your cluster to use hybrid networking with the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin. This allows a hybrid cluster that supports different node networking configurations.


[NOTE]
----
This configuration is necessary to run both Linux and Windows nodes in the same cluster.
----

* You defined OVNKubernetes for the networking.networkType parameter in the install-config.yaml file. See the installation documentation for configuring Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform network customizations on your chosen cloud provider for more information.

1. Change to the directory that contains the installation program and create the manifests:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory>
```

where:
<installation_directory>:: Specifies the name of the directory that contains the install-config.yaml file for your cluster.
2. Create a stub manifest file for the advanced network configuration that is named cluster-network-03-config.yml in the <installation_directory>/manifests/ directory:

```terminal
$ cat <<EOF > <installation_directory>/manifests/cluster-network-03-config.yml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
EOF
```

where:
<installation_directory>:: Specifies the directory name that contains the
manifests/ directory for your cluster.
3. Open the cluster-network-03-config.yml file in an editor and configure OVN-Kubernetes with hybrid networking, as in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  defaultNetwork:
    ovnKubernetesConfig:
      hybridOverlayConfig:
        hybridClusterNetwork: 1
        - cidr: 10.132.0.0/14
          hostPrefix: 23
        hybridOverlayVXLANPort: 9898 2
```

Specify the CIDR configuration used for nodes on the additional overlay network. The hybridClusterNetwork CIDR must not overlap with the clusterNetwork CIDR.
Specify a custom VXLAN port for the additional overlay network. This is required for running Windows nodes in a cluster installed on vSphere, and must not be configured for any other cloud provider. The custom port can be any open port excluding the default 4789 port. For more information on this requirement, see the Microsoft documentation on Pod-to-pod connectivity between hosts is broken.

[NOTE]
----
Windows Server Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC): Windows Server 2019 is not supported on clusters with a custom hybridOverlayVXLANPort value because this Windows server version does not support selecting a custom VXLAN port.
----
4. Save the cluster-network-03-config.yml file and quit the text editor.
5. Optional: Back up the manifests/cluster-network-03-config.yml file. The
installation program deletes the manifests/ directory when creating the
cluster.


[NOTE]
----

# Deploying the cluster

You can install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on a compatible cloud platform.


[IMPORTANT]
----
You can run the create cluster command of the installation program only once, during initial installation.
----

* You have configured an account with the cloud platform that hosts your cluster.
* You have the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.
* You have verified that the cloud provider account on your host has the correct permissions to deploy the cluster. An account with incorrect permissions causes the installation process to fail with an error message that displays the missing permissions.

1. In the directory that contains the installation program, initialize the cluster deployment by running the following command:

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install create cluster --dir <installation_directory> \ 1
    --log-level=info 2
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the
location of your customized ./install-config.yaml file.
To view different installation details, specify warn, debug, or
error instead of info.
2. Optional: Remove or disable the AdministratorAccess policy from the IAM
account that you used to install the cluster.

[NOTE]
----
The elevated permissions provided by the AdministratorAccess policy are required only during installation.
----

When the cluster deployment completes successfully:

* The terminal displays directions for accessing your cluster, including a link to the web console and credentials for the kubeadmin user.
* Credential information also outputs to <installation_directory>/.openshift_install.log.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not delete the installation program or the files that the installation program creates. Both are required to delete the cluster.
----


```terminal
...
INFO Install complete!
INFO To access the cluster as the system:admin user when using 'oc', run 'export KUBECONFIG=/home/myuser/install_dir/auth/kubeconfig'
INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.mycluster.example.com
INFO Login to the console with user: "kubeadmin", and password: "password"
INFO Time elapsed: 36m22s
```



[IMPORTANT]
----
* The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours, which are then renewed at that time. If the cluster is shut down before renewing the certificates and the cluster is later restarted after the 24 hours have elapsed, the cluster automatically recovers the expired certificates. The exception is that you must manually approve the pending node-bootstrapper certificate signing requests (CSRs) to recover kubelet certificates. See the documentation for Recovering from expired control plane certificates for more information.
* It is recommended that you use Ignition config files within 12 hours after they are generated because the 24-hour certificate rotates from 16 to 22 hours after the cluster is installed. By using the Ignition config files within 12 hours, you can avoid installation failure if the certificate update runs during installation.
----

# Logging in to the cluster by using the CLI

You can log in to your cluster as a default system user by exporting the cluster kubeconfig file.
The kubeconfig file contains information about the cluster that is used by the CLI to connect a client to the correct cluster and API server.
The file is specific to a cluster and is created during Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation.

* You deployed an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

1. Export the kubeadmin credentials by running the following command:

```terminal
$ export KUBECONFIG=<installation_directory>/auth/kubeconfig 1
```

For <installation_directory>, specify the path to the directory that you stored
the installation files in.
2. Verify you can run oc commands successfully using the exported configuration by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc whoami
```

Example output

```terminal
system:admin
```


# Logging in to the cluster by using the web console

The kubeadmin user exists by default after an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation. You can log in to your cluster as the kubeadmin user by using the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

* You have access to the installation host.
* You completed a cluster installation and all cluster Operators are available.

1. Obtain the password for the kubeadmin user from the kubeadmin-password file on the installation host:

```terminal
$ cat <installation_directory>/auth/kubeadmin-password
```


[NOTE]
----
Alternatively, you can obtain the kubeadmin password from the <installation_directory>/.openshift_install.log log file on the installation host.
----
2. List the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console route:

```terminal
$ oc get routes -n openshift-console | grep 'console-openshift'
```


[NOTE]
----
Alternatively, you can obtain the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform route from the <installation_directory>/.openshift_install.log log file on the installation host.
----
Example output

```terminal
console     console-openshift-console.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>            console     https   reencrypt/Redirect   None
```

3. Navigate to the route detailed in the output of the preceding command in a web browser and log in as the kubeadmin user.

* See Accessing the web console for more details about accessing and understanding the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

# Next steps

* Validating an installation.
* Customize your cluster.
* If necessary, you can opt out of remote health reporting.
* If necessary, you can remove cloud provider credentials.
