# Installation requirements for IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE infrastructure


Before you begin an installation on IBM Z(R) infrastructure, be sure that your IBM Z(R) environment meets the following installation requirements.
For a cluster that contains user-provisioned infrastructure, you must deploy all of the required machines.

# Required machines for cluster installation

The smallest Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters require the following hosts:




[IMPORTANT]
----
To improve high availability of your cluster, distribute the control plane machines over different hypervisor instances on at least two physical machines.
----

The bootstrap, control plane, and compute machines must use Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) as the operating system.

Note that RHCOS is based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9.2 and inherits all of its hardware certifications and requirements.
See Red Hat Enterprise Linux technology capabilities and limits.

## Minimum resource requirements for cluster installation

Each cluster machine must meet the following minimum requirements:



1. One physical core (IFL) provides two logical cores (threads) when SMT-2 is enabled. The hypervisor can provide two or more vCPUs.


[NOTE]
----
For Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.18, RHCOS is based on RHEL version 9.4, which updates the micro-architecture requirements. The following list contains the minimum instruction set architectures (ISA) that each architecture requires:
* x86-64 architecture requires x86-64-v2 ISA
* ARM64 architecture requires ARMv8.0-A ISA
* IBM Power architecture requires Power 9 ISA
* s390x architecture requires z14 ISA
For more information, see Architectures (RHEL documentation).
----

If an instance type for your platform meets the minimum requirements for cluster machines, it is supported to use in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

* See Bridging a HiperSockets LAN with a z/VM Virtual Switch in IBM(R) Documentation.
* See Scaling HyperPAV alias devices on Linux guests on z/VM for performance optimization.
* Processors Resource/Systems Manager Planning Guide in IBM(R) Documentation for PR/SM mode considerations.
* IBM Dynamic Partition Manager (DPM) Guide in IBM(R) Documentation for DPM mode considerations.
* Topics in LPAR performance for LPAR weight management and entitlements.
* Recommended host practices for IBM Z(R) & IBM(R) LinuxONE environments

## Minimum IBM Z system environment

The following IBM&#174; hardware is supported with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.18.



1. When running Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on IBM Z(R) without a hypervisor use the Dynamic Partition Manager (DPM) to manage your machine.
2. The RHEL KVM host in your environment must meet certain requirements to host the virtual machines that you plan for the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform environment. See Getting started with virtualization.

## Hardware requirements

* The equivalent of six Integrated Facilities for Linux (IFL), which are SMT2 enabled, for each cluster.
* At least one network connection to both connect to the LoadBalancer service and to serve data for traffic outside the cluster.


[IMPORTANT]
----
* You can use dedicated or shared IFLs to assign sufficient compute resources. Resource sharing is one of the key strengths of IBM Z(R). However, you must adjust the capacity correctly on each hypervisor layer and ensure that there are sufficient resources for every Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* Since the overall performance of the cluster can be impacted, the LPARs that are used to set up the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters must provide sufficient compute capacity. In this context, LPAR weight management, entitlements, and CPU shares on the hypervisor level play an important role. For more information, see "Recommended host practices for IBM Z & IBM LinuxONE environments".

## IBM Z operating system requirements



## IBM Z network connectivity



## Disk storage



## Preferred IBM Z system environment

The preferred system environment for running Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version 4.18 on IBM Z&#174; hardware is as follows:

## Hardware requirements

* Three logical partitions (LPARs) that each have the equivalent of six Integrated Facilities for Linux (IFLs), which are SMT2 enabled, for each cluster.
* Two network connections to both connect to the LoadBalancer service and to serve data for traffic outside the cluster.
* HiperSockets that are attached to a node directly as a device. To directly connect HiperSockets to a node, you must set up a gateway to the external network via a RHEL 8 guest to bridge to the HiperSockets network.

[NOTE]
----
When installing in a z/VM environment, you can also bridge HiperSockets with one z/VM VSWITCH to be transparent to the z/VM guest.
----

## IBM Z operating system requirements



1. To ensure the availability of integral components in an overcommitted environment, increase the priority of the control plane by using the CP command SET SHARE. Do the same for infrastructure nodes, if they exist. See SET SHARE (IBM(R) Documentation).

* Optimizing storage

## Certificate signing requests management

Because your cluster has limited access to automatic machine management when you use infrastructure that you provision, you must provide a mechanism for approving cluster certificate signing requests (CSRs) after installation. The kube-controller-manager only approves the kubelet client CSRs. The machine-approver cannot guarantee the validity of a serving certificate that is requested by using kubelet credentials because it cannot confirm that the correct machine issued the request. You must determine and implement a method of verifying the validity of the kubelet serving certificate requests and approving them.

## Networking requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure

All the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines require networking to be configured in initramfs during boot
to fetch their Ignition config files.

During the initial boot, the machines require an IP address configuration that is set either through a DHCP server or statically by providing the required boot options. After a network connection is established, the machines download their Ignition config files from an HTTP or HTTPS server. The Ignition config files are then used to set the exact state of each machine. The Machine Config Operator completes more changes to the machines, such as the application of new certificates or keys, after installation.

It is recommended to use a DHCP server for long-term management of the cluster machines. Ensure that the DHCP server is configured to provide persistent IP addresses, DNS server information, and hostnames to the cluster machines.


[NOTE]
----
If a DHCP service is not available for your user-provisioned infrastructure, you can instead provide the IP networking configuration and the address of the DNS server to the nodes at RHCOS install time. These can be passed as boot arguments if you are installing from an ISO image. See the Installing RHCOS and starting the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform bootstrap process section for more information about static IP provisioning and advanced networking options.
----

The Kubernetes API server must be able to resolve the node names of the cluster
machines. If the API servers and worker nodes are in different zones, you can
configure a default DNS search zone to allow the API server to resolve the
node names. Another supported approach is to always refer to hosts by their
fully-qualified domain names in both the node objects and all DNS requests.

### Setting the cluster node hostnames through DHCP

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines, the hostname is set through NetworkManager. By default, the machines obtain their hostname through DHCP. If the hostname is not provided by DHCP, set statically through kernel arguments, or another method, it is obtained through a reverse DNS lookup. Reverse DNS lookup occurs after the network has been initialized on a node and can take time to resolve. Other system services can start prior to this and detect the hostname as localhost or similar. You can avoid this by using DHCP to provide the hostname for each cluster node.

Additionally, setting the hostnames through DHCP can bypass any manual DNS record name configuration errors in environments that have a DNS split-horizon implementation.

### Network connectivity requirements

You must configure the network connectivity between machines to allow Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster
components to communicate. Each machine must be able to resolve the hostnames
of all other machines in the cluster.

This section provides details about the ports that are required.


[IMPORTANT]
----
In connected Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform environments, all nodes are required to have internet access to pull images
for platform containers and provide telemetry data to Red Hat.
----







## NTP configuration for user-provisioned infrastructure

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters are configured to use a public Network Time Protocol (NTP) server by default. If you want to use a local enterprise NTP server, or if your cluster is being deployed in a disconnected network, you can configure the cluster to use a specific time server. For more information, see the documentation for Configuring chrony time service.

If a DHCP server provides NTP server information, the chrony time service on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines read the information and can sync the clock with the NTP servers.

* Configuring chrony time service

## User-provisioned DNS requirements

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform deployments, DNS name resolution is required for the following components:

* The Kubernetes API
* The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform application wildcard
* The bootstrap, control plane, and compute machines

Reverse DNS resolution is also required for the Kubernetes API, the bootstrap machine, the control plane machines, and the compute machines.

DNS A/AAAA or CNAME records are used for name resolution and PTR records are used for reverse name resolution. The reverse records are important because Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) uses the reverse records to set the hostnames for all the nodes, unless the hostnames are provided by DHCP. Additionally, the reverse records are used to generate the certificate signing requests (CSR) that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform needs to operate.


[NOTE]
----
It is recommended to use a DHCP server to provide the hostnames to each cluster node. See the DHCP recommendations for user-provisioned infrastructure section for more information.
----

The following DNS records are required for a user-provisioned Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster and they must be in place before installation. In each record, <cluster_name> is the cluster name and <base_domain> is the base domain that you specify in the install-config.yaml file. A complete DNS record takes the form: <component>.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>..




[NOTE]
----
In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.4 and later, you do not need to specify etcd host and SRV records in your DNS configuration.
----


[TIP]
----
You can use the dig command to verify name and reverse name resolution. See the section on Validating DNS resolution for user-provisioned infrastructure for detailed validation steps.
----

### Example DNS configuration for user-provisioned clusters

This section provides A and PTR record configuration samples that meet the DNS requirements for deploying Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on user-provisioned infrastructure. The samples are not meant to provide advice for choosing one DNS solution over another.

In the examples, the cluster name is ocp4 and the base domain is example.com.

The following example is a BIND zone file that shows sample A records for name resolution in a user-provisioned cluster.

## Load balancing requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure

Before you install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, you must provision the API and application Ingress load balancing infrastructure. In production scenarios, you can deploy the API and application Ingress load balancers separately so that you can scale the load balancer infrastructure for each in isolation.


[NOTE]
----
If you want to deploy the API and application Ingress load balancers with a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) instance, you must purchase the RHEL subscription separately.
----

The load balancing infrastructure must meet the following requirements:

1. API load balancer: Provides a common endpoint for users, both human and machine, to interact with and configure the platform. Configure the following conditions:
* Layer 4 load balancing only. This can be referred to as Raw TCP or SSL Passthrough mode.
* A stateless load balancing algorithm. The options vary based on the load balancer implementation.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Do not configure session persistence for an API load balancer. Configuring session persistence for a Kubernetes API server might cause performance issues from excess application traffic for your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster and the Kubernetes API that runs inside the cluster.
----

Configure the following ports on both the front and back of the load balancers:
API load balancer


[NOTE]
----
The load balancer must be configured to take a maximum of 30 seconds from the
time the API server turns off the /readyz endpoint to the removal of the API
server instance from the pool. Within the time frame after /readyz returns an
error or becomes healthy, the endpoint must have been removed or added. Probing
every 5 or 10 seconds, with two successful requests to become healthy and three
to become unhealthy, are well-tested values.
----
2. Application Ingress load balancer: Provides an ingress point for application traffic flowing in from outside the cluster. A working configuration for the Ingress router is required for an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

Configure the following conditions:
* Layer 4 load balancing only. This can be referred to as Raw TCP or SSL Passthrough mode.
* A connection-based or session-based persistence is recommended, based on the options available and types of applications that will be hosted on the platform.

[TIP]
----
If the true IP address of the client can be seen by the application Ingress load balancer, enabling source IP-based session persistence can improve performance for applications that use end-to-end TLS encryption.
----

Configure the following ports on both the front and back of the load balancers:
Application Ingress load balancer


[NOTE]
----
If you are deploying a three-node cluster with zero compute nodes, the Ingress Controller pods run on the control plane nodes. In three-node cluster deployments, you must configure your application Ingress load balancer to route HTTP and HTTPS traffic to the control plane nodes.
----

### Example load balancer configuration for user-provisioned clusters

This section provides an example API and application Ingress load balancer configuration that meets the load balancing requirements for user-provisioned clusters. The sample is an /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg configuration for an HAProxy load balancer. The example is not meant to provide advice for choosing one load balancing solution over another.

In the example, the same load balancer is used for the Kubernetes API and application ingress traffic. In production scenarios, you can deploy the API and application ingress load balancers separately so that you can scale the load balancer infrastructure for each in isolation.


[NOTE]
----
If you are using HAProxy as a load balancer and SELinux is set to enforcing, you must ensure that the HAProxy service can bind to the configured TCP port by running setsebool -P haproxy_connect_any=1.

Port 6443 handles the Kubernetes API traffic and points to the control plane machines.
The bootstrap entries must be in place before the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster installation and they must be removed after the bootstrap process is complete.
Port 22623 handles the machine config server traffic and points to the control plane machines.
Port 443 handles the HTTPS traffic and points to the machines that run the Ingress Controller pods. The Ingress Controller pods run on the compute machines by default.
Port 80 handles the HTTP traffic and points to the machines that run the Ingress Controller pods. The Ingress Controller pods run on the compute machines by default.

[NOTE]
----
If you are deploying a three-node cluster with zero compute nodes, the Ingress Controller pods run on the control plane nodes. In three-node cluster deployments, you must configure your application Ingress load balancer to route HTTP and HTTPS traffic to the control plane nodes.
----


[TIP]
----
If you are using HAProxy as a load balancer, you can check that the haproxy process is listening on ports 6443, 22623, 443, and 80 by running netstat -nltupe on the HAProxy node.
