You can install the Secondary Scheduler Operator to run a custom secondary scheduler alongside the default scheduler to schedule pods.

# About the Secondary Scheduler Operator

The Secondary Scheduler Operator for Red Hat OpenShift provides a way to deploy a custom secondary scheduler in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. The secondary scheduler runs alongside the default scheduler to schedule pods. Pod configurations can specify which scheduler to use.

The custom scheduler must have the /bin/kube-scheduler binary and be based on the Kubernetes scheduling framework.


[IMPORTANT]
----
You can use the Secondary Scheduler Operator to deploy a custom secondary scheduler in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, but Red Hat does not directly support the functionality of the custom secondary scheduler.
----

The Secondary Scheduler Operator creates the default roles and role bindings required by the secondary scheduler. You can specify which scheduling plugins to enable or disable by configuring the KubeSchedulerConfiguration resource for the secondary scheduler.
