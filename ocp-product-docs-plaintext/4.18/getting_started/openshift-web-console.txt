# Creating and building an application using the web console



# Before you begin

* Review Accessing the web console.
* You must be able to access a running instance of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. If you do not have access, contact your cluster administrator.

# Logging in to the web console

You can log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console to access and manage your cluster.

* You must have access to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

* Log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console using your login credentials.

You are redirected to the Projects page. For non-administrative users, the default view is the Developer perspective. For cluster administrators, the default view is the Administrator perspective. If you do not have cluster-admin privileges, you will not see the Administrator perspective in your web console.

The web console provides two perspectives: the Administrator perspective and Developer perspective. The Developer perspective provides workflows specific to the developer use cases.

Use the perspective switcher to switch to the Developer perspective. The Topology view with options to create an application is displayed.

# Creating a new project

A project enables a community of users to organize and manage their content in isolation. Projects are Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform extensions to Kubernetes namespaces. Projects have additional features that enable user self-provisioning.

Users must receive access to projects from administrators. Cluster administrators can allow developers to create their own projects. In most cases, users automatically have access to their own projects.

Each project has its own set of objects, policies, constraints, and service accounts.

* You are logged in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.
* You are in the Developer perspective.
* You have the appropriate roles and permissions in a project to create applications and other workloads in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

1. In the +Add view, select Project -> Create Project.

# Granting view permissions

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform automatically creates a few special service accounts in every project. The default service account takes responsibility for running the pods. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform uses and injects this service account into every pod that launches.

The following procedure creates a RoleBinding object for the default ServiceAccount object. The service account communicates with the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform API to learn about pods, services, and resources within the project.

* You are logged in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.
* You have a deployed image.
* You are in the Administrator perspective.

1. Navigate to User Management and then click RoleBindings.
2. Click Create binding.
3. Select Namespace role binding (RoleBinding).
4. In the Name field, enter sa-user-account.
5. In the Namespace field, search for and select user-getting-started.
6. In the Role name field, search for view and select view.
7. In the Subject field, select ServiceAccount.
8. In the Subject namespace field, search for and select user-getting-started.

# Deploying your first image

The simplest way to deploy an application in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is to run an existing container image. The following procedure deploys a front end component of an application called national-parks-app. The web application displays an interactive map. The map displays the location of major national parks across the world.

* You are logged in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.
* You are in the Developer perspective.
* You have the appropriate roles and permissions in a project to create applications and other workloads in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

1. From the +Add view in the Developer perspective, click Container images to open a dialog.
2. In the Image Name field, enter the following: quay.io/openshiftroadshow/parksmap:latest
3. Ensure that you have the current values for the following:
1. Application: national-parks-app
2. Name: parksmap
4. Select Deployment as the Resource.
5. Select Create route to the application.
6. In the Advanced Options section, click Labels and add labels to better identify this deployment later. Labels help identify and filter components in the web console and in the command line. Add the following labels:
* app=national-parks-app
* component=parksmap
* role=frontend
7. Click Create.

You are redirected to the Topology page where you can see the parksmap deployment in the national-parks-app application.

## Examining the pod

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform leverages the Kubernetes concept of a pod, which is one or more containers deployed together on one host, and the smallest compute unit that can be defined, deployed, and managed.
Pods are the rough equivalent of a machine instance, physical or virtual, to a container.

The Overview panel enables you to access many features of the parksmap deployment. The Details and Resources tabs enable you to scale application pods, check build status, services, and routes.

* You are logged in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.
* You are in the Developer perspective.
* You have a deployed image.

* Click D parksmap in the Topology view to open the Overview panel.

## Scaling the application

In Kubernetes, a Deployment object defines how an application deploys. In most cases, users use Pod, Service, ReplicaSets, and Deployment resources together. In most cases, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform creates the resources for you.

When you deploy the national-parks-app image, a deployment resource is created.  In this example, only one Pod is deployed.

The following procedure scales the national-parks-image to use two instances.

* You are logged in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.
* You are in the Developer perspective.
* You have a deployed image.

1. In the Topology view, click the national-parks-app application.
2. Click the Details tab.
3. Use the up arrow to scale the pod to two instances.

[NOTE]
----
Application scaling can happen quickly because Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is launching a new instance of an existing image.
----
4. Use the down arrow to scale the pod down to one instance.

## Creating a secret

The Secret object provides a mechanism to hold sensitive information such as passwords, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform client configuration files, private source repository credentials, and so on.
Secrets decouple sensitive content from the pods. You can mount secrets into containers using a volume plugin or the system can use secrets to perform actions on behalf of a pod.
The following procedure adds the secret nationalparks-mongodb-parameters and mounts it to the nationalparks workload.

* You are logged in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.
* You are in the Developer perspective.
* You have a deployed image.

1. From the Developer perspective, navigate to Secrets on the left hand navigation and click Secrets.
2. Click Create -> Key/value secret.
