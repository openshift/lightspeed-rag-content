# Configuring the registry for bare metal


Configure image registry storage for bare-metal clusters after installation. Because bare-metal installations do not automatically provision storage, you must change the registry management state from Removed to Managed and configure persistent storage or use Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation before the registry can store container images.

# Image registry removed during installation

On platforms that do not provide shareable object storage, the OpenShift Image Registry Operator bootstraps itself as Removed. This allows openshift-installer to complete installations on these platform types.

After installation, you must edit the Image Registry Operator configuration to switch the managementState from Removed to Managed. When this has completed, you must configure storage.

# Changing the image registry's management state

To start the image registry, you must change the Image Registry Operator configuration&#8217;s managementState from Removed to Managed.

* Change managementState Image Registry Operator configuration from Removed to Managed. For example:

```terminal
$ oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io cluster --type merge --patch '{"spec":{"managementState":"Managed"}}'
```


# Image registry storage configuration

The Image Registry Operator is not initially available for platforms that do not provide default storage. After installation, you must configure your registry to use storage so that the Registry Operator is made available.

Configure a persistent volume, which is required for production clusters. Where applicable, you can configure an empty directory as the storage location for non-production clusters.

You can also allow the image registry to use block storage types by using the Recreate rollout strategy during upgrades.

## Configuring registry storage for bare metal and other manual installations

To ensure the registry is fully operational, configure the registry to use storage immediately after the cluster installation. This configuration is a mandatory step to enable the registry to store data.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You have a cluster
that uses manually-provisioned Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) nodes, such as bare metal.
* You have provisioned persistent storage for your cluster, such as Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform supports ReadWriteOnce access for image registry storage when you have only one replica. ReadWriteOnce access also requires that the registry uses the Recreate rollout strategy. To deploy an image registry that supports high availability with two or more replicas, ReadWriteMany access is required.
----
* You must have a system with at least 100Gi capacity.

1. To configure your registry to use storage, change the spec.storage.pvc in
the configs.imageregistry/cluster resource.

[NOTE]
----
When you use shared storage, review your security settings to prevent outside access.
----
2. Verify that you do not have a registry pod:

```terminal
$ oc get pod -n openshift-image-registry -l docker-registry=default
```

Example output

```terminal
No resources found in openshift-image-registry namespace
```


[NOTE]
----
If you do have a registry pod in your output, you do not need to continue with this procedure.
----
3. Check the registry configuration:

```terminal
$ oc edit configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io
```

Example output

```yaml
storage:
  pvc:
    claim:
```


Leave the claim field blank to allow the automatic creation of an
image-registry-storage PVC.
4. Check the clusteroperator status:

```terminal
$ oc get clusteroperator image-registry
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME             VERSION              AVAILABLE   PROGRESSING   DEGRADED   SINCE   MESSAGE
image-registry   4.18                 True        False         False      6h50m
```

5. Ensure that your registry is set to managed to enable building and pushing of images.
* Run:

```
$ oc edit configs.imageregistry/cluster
```


Then, change the line

```
managementState: Removed
```


to

```
managementState: Managed
```


## Configuring storage for the image registry in non-production clusters

You must configure storage for the Image Registry Operator. For non-production clusters, you can set the image registry to an empty directory. If you do so, all images are lost if you restart the registry.

* To set the image registry storage to an empty directory:

```terminal
$ oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io cluster --type merge --patch '{"spec":{"storage":{"emptyDir":{}}}}'
```


[WARNING]
----
Configure this option only for non-production clusters.
----

If you run this command before the Image Registry Operator initializes its
components, the oc patch command fails with the following error:

```terminal
Error from server (NotFound): configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io "cluster" not found
```


Wait a few minutes and run the command again.

## Configuring block registry storage for bare metal

To allow the image registry to use block storage types during upgrades as a cluster administrator, you can use the Recreate rollout strategy.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Block storage volumes, or block persistent volumes, are supported but not recommended for use with the image registry on production clusters. An installation where the registry is configured on block storage is not highly available because the registry cannot have more than one replica.
If you choose to use a block storage volume with the image registry, you must use a filesystem persistent volume claim (PVC).
----

1. Enter the following command to set the image registry storage as a block storage type, patch the registry so that it uses the Recreate rollout strategy, and runs with only one (1) replica:

```terminal
$ oc patch config.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"rolloutStrategy":"Recreate","replicas":1}}'
```

2. Provision the PV for the block storage device, and create a PVC for that volume. The requested block volume uses the ReadWriteOnce (RWO) access mode.
1. Create a pvc.yaml file with the following contents to define a VMware vSphere PersistentVolumeClaim object:

```yaml
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: image-registry-storage
  namespace: openshift-image-registry
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 100Gi
```


where:
name:: Specifies a unique name that represents the PersistentVolumeClaim object.
namespace:: Specifies the namespace for the PersistentVolumeClaim object, which is openshift-image-registry.
accessModes:: Specifies the access mode of the persistent volume claim. With ReadWriteOnce, the volume can be mounted with read and write permissions by a single node.
storage:: The size of the persistent volume claim.
2. Enter the following command to create the PersistentVolumeClaim object from the file:

```terminal
$ oc create -f pvc.yaml -n openshift-image-registry
```

3. Enter the following command to edit the registry configuration so that it references the correct PVC:

```terminal
$ oc edit config.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io -o yaml
```

Example output

```yaml
storage:
  pvc:
    claim:
```


By creating a custom PVC, you can leave the claim field blank for the default automatic creation of an image-registry-storage PVC.

# Configuring the Image Registry Operator to use CephFS storage with Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation

Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation integrates multiple storage types that you can use with the OpenShift image registry:

* Ceph, a shared and distributed file system and on-premise object storage
* NooBaa, providing a Multicloud Object Gateway

Use the following procedure to configure the image registry to use CephFS storage.


[NOTE]
----
CephFS uses persistent volume claim (PVC) storage. It is not recommended to use PVCs for image registry storage if there are other options are available, such as Ceph RGW or Noobaa.
----

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You have access to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.
* You installed the oc CLI.
* You installed the OpenShift Data Foundation Operator to provide object storage and CephFS file storage.

1. Create a PVC to use the cephfs storage class. For example:

```terminal
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
 name: registry-storage-pvc
 namespace: openshift-image-registry
spec:
 accessModes:
 - ReadWriteMany
 resources:
   requests:
     storage: 100Gi
 storageClassName: ocs-storagecluster-cephfs
EOF
```

2. Configure the image registry to use the CephFS file system storage by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc patch config.image/cluster -p '{"spec":{"managementState":"Managed","replicas":2,"storage":{"managementState":"Unmanaged","pvc":{"claim":"registry-storage-pvc"}}}}' --type=merge
```
