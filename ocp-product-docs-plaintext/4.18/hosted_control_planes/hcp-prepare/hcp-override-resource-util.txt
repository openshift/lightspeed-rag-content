# Overriding resource utilization measurements


The set of baseline measurements for resource utilization can vary in each hosted cluster.

# Overriding resource utilization measurements for a hosted cluster

You can override resource utilization measurements based on the type and pace of your cluster workload.

1. Create the ConfigMap resource by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f <your-config-map-file.yaml>
```


Replace <your-config-map-file.yaml> with the name of your YAML file that contains your hcp-sizing-baseline config map.
2. Create the hcp-sizing-baseline config map in the local-cluster namespace to specify the measurements you want to override. Your config map might resemble the following YAML file:

```yaml
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: hcp-sizing-baseline
  namespace: local-cluster
data:
  incrementalCPUUsagePer1KQPS: "9.0"
  memoryRequestPerHCP: "18"
  minimumQPSPerHCP: "50.0"
```

3. Delete the hypershift-addon-agent deployment to restart the hypershift-addon-agent pod by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete deployment hypershift-addon-agent \
  -n open-cluster-management-agent-addon
```


* Observe the hypershift-addon-agent pod logs. Verify that the overridden measurements are updated in the config map by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc logs hypershift-addon-agent -n open-cluster-management-agent-addon
```


Your logs might resemble the following output:
Example output

```terminal
2024-01-05T19:41:05.392Z	INFO	agent.agent-reconciler	agent/agent.go:793	setting cpuRequestPerHCP to 5
2024-01-05T19:41:05.392Z	INFO	agent.agent-reconciler	agent/agent.go:802	setting memoryRequestPerHCP to 18
2024-01-05T19:53:54.070Z	INFO	agent.agent-reconciler	agent/hcp_capacity_calculation.go:141	The worker nodes have 12.000000 vCPUs
2024-01-05T19:53:54.070Z	INFO	agent.agent-reconciler	agent/hcp_capacity_calculation.go:142	The worker nodes have 49.173369 GB memory
```


If the overridden measurements are not updated properly in the hcp-sizing-baseline config map, you might see the following error message in the hypershift-addon-agent pod logs:
Example error

```terminal
2024-01-05T19:53:54.052Z	ERROR	agent.agent-reconciler	agent/agent.go:788	failed to get configmap from the hub. Setting the HCP sizing baseline with default values.	{"error": "configmaps \"hcp-sizing-baseline\" not found"}
```


# Disabling the metric service monitoring

After you enable the hypershift-addon managed cluster add-on, metric service monitoring is configured by default so that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform monitoring can gather metrics from hypershift-addon.

You can disable metric service monitoring by completing the following steps:

1. Log in to your hub cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc login
```

2. Edit the hypershift-addon-deploy-config add-on deployment configuration specification by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc edit addondeploymentconfig hypershift-addon-deploy-config \
  -n multicluster-engine
```

3. Add the disableMetrics=true customized variable to the specification, as shown in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: addon.open-cluster-management.io/v1alpha1
kind: AddOnDeploymentConfig
metadata:
  name: hypershift-addon-deploy-config
  namespace: multicluster-engine
spec:
  customizedVariables:
  - name: hcMaxNumber
    value: "80"
  - name: hcThresholdNumber
    value: "60"
  - name: disableMetrics 1
    value: "true"
```

The disableMetrics=true customized variable disables metric service monitoring for both new and existing hypershift-addon managed cluster add-ons.
4. Apply the changes to the configuration specification by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <filename>.yaml
```
