# Configuring image streams and image registries


You can update the global pull secret for your cluster by either replacing the current pull secret or appending a new pull secret. The procedure is required when users use a separate registry to store images than the registry used during installation. For more information, see Using image pull secrets.
For information about images and configuring image streams or image registries, see the following documentation:
* Overview of images
* Image Registry Operator in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
* Configuring image registry settings

# Configuring image streams for a disconnected cluster

After installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform in a disconnected environment, configure the image streams for the Cluster Samples Operator and the must-gather image stream.

## Cluster Samples Operator assistance for mirroring

During installation, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform creates a config map named imagestreamtag-to-image in the openshift-cluster-samples-operator namespace. The imagestreamtag-to-image config map contains an entry, the populating image, for each image stream tag.

The format of the key for each entry in the data field in the config map is <image_stream_name>_<image_stream_tag_name>.

During a disconnected installation of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, the status of the Cluster Samples Operator is set to Removed. If you choose to change it to Managed, it installs samples.


[NOTE]
----
The use of samples in a network-restricted or discontinued environment may require access to services external to your network. Some example services include: Github, Maven Central, npm, RubyGems, PyPi and others. There might be additional steps to take that allow the cluster samples operators's objects to reach the services they require.
----

You can use this config map as a reference for which images need to be mirrored for your image streams to import.

* While the Cluster Samples Operator is set to Removed, you can create your mirrored registry, or determine which existing mirrored registry you want to use.
* Mirror the samples you want to the mirrored registry using the new config map as your guide.
* Add any of the image streams you did not mirror to the skippedImagestreams list of the Cluster Samples Operator configuration object.
* Set samplesRegistry of the Cluster Samples Operator configuration object to the mirrored registry.
* Then set the Cluster Samples Operator to Managed to install the image streams you have mirrored.

## Using Cluster Samples Operator image streams with alternate or mirrored registries

Most image streams in the openshift namespace managed by the Cluster Samples Operator
point to images located in the Red Hat registry at registry.redhat.io.


[NOTE]
----
The cli, installer, must-gather, and tests image streams, while
part of the install payload, are not managed by the Cluster Samples Operator. These are
not addressed in this procedure.
----


[IMPORTANT]
----
The Cluster Samples Operator must be set to Managed in a disconnected environment. To install the image streams, you have a mirrored registry.
----

* Access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* Create a pull secret for your mirror registry.

1. Access the images of a specific image stream to mirror, for example:

```terminal
$ oc get is <imagestream> -n openshift -o json | jq .spec.tags[].from.name | grep registry.redhat.io
```

2. Mirror images from registry.redhat.io associated with any image streams you need

```terminal
$ oc image mirror registry.redhat.io/rhscl/ruby-25-rhel7:latest ${MIRROR_ADDR}/rhscl/ruby-25-rhel7:latest
```

3. Create the cluster's image configuration object:

```terminal
$ oc create configmap registry-config --from-file=${MIRROR_ADDR_HOSTNAME}..5000=$path/ca.crt -n openshift-config
```

4. Add the required trusted CAs for the mirror in the cluster's image
configuration object:

```terminal
$ oc patch image.config.openshift.io/cluster --patch '{"spec":{"additionalTrustedCA":{"name":"registry-config"}}}' --type=merge
```

5. Update the samplesRegistry field in the Cluster Samples Operator configuration object
to contain the hostname portion of the mirror location defined in the mirror
configuration:

```terminal
$ oc edit configs.samples.operator.openshift.io -n openshift-cluster-samples-operator
```


[NOTE]
----
This is required because the image stream import process does not use the mirror or search mechanism at this time.
----
6. Add any image streams that are not mirrored into the skippedImagestreams field
of the Cluster Samples Operator configuration object. Or if you do not want to support
any of the sample image streams, set the Cluster Samples Operator to Removed in the
Cluster Samples Operator configuration object.

[NOTE]
----
The Cluster Samples Operator issues alerts if image stream imports are failing but the Cluster Samples Operator is either periodically retrying or does not appear to be retrying them.
----

Many of the templates in the openshift namespace
reference the image streams. So using Removed to purge both the image streams
and templates will eliminate the possibility of attempts to use them if they
are not functional because of any missing image streams.

## Preparing your cluster to gather support data

Clusters using a restricted network must import the default must-gather image to gather debugging data for Red Hat support. The must-gather image is not imported by default, and clusters on a restricted network do not have access to the internet to pull the latest image from a remote repository.

1. If you have not added your mirror registry's trusted CA to your cluster's image configuration object as part of the Cluster Samples Operator configuration, perform the following steps:
1. Create the cluster's image configuration object:

```terminal
$ oc create configmap registry-config --from-file=${MIRROR_ADDR_HOSTNAME}..5000=$path/ca.crt -n openshift-config
```

2. Add the required trusted CAs for the mirror in the cluster's image
configuration object:

```terminal
$ oc patch image.config.openshift.io/cluster --patch '{"spec":{"additionalTrustedCA":{"name":"registry-config"}}}' --type=merge
```

2. Import the default must-gather image from your installation payload:

```terminal
$ oc import-image is/must-gather -n openshift
```


When running the oc adm must-gather command, use the --image flag and point to the payload image, as in the following example:


```terminal
$ oc adm must-gather --image=$(oc adm release info --image-for must-gather)
```


# Configuring periodic importing of Cluster Sample Operator image stream tags

You can ensure that you always have access to the latest versions of the Cluster Sample Operator images by periodically importing the image stream tags when new versions become available.

1. Fetch all the imagestreams in the openshift namespace by running the following command:

```terminal
oc get imagestreams -n openshift
```

2. Fetch the tags for every imagestream in the openshift namespace by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get is <image-stream-name> -o jsonpath="{range .spec.tags[*]}{.name}{'\t'}{.from.name}{'\n'}{end}" -n openshift
```


For example:

```terminal
$ oc get is ubi8-openjdk-17 -o jsonpath="{range .spec.tags[*]}{.name}{'\t'}{.from.name}{'\n'}{end}" -n openshift
```

Example output

```terminal
1.11	registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/openjdk-17:1.11
1.12	registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/openjdk-17:1.12
```

3. Schedule periodic importing of images for each tag present in the image stream by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc tag <repository/image> <image-stream-name:tag> --scheduled -n openshift
```


For example:

```terminal
$ oc tag registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/openjdk-17:1.11 ubi8-openjdk-17:1.11 --scheduled -n openshift
```


```terminal
$ oc tag registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/openjdk-17:1.12 ubi8-openjdk-17:1.12 --scheduled -n openshift
```


[NOTE]
----
Using the --scheduled flag is recommended to periodically re-import an image when working with an external container image registry. The --scheduled flag helps to ensure that you receive the latest versions and security updates. Additionally, this setting allows the import process to automatically retry if a temporary error initially prevents the image from being imported.
By default, scheduled image imports occur every 15 minutes cluster-wide.
----
4. Verify the scheduling status of the periodic import by running the following command:

```terminal
oc get imagestream <image-stream-name> -o jsonpath="{range .spec.tags[*]}Tag: {.name}{'\t'}Scheduled: {.importPolicy.scheduled}{'\n'}{end}" -n openshift
```


For example:

```terminal
oc get imagestream ubi8-openjdk-17 -o jsonpath="{range .spec.tags[*]}Tag: {.name}{'\t'}Scheduled: {.importPolicy.scheduled}{'\n'}{end}" -n openshift
```

Example output

```terminal
Tag: 1.11	Scheduled: true
Tag: 1.12	Scheduled: true
```
