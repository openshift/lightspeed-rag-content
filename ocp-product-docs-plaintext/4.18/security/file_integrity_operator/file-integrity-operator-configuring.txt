# Configuring the Custom File Integrity Operator



# Viewing FileIntegrity object attributes

As with any Kubernetes custom resources (CRs), you can run oc explain fileintegrity, and then look at the individual attributes using:


```terminal
$ oc explain fileintegrity.spec
```



```terminal
$ oc explain fileintegrity.spec.config
```


# Important attributes



# Examine the default configuration

The default File Integrity Operator configuration is stored in a config map with
the same name as the FileIntegrity CR.

* To examine the default config, run:

```terminal
$ oc describe cm/worker-fileintegrity
```


# Understanding the default File Integrity Operator configuration

Below is an excerpt from the aide.conf key of the config map:


```bash
@@define DBDIR /hostroot/etc/kubernetes
@@define LOGDIR /hostroot/etc/kubernetes
database=file:@@{DBDIR}/aide.db.gz
database_out=file:@@{DBDIR}/aide.db.gz
gzip_dbout=yes
verbose=5
report_url=file:@@{LOGDIR}/aide.log
report_url=stdout
PERMS = p+u+g+acl+selinux+xattrs
CONTENT_EX = sha512+ftype+p+u+g+n+acl+selinux+xattrs

/hostroot/boot/    	CONTENT_EX
/hostroot/root/\..* PERMS
/hostroot/root/   CONTENT_EX
```


The default configuration for a FileIntegrity instance provides coverage for
files under the following directories:

* /root
* /boot
* /usr
* /etc

The following directories are not covered:

* /var
* /opt
* Some Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform-specific excludes under /etc/

# Supplying a custom AIDE configuration

Any entries that configure AIDE internal behavior such as DBDIR, LOGDIR,
database, and database_out are overwritten by the Operator. The Operator
would add a prefix to /hostroot/ before all paths to be watched for integrity
changes. This makes reusing existing AIDE configs that might often not be
tailored for a containerized environment and start from the root directory
easier.


[NOTE]
----
/hostroot is the directory where the pods running AIDE mount the host's
file system. Changing the configuration triggers a reinitializing of the database.

# Defining a custom File Integrity Operator configuration

This example focuses on defining a custom configuration for a scanner that runs
on the control plane nodes based on the default configuration provided for the
worker-fileintegrity CR. This workflow might be useful if you are planning
to deploy a custom software running as a daemon set and storing its data under
/opt/mydaemon on the control plane nodes.

1. Make a copy of the default configuration.
2. Edit the default configuration with the files that must be watched or excluded.
3. Store the edited contents in a new config map.
4. Point the FileIntegrity object to the new config map through the attributes in
spec.config.
5. Extract the default configuration:

```terminal
$ oc extract cm/worker-fileintegrity --keys=aide.conf
```


This creates a file named aide.conf that you can edit. To illustrate how the
Operator post-processes the paths, this example adds an exclude directory
without the prefix:

```terminal
$ vim aide.conf
```

Example output

```terminal
/hostroot/etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources
!/hostroot/etc/kubernetes/aide.*
!/hostroot/etc/kubernetes/manifests
!/hostroot/etc/docker/certs.d
!/hostroot/etc/selinux/targeted
!/hostroot/etc/openvswitch/conf.db
```


Exclude a path specific to control plane nodes:

```terminal
!/opt/mydaemon/
```


Store the other content in /etc:

```terminal
/hostroot/etc/	CONTENT_EX
```

6. Create a config map based on this file:

```terminal
$ oc create cm master-aide-conf --from-file=aide.conf
```

7. Define a FileIntegrity CR manifest that references the config map:

```yaml
apiVersion: fileintegrity.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: FileIntegrity
metadata:
  name: master-fileintegrity
  namespace: openshift-file-integrity
spec:
  nodeSelector:
      node-role.kubernetes.io/master: ""
  config:
      name: master-aide-conf
      namespace: openshift-file-integrity
```


The Operator processes the provided config map file and stores the result in a
config map with the same name as the FileIntegrity object:

```terminal
$ oc describe cm/master-fileintegrity | grep /opt/mydaemon
```

Example output

```terminal
!/hostroot/opt/mydaemon
```


# Changing the custom File Integrity configuration

To change the File Integrity configuration, never change the generated
config map. Instead, change the config map that is linked to the FileIntegrity
object through the spec.name, namespace, and key attributes.
