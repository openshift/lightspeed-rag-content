----
You can deploy the following operands by creating the respective custom resources (CRs). You must deploy the operands in the following sequence to ensure successful installation.
1. SPIRE Server
2. SPIRE Agent
3. SPIFFE CSI driver
4. SPIRE OIDC discovery provider

# Deploying the SPIRE server

You can configure the SpireServer custom resource (CR) to deploy and configure a SPIRE server.

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.
* You have installed Zero Trust Workload Identity Manager in the cluster.
.Procedure
1. Create the SpireServer CR:
1. Create a YAML file that defines the SpireServer CR, for example, SpireServer.yaml:
Example SpireServer.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: SpireServer
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  trustDomain: <trust_domain> 1
  clusterName: <cluster_name> 2
  caSubject:
    commonName: example.org 3
    country: "US" 4
    organization: "RH" 5
  persistence:
    type: pvc 6
    size: "5Gi" 7
    accessMode: ReadWriteOnce 8
  datastore:
    databaseType: sqlite3
    connectionString: "/run/spire/data/datastore.sqlite3"
    maxOpenConns: 100 9
    maxIdleConns: 2 10
    connMaxLifetime: 3600 11
  jwtIssuer: <jwt_issuer_domain> 12
```

The trust domain to be used for the SPIFFE identifiers.
The name of your cluster.
The common name for SPIRE server CA.
The country for SPIRE server CA.
The organization for SPIRE server CA.
The type of volume to be used for persistence. The valid options are pvc and hostPath.
The size of volume to be used for persistence
The access mode to be used for persistence. The valid options are ReadWriteOnce, ReadWriteOncePod, and ReadWriteMany.
The maximum number of open database connections.
The maximum number of idle connections in the pool.
The maximum amount of time a connection can be reused. To specify an unlimited time, you can set the value to 0.
The JSON Web Token (JWT) issuer domain. The default value is set to the value specified in oidc-discovery.$trustDomain.
2. Apply the configuration by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f SpireServer.yaml
```


1. Verify that the stateful set of SPIRE server is ready and available by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get statefulset -l app.kubernetes.io/name=server -n zero-trust-workload-identity-manager
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME            READY   AGE
spire-server    1/1     65s
```

2. Verify that the status of SPIRE server pod is Running by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get po -l app.kubernetes.io/name=server -n zero-trust-workload-identity-manager
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS        AGE
spire-server-0     2/2     Running   1 (108s ago)    111s
```

3. Verify that the persistent volume claim (PVC) is bound, by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/name=server -n zero-trust-workload-identity-manager
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                        STATUS    VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES  STORAGECLASS  VOLUMEATTRIBUTECLASS  AGE
spire-data-spire-server-0   Bound     pvc-27a36535-18a1-4fde-ab6d-e7ee7d3c2744   5Gi        RW0           gp3-csi       <unset>               22m
```

The type of verification to be done against kubelet. Valid options are auto, hostCert, apiServerCA, skip. The auto option initially attempts to use hostCert, and then falls back to apiServerCA.
2. Apply the configuration by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f SpireAgent.yaml
```


1. Verify that the daemon set of the SPIRE agent is ready and available by running the following command
