# Securing attached storage


Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform supports multiple types of storage, both
for on-premise and cloud providers. In particular,
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform can use storage types that support the Container
Storage Interface.

# Persistent volume plugins

Containers are useful for both stateless and stateful applications.
Protecting attached storage is a key element of securing stateful services.
Using the Container Storage Interface (CSI), Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform can
incorporate storage from any storage back end that supports the CSI interface.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform provides plugins for multiple types of storage, including:

* Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation *
* AWS Elastic Block Stores (EBS) *
* AWS Elastic File System (EFS) *
* Azure Disk *
* Azure File *
* OpenStack Cinder *
* GCE Persistent Disks *
* VMware vSphere *
* Network File System (NFS)
* FlexVolume
* Fibre Channel
* iSCSI

Plugins for those storage types with dynamic provisioning are marked with
an asterisk (*). Data in transit is encrypted via HTTPS for all
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform components communicating with each other.

You can mount a persistent volume (PV) on a host in any way supported by your
storage type. Different types of storage have different capabilities and each
PV&#8217;s access modes are set to the specific modes supported by that particular
volume.

For example, NFS can support multiple read/write clients, but a specific NFS PV
might be exported on the server as read-only. Each PV has its own set of access
modes describing that specific PV&#8217;s capabilities, such as ReadWriteOnce,
ReadOnlyMany, and ReadWriteMany.

# Shared storage

For shared storage providers like NFS, the PV registers its
group ID (GID) as an annotation on the PV resource. Then, when the PV is claimed
by the pod, the annotated GID is added to the supplemental groups of the pod,
giving that pod access to the contents of the shared storage.

# Block storage

For block storage providers like AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS), GCE Persistent
Disks, and iSCSI, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform uses SELinux capabilities to secure the root
of the mounted volume for non-privileged pods, making the mounted volume owned
by and only visible to the container with which it is associated.
