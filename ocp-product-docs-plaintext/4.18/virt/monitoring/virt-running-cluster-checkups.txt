# OpenShift Virtualization cluster checkup framework


OpenShift Virtualization includes the following predefined checkups that can be used for cluster maintenance and troubleshooting:
* Latency checkup, which verifies network connectivity and measures latency between two virtual machines (VMs) that are attached to a secondary network interface.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Before you run a latency checkup, you must first create a bridge interface on the cluster nodes to connect the VM's secondary interface to any interface on the node. If you do not create a bridge interface, the VMs do not start and the job fails.
----
* Storage checkup, which verifies if the cluster storage is optimally configured for OpenShift Virtualization.
* DPDK checkup, which verifies that a node can run a VM with a Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) workload with zero packet loss.

[IMPORTANT]
----
The OpenShift Virtualization cluster checkup framework is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

# About the OpenShift Virtualization cluster checkup framework

A checkup is an automated test workload that allows you to verify if a specific cluster functionality works as expected. The cluster checkup framework uses native Kubernetes resources to configure and execute the checkup.

By using predefined checkups, cluster administrators and developers can improve cluster maintainability, troubleshoot unexpected behavior, minimize errors, and save time. They can also review the results of the checkup and share them with experts for further analysis. Vendors can write and publish checkups for features or services that they provide and verify that their customer environments are configured correctly.

Running a predefined checkup in an existing namespace involves setting up a service account for the checkup, creating the Role and RoleBinding objects for the service account, enabling permissions for the checkup, and creating the input config map and the checkup job. You can run a checkup multiple times.


[IMPORTANT]
----
You must always:
* Verify that the checkup image is from a trustworthy source before applying it.
* Review the checkup permissions before creating the Role and RoleBinding objects.

# Running checkups by using the command line

Use the following procedures the first time you run checkups by using the command line.

## Running a latency checkup by using the command line

You use a predefined checkup to verify network connectivity and measure latency between two virtual machines (VMs) that are attached to a secondary network interface. The latency checkup uses the ping utility.

You run a latency checkup by performing the following steps:

1. Create a service account, roles, and rolebindings to provide cluster access permissions to the latency checkup.
2. Create a config map to provide the input to run the checkup and to store the results.
3. Create a job to run the checkup.
4. Review the results in the config map.
5. Optional: To rerun the checkup, delete the existing config map and job and then create a new config map and job.
6. When you are finished, delete the latency checkup resources.

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* The cluster has at least two worker nodes.
* You configured a network attachment definition for a namespace.

1. Create a ServiceAccount, Role, and RoleBinding manifest for the latency checkup:
Example role manifest file

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: vm-latency-checkup-sa
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: kubevirt-vm-latency-checker
rules:
- apiGroups: ["kubevirt.io"]
  resources: ["virtualmachineinstances"]
  verbs: ["get", "create", "delete"]
- apiGroups: ["subresources.kubevirt.io"]
  resources: ["virtualmachineinstances/console"]
  verbs: ["get"]
- apiGroups: ["k8s.cni.cncf.io"]
  resources: ["network-attachment-definitions"]
  verbs: ["get"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: kubevirt-vm-latency-checker
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: vm-latency-checkup-sa
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: kubevirt-vm-latency-checker
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: kiagnose-configmap-access
rules:
- apiGroups: [ "" ]
  resources: [ "configmaps" ]
  verbs: ["get", "update"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: kiagnose-configmap-access
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: vm-latency-checkup-sa
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: kiagnose-configmap-access
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```
2. Apply the ServiceAccount, Role, and RoleBinding manifest:

```terminal
$ oc apply -n <target_namespace> -f <latency_sa_roles_rolebinding>.yaml 1
```

<target_namespace> is the namespace where the checkup is to be run. This must be an existing namespace where the NetworkAttachmentDefinition object resides.
3. Create a ConfigMap manifest that contains the input parameters for the checkup:
Example input config map

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: kubevirt-vm-latency-checkup-config
  labels:
    kiagnose/checkup-type: kubevirt-vm-latency
data:
  spec.timeout: 5m
  spec.param.networkAttachmentDefinitionNamespace: <target_namespace>
  spec.param.networkAttachmentDefinitionName: "blue-network" 1
  spec.param.maxDesiredLatencyMilliseconds: "10" 2
  spec.param.sampleDurationSeconds: "5" 3
  spec.param.sourceNode: "worker1" 4
  spec.param.targetNode: "worker2" 5
```

The name of the NetworkAttachmentDefinition object.
Optional: The maximum desired latency, in milliseconds, between the virtual machines. If the measured latency exceeds this value, the checkup fails.
Optional: The duration of the latency check, in seconds.
Optional: When specified, latency is measured from this node to the target node. If the source node is specified, the spec.param.targetNode field cannot be empty.
Optional: When specified, latency is measured from the source node to this node.
4. Apply the config map manifest in the target namespace:

```terminal
$ oc apply -n <target_namespace> -f <latency_config_map>.yaml
```

5. Create a Job manifest to run the checkup:
Example job manifest

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: kubevirt-vm-latency-checkup
  labels:
    kiagnose/checkup-type: kubevirt-vm-latency
spec:
  backoffLimit: 0
  template:
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: vm-latency-checkup-sa
      restartPolicy: Never
      containers:
        - name: vm-latency-checkup
          image: registry.redhat.io/container-native-virtualization/vm-network-latency-checkup-rhel9:v4.18.0
          securityContext:
            allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
            capabilities:
              drop: ["ALL"]
            runAsNonRoot: true
            seccompProfile:
              type: "RuntimeDefault"
          env:
            - name: CONFIGMAP_NAMESPACE
              value: <target_namespace>
            - name: CONFIGMAP_NAME
              value: kubevirt-vm-latency-checkup-config
            - name: POD_UID
              valueFrom:
                fieldRef:
                  fieldPath: metadata.uid
```

6. Apply the Job manifest:

```terminal
$ oc apply -n <target_namespace> -f <latency_job>.yaml
```

7. Wait for the job to complete:

```terminal
$ oc wait job kubevirt-vm-latency-checkup -n <target_namespace> --for condition=complete --timeout 6m
```

8. Review the results of the latency checkup by running the following command. If the maximum measured latency is greater than the value of the spec.param.maxDesiredLatencyMilliseconds attribute, the checkup fails and returns an error.

```terminal
$ oc get configmap kubevirt-vm-latency-checkup-config -n <target_namespace> -o yaml
```

Example output config map (success)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: kubevirt-vm-latency-checkup-config
  namespace: <target_namespace>
  labels:
    kiagnose/checkup-type: kubevirt-vm-latency
data:
  spec.timeout: 5m
  spec.param.networkAttachmentDefinitionNamespace: <target_namespace>
  spec.param.networkAttachmentDefinitionName: "blue-network"
  spec.param.maxDesiredLatencyMilliseconds: "10"
  spec.param.sampleDurationSeconds: "5"
  spec.param.sourceNode: "worker1"
  spec.param.targetNode: "worker2"
  status.succeeded: "true"
  status.failureReason: ""
  status.completionTimestamp: "2022-01-01T09:00:00Z"
  status.startTimestamp: "2022-01-01T09:00:07Z"
  status.result.avgLatencyNanoSec: "177000"
  status.result.maxLatencyNanoSec: "244000" 1
  status.result.measurementDurationSec: "5"
  status.result.minLatencyNanoSec: "135000"
  status.result.sourceNode: "worker1"
  status.result.targetNode: "worker2"
```

The maximum measured latency in nanoseconds.
9. Optional: To view the detailed job log in case of checkup failure, use the following command:

```terminal
$ oc logs job.batch/kubevirt-vm-latency-checkup -n <target_namespace>
```

10. Delete the job and config map that you previously created by running the following commands:

```terminal
$ oc delete job -n <target_namespace> kubevirt-vm-latency-checkup
```


```terminal
$ oc delete config-map -n <target_namespace> kubevirt-vm-latency-checkup-config
```

11. Optional: If you do not plan to run another checkup, delete the roles manifest:

```terminal
$ oc delete -f <latency_sa_roles_rolebinding>.yaml
```


## Running a storage checkup by using the command line

Use a predefined checkup to verify that the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster storage is configured optimally to run OpenShift Virtualization workloads.

* The cluster administrator has created the required cluster-reader permissions for the storage checkup service account and namespace, such as in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: kubevirt-storage-checkup-clustereader
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-reader
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: storage-checkup-sa
  namespace: <target_namespace> 1
```

## Running a DPDK checkup by using the command line

Use a predefined checkup to verify that your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster node can run a virtual machine (VM) with a Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) workload with zero packet loss. The DPDK checkup runs traffic between a traffic generator and a VM running a test DPDK application.

You run a DPDK checkup by performing the following steps:

1. Create a service account, role, and role bindings for the DPDK checkup.
2. Create a config map to provide the input to run the checkup and to store the results.
3. Create a job to run the checkup.
4. Review the results in the config map.
5. Optional: To rerun the checkup, delete the existing config map and job and then create a new config map and job.
6. When you are finished, delete the DPDK checkup resources.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* The cluster is configured to run DPDK applications.
* The project is configured to run DPDK applications.

9. Delete the job and config map that you previously created by running the following commands:

```terminal
$ oc delete job -n <target_namespace> dpdk-checkup
```


```terminal
$ oc delete config-map -n <target_namespace> dpdk-checkup-config
```

10. Optional: If you do not plan to run another checkup, delete the ServiceAccount, Role, and RoleBinding manifest:

```terminal
$ oc delete -f <dpdk_sa_roles_rolebinding>.yaml
```


### DPDK checkup config map parameters

The following table shows the mandatory and optional parameters that you can set in the data stanza of the input ConfigMap manifest when you run a cluster DPDK readiness checkup:



### Building a container disk image for RHEL virtual machines

You can build a custom Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9 OS image in qcow2 format and use it to create a container disk image. You can store the container disk image in a registry that is accessible from your cluster and specify the image location in the spec.param.vmContainerDiskImage attribute of the DPDK checkup config map.

To build a container disk image, you must create an image builder virtual machine (VM). The image builder VM is a RHEL 9 VM that can be used to build custom RHEL images.

* The image builder VM must run RHEL 9.4 and must have a minimum of 2 CPU cores, 4 GiB RAM, and 20 GB of free space in the /var directory.
* You have installed the image builder tool and its CLI (composer-cli) on the VM. For more information, see "Additional resources".
* You have installed the virt-customize tool:

```terminal
# dnf install guestfs-tools
```

* You have installed the Podman CLI tool (podman).

1. Verify that you can build a RHEL 9.4 image:

```terminal
# composer-cli distros list
```


[NOTE]
----
To run the composer-cli commands as non-root, add your user to the weldr or root groups:

```terminal
# usermod -a -G weldr <user>
```


```terminal
$ newgrp weldr
```

----
2. Enter the following command to create an image blueprint file in TOML format that contains the packages to be installed, kernel customizations, and the services to be disabled during boot time:

```terminal
$ cat << EOF > dpdk-vm.toml
name = "dpdk_image"
description = "Image to use with the DPDK checkup"
version = "0.0.1"
distro = "rhel-9.4"

[[customizations.user]]
name = "root"
password = "redhat"

[[packages]]
name = "dpdk"

[[packages]]
name = "dpdk-tools"

[[packages]]
name = "driverctl"

[[packages]]
name = "tuned-profiles-cpu-partitioning"

[customizations.kernel]
append = "default_hugepagesz=1GB hugepagesz=1G hugepages=1"

[customizations.services]
disabled = ["NetworkManager-wait-online", "sshd"]
EOF
```

3. Push the blueprint file to the image builder tool by running the following command:

```terminal
# composer-cli blueprints push dpdk-vm.toml
```

4. Generate the system image by specifying the blueprint name and output file format. The Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) of the image is displayed when you start the compose process.

```terminal
# composer-cli compose start dpdk_image qcow2
```

5. Wait for the compose process to complete. The compose status must show FINISHED before you can continue to the next step.

```terminal
# composer-cli compose status
```

6. Enter the following command to download the qcow2 image file by specifying its UUID:

```terminal
# composer-cli compose image <UUID>
```

7. Create the customization scripts by running the following commands:

```terminal
$ cat <<EOF >customize-vm
#!/bin/bash

# Setup hugepages mount
mkdir -p /mnt/huge
echo "hugetlbfs /mnt/huge hugetlbfs defaults,pagesize=1GB 0 0" >> /etc/fstab

# Create vfio-noiommu.conf
echo "options vfio enable_unsafe_noiommu_mode=1" > /etc/modprobe.d/vfio-noiommu.conf

# Enable guest-exec,guest-exec-status on the qemu-guest-agent configuration
sed -i 's/\(--allow-rpcs=[^"]*\)/\1,guest-exec-status,guest-exec/' /etc/sysconfig/qemu-ga

# Disable Bracketed-paste mode
echo "set enable-bracketed-paste off" >> /root/.inputrc
EOF
```

8. Use the virt-customize tool to customize the image generated by the image builder tool:

```terminal
$ virt-customize -a <UUID>-disk.qcow2 --run=customize-vm --selinux-relabel
```

9. To create a Dockerfile that contains all the commands to build the container disk image, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ cat << EOF > Dockerfile
FROM scratch
COPY --chown=107:107 <UUID>-disk.qcow2 /disk/
EOF
```


where:
<UUID>-disk.qcow2:: Specifies the name of the custom image in qcow2 format.
10. Build and tag the container by running the following command:

```terminal
$ podman build . -t dpdk-rhel:latest
```

11. Push the container disk image to a registry that is accessible from your cluster by running the following command:

```terminal
$ podman push dpdk-rhel:latest
```

12. Provide a link to the container disk image in the spec.param.vmUnderTestContainerDiskImage attribute in the DPDK checkup config map.
