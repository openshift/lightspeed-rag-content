# Scheduling virtual machines


You can schedule a virtual machine (VM) on a node by ensuring that the VM's CPU model and policy attribute are matched for compatibility with the CPU models and policy attributes supported by the node.

# Policy attributes

You can schedule a virtual machine (VM) by specifying a policy attribute and a CPU feature that is matched for compatibility when the VM is scheduled on a node. A policy attribute specified for a VM determines how that VM is scheduled on a node.



# Setting a policy attribute and CPU feature

You can set a policy attribute and CPU feature for each virtual machine (VM) to ensure that it is scheduled on a node according to policy and feature. The CPU feature that you set is verified to ensure that it is supported by the host CPU or emulated by the hypervisor.

* Edit the domain spec of your VM configuration file. The following example sets the CPU feature and the require policy for a virtual machine (VM):

```yaml
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  name: myvm
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      domain:
        cpu:
          features:
            - name: apic 1
              policy: require 2
```

Name of the CPU feature for the VM.
Policy attribute for the VM.

# Scheduling virtual machines with the supported CPU model

You can configure a CPU model for a virtual machine (VM) to schedule it on a node where its CPU model is supported.

* Edit the domain spec of your virtual machine configuration file. The following example shows a specific CPU model defined for a VM:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  name: myvm
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      domain:
        cpu:
          model: Conroe 1
```

CPU model for the VM.

# Scheduling virtual machines with the host model

When the CPU model for a virtual machine (VM) is set to host-model, the VM inherits the CPU model of the node where it is scheduled.

* Edit the domain spec of your VM configuration file. The following example shows host-model being specified for the virtual machine:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubevirt/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  name: myvm
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      domain:
        cpu:
          model: host-model 1
```

The VM that inherits the CPU model of the node where it is scheduled.

# Scheduling virtual machines with a custom scheduler

You can use a custom scheduler to schedule a virtual machine (VM) on a node.

* A secondary scheduler is configured for your cluster.

* Add the custom scheduler to the VM configuration by editing the VirtualMachine manifest. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  name: vm-fedora
spec:
  runStrategy: Always
  template:
    spec:
      schedulerName: my-scheduler 1
      domain:
        devices:
          disks:
            - name: containerdisk
              disk:
                bus: virtio
# ...
```

The name of the custom scheduler. If the schedulerName value does not match an existing scheduler, the virt-launcher pod stays in a Pending state until the specified scheduler is found.

* Verify that the VM is using the custom scheduler specified in the VirtualMachine manifest by checking the virt-launcher pod events:
1. View the list of pods in your cluster by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get pods
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
virt-launcher-vm-fedora-dpc87    2/2     Running   0          24m
```

2. Run the following command to display the pod events:

```terminal
$ oc describe pod virt-launcher-vm-fedora-dpc87
```


The value of the From field in the output verifies that the scheduler name matches the custom scheduler specified in the VirtualMachine manifest:
Example output

```terminal
[...]
Events:
  Type    Reason     Age   From              Message
  ----    ------     ----  ----              -------
  Normal  Scheduled  21m   my-scheduler  Successfully assigned default/virt-launcher-vm-fedora-dpc87 to node01
[...]
```
