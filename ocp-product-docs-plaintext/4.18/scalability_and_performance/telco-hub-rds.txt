# Telco hub reference design specifications


The telco hub reference design specifications (RDS) describes the configuration for a hub cluster that deploys and operates fleets of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters in a telco environment.

[IMPORTANT]
----
The telco hub RDS is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope.

# Hub cluster architecture overview

Use the features and components running on the management hub cluster to manage many other clusters in a hub-and-spoke topology.
The hub cluster provides a highly available and centralized interface for managing the configuration, lifecycle, and observability of the fleet of deployed clusters.


[NOTE]
----
All management hub functionality can be deployed on a dedicated Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster or as applications that are co-resident on an existing cluster.
----

Managed cluster lifecycle:: Using a combination of Day 2 Operators, the hub cluster provides the necessary infrastructure to deploy and configure the fleet of clusters by using a GitOps methodology.
Over the lifetime of the deployed clusters, further management of upgrades, scaling the number of clusters, node replacement, and other lifecycle management functions can be declaratively defined and rolled out.
You can control the timing and progression of the rollout across the fleet.
Monitoring:: 
The hub cluster provides monitoring and status reporting for the managed clusters through the Observability pillar of the {rh-rhacm-full} Operator.
This includes aggregated metrics, alerts, and compliance monitoring through the Governance policy framework.

The telco management hub reference design specifications (RDS) and the associated reference custom resources (CRs) describe the telco engineering and QE validated method for deploying, configuring and managing the lifecycle of telco managed cluster infrastructure.
The reference configuration includes the installation and configuration of the hub cluster components on top of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

# Hub cluster engineering considerations

The follwing sections describe the engineering considerations for hub cluster resource scaling targets and utilization.

## Hub cluster scaling target

The resource requirements for the hub cluster are directly dependent on the number of clusters being managed by the hub, the number of policies used for each managed cluster, and the set of features that are configured in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM).

The hub cluster reference configuration can support up to 3500 managed single-node OpenShift clusters under the following conditions:

* 5 policies for each cluster with hub-side templating configured with a 10 minute evaluation interval.
* Only the following RHACM add-ons are enabled:
* Policy controller
* Observability with the default configuration
* You deploy managed clusters by using GitOps ZTP in batches of up to 500 clusters at a time.

The reference configuration is also validated for deployment and management of a mix of managed cluster topologies.
The specific limits depend on the mix of cluster topologies, enabled RHACM features, and so on.
In a mixed topology scenario, the reference hub configuration is validated with a combination of 1200 single-node OpenShift clusters, 400 compact clusters (3 nodes combined control plane and compute nodes), and 230 standard clusters (3 control plane and 2 worker nodes).


[NOTE]
----
Specific dimensioning requirements are highly dependent on the cluster topology and workload.
For more information, see "Storage requirements".
Adjust cluster dimensions for the specific characteristics of your fleet of managed clusters.
----

## Hubs cluster resource utilization

Resource utilization was measured for hub clusters in the following scenario:

* Under reference load managing 3500 single-node OpenShift clusters.
* 3-node compact cluster for management hub running on dual socket bare-metal servers.
* Network impairment of 50 ms round-trip latency, 100 Mbps bandwidth limit and 0.02% packet loss.



* Comparison of hub cluster and managed cluster templates

## Cluster topology

In production environments, the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform hub cluster must be highly available to maintain high availability of the management functions.

Limits and requirements:: Use a highly available cluster topology for the hub cluster, for example:
* Compact (3 nodes combined control plane and compute nodes)
* Standard (3 control plane nodes + N compute nodes)
Engineering considerations:: 
* In non-production environments, a single-node OpenShift cluster can be used for limited hub cluster functionality.
* Certain capabilities, for example Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation, are not supported on single-node OpenShift.
In this configuration, some hub cluster features might not be available.
* The number of optional compute nodes can vary depending on the scale of the specific use case.
* Compute nodes can be added later as required.

* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform architecture
* Postinstallation node tasks

## Networking

The reference hub cluster is designed to operate in a disconnected networking environment where direct access to the internet is not possible.
As with all Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters, the hub cluster requires access to an image registry hosting all OpenShift and Day 2 Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) images.

The hub cluster supports dual-stack networking support for IPv6 and IPv4 networks.
IPv6 is typical in edge or far-edge network segments, while IPv4 is more prevalent for use with legacy equipment in the data center.

Limits and requirements:: 
* Regardless of the installation method, you must configure the following network types for the hub cluster:
* clusterNetwork
* serviceNetwork
* machineNetwork
* Yout must configure the following IP addresses for the hub cluster:
* apiVIP
* ingressVIP

[NOTE]
----
For the above networking configurations, some values are required, or can be auto-assigned, depending on the chosen architecture and DHCP configuration.
----
* You must use the default Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform network provider OVN-Kubernetes.
* Networking between the managed cluster and hub cluster must meet the networking requirements in the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) documentation, for example:
* Hub cluster access to managed cluster API service, Ironic Python agent, and baseboard management controller (BMC) port.
* Managed cluster access to hub cluster API service, ingress IP and control plane node IP addresses.
* Managed cluster BMC access to hub cluster control plane node IP addresses.
* An image registry must be accessible throughout the lifetime of the hub cluster.
* All required container images must be mirrored to the disconnected registry.
* The hub cluster must be configured to use a disconnected registry.
* The hub cluster cannot host its own image registry.
For example, the registry must be available in a scenario where a power failure affects all cluster nodes.
Engineering considerations:: 
* When deploying a hub cluster, ensure you define appropriately sized CIDR range definitions.

* Installing a cluster in a disconnected environment
* Using Operator Lifecycle Manager on restricted networks
* Configuring the hub cluster to use a disconnected mirror registry
* CIDR range definitions
* Installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
* Networking in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
* Networking in RHACM
* Network configuration in RHACM

## Hub cluster memory and CPU requirements

The memory and CPU requirements of the hub cluster vary depending on the configuration of the hub cluster, the number of resources on the cluster, and the number of managed clusters.

Limits and requirements:: 
* Ensure that the hub cluster meets the underlying memory and CPU requirements for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM).
Engineering considerations:: 
* Before deploying a telco hub cluster, ensure that your cluster host meets cluster requirements.
For more information about scaling the number of managed clusters, see "Hub cluster engineering considerations".

* Scaling your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster and tuning performance in production environments
* Sizing your cluster

## Storage requirements

The total amount of storage required by the management hub cluster is dependant on the storage requirements for each of the applications deployed on the cluster.
The main components that require storage through highly available PersistentVolume resources are described in the following sections.


[NOTE]
----
The storage required for the underlying Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation is separate to these requirements.
----

### Assisted Service

The Assisted Service is deployed with the multicluster engine and Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM).



* Enabling central infrastructure management in disconnected environments

### RHACM Observability

Cluster Observability is provided by the multicluster engine and Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM).

* Observability storage needs several PV resources and an S3 compatible bucket storage for long term retention of the metrics.
* Storage requirements calculation is complex and dependent on the specific workloads and characteristics of managed clusters.
Requirements for PV resources and the S3 bucket depend on many aspects including data retention, the number of managed clusters, managed cluster workloads, and so on.
* Estimate the required storage for observability by using the observability sizing calculator in the RHACM capacity planning repository.
See the Red Hat Knowledgebase article Calculating storage need for MultiClusterHub Observability on telco environments for an explanation of using the calculator to estimate observability storage requirements.
The below table uses inputs derived from the telco RAN DU RDS and the hub cluster RDS as representative values.


[NOTE]
----
The following numbers are estimated.
Tune the values for more accurate results.
Add an engineering margin, for example +20%, to the results to account for potential estimation inaccuracies.
----



With these input values, the sizing calculator as described in the Red Hat Knowledgebase article Calculating storage need for MultiClusterHub Observability on telco environments indicates the following storage needs:





[1] For the object bucket, it is assumed that downsampling is disabled, so that only raw data is calculated for storage requirements.

### Storage considerations

Limits and requirements:: 
* Minimum Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) limits apply
* High availability should be provided through a storage backend.
The hub cluster reference configuration provides storage through Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation.
* Object bucket storage is provided through OpenShift Data Foundation.
Engineering considerations:: 
* Use SSD or NVMe disks with low latency and high throughput for etcd storage.
* The storage solution for telco hub clusters is OpenShift Data Foundation.
* Local Storage Operator supports the storage class used by OpenShift Data Foundation to provide block, file, and object storage as needed by other components on the hub cluster.
* The Local Storage Operator LocalVolume configuration includes setting forceWipeDevicesAndDestroyAllData: true to support the reinstallation of hub cluster nodes where OpenShift Data Foundation has previously been used.

* Persistent storage overview
* OpenShift Data Foundation architecture
* Persistent storage using local volumes
* Recommended etcd practices

## Git repository

The telco management hub cluster supports a GitOps-driven methodology for installing and managing the configuration of OpenShift clusters for various telco applications.
This methodology requires an accessible Git repository that serves as the authoritative source of truth for cluster definitions and configuration artifacts.

Red Hat does not offer a commercially supported Git server.
An existing Git server provided in the production environment can be used.
Gitea and Gogs are examples of self-hosted Git servers that you can use.

The Git repository is typically provided in the production network external to the hub cluster.
In a large-scale deployment, multiple hub clusters can use the same Git repository for maintaining the definitions of managed clusters. Using this approach, you can easily review the state of the complete network.
As the source of truth for cluster definitions, the Git repository should be highly available and recoverable in disaster scenarios.


[NOTE]
----
For disaster recovery and multi-hub considerations, run the Git repository separately from the hub cluster.
----

Limits and requirements:: 
* A Git repository is required to support the GitOps ZTP functions of the hub cluster, including installation, configuration, and lifecycle management of the managed clusters.
* The Git repository must be accessible from the management cluster.
Engineering considerations:: 
* The Git repository is used by the GitOps Operator to ensure continuous deployment and a single source of truth for the applied configuration.

# Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation on the hub cluster

Description:: 
The reference method for installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform for the hub cluster is through the Agent-based Installer.
Agent-based Installer provides installation capabilities without additional centralized infrastructure.
The Agent-based Installer creates an ISO image, which you mount to the server to be installed.
When you boot the server, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is installed alongside optionally supplied extra manifests, such as GitOps ZTP custom resources.

[NOTE]
----
You can also install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform in the hub cluster by using other installation methods.
----
If hub cluster functions are being applied to an existing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, the Agent-based Installer installation is not required.
The remaining steps to install Day 2 Operators and configure the cluster for these functions remains the same.
When Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation is complete, the set of additional Operators and their configuration must be installed on the hub cluster.
The reference configuration includes all of these custom resources (CRs), which you can apply manually, for example:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <reference_cr>
```

You can also add the reference configuration to the Git repository and apply it using ArgoCD.

[NOTE]
----
If applying manually the CRs manually, take care to apply the CRs in the order indicated by the ArgoCD wave annotations.
Any CRs without annotations are in the initial wave.
----
Limits and requirements:: 
* Agent-based Installer requires an accessible image repository containing all required Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and Day 2 Operator images.
* Agent-based Installer builds ISO images based on a specific OpenShift releases and specific cluster details.
Installation of a second hub requires a separate ISO image to be built.
Engineering considerations:: 
* Agent-based Installer provides a baseline Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation.
You apply Day 2 Operators and other configuration CRs after the cluster is installed.
* The reference configuration supports Agent-based Installer installation in a disconnected environment.
* A limited set of additional manifests can be supplied at installation time.
* Any MachineConfiguration CRs you require should be included as extra manifests during installation.

* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation overview
* Installing a cluster with customizations
* Preparing to install with the Agent-based Installer

# Day 2 Operators in the hub cluster

The management hub cluster relies on a set of Day 2 Operators to provide critical management services and infrastructure.
Use Operator versions that match the set of managed cluster versions in your fleet.

Install Day 2 Operators using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) and Subscription custom resources (CRs).
Subscription CRs identify the specific Day 2 Operator to install, the catalog in which the Operator is found, and the appropriate version channel for the Operator.
By default OLM installs and attempt to keep Operators updated with the latest z-stream version available in the channel.
By default all Subscriptions are set with an installPlanApproval: Automatic value.
In this mode, OLM automatically installs new Operator versions when they are available in the catalog and channel.


[NOTE]
----
Setting installPlanApproval to automatic exposes the risk of the Operator being updated outside of defined maintenance windows if the catalog index is updated to include newer Operator versions.
In a disconnected environment where you are building and maintaining a curated set of Operators and versions in the catalog, and if you follow a strategy of creating a new catalog index for updated versions, the risk of the Operators being inadvertently updated is largely removed.
However, if you want to further close this risk, the Subscription CRs can be set to installPlanApproval: Manual which prevents Operators from being updated without explicit administrator approval.
----

Limits and requirements:: 
* When upgrading a telco hub cluster, the versions of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and Operators must meet the requirements of all relevant compatibility matrixes.

# Observability

The Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) multicluster engine Observability component provides centralized aggregation and visualization of metrics and alerts for all managed clusters.
To balance performance and data analysis, the monitoring service maintains a subset list of aggregated metrics that are collected at a downsampled interval.
The metrics can be accessed on the hub through a set of different preconfigured dashboards.

Observability installation:: The primary CR to enable and configure the Observability service is the MulticlusterObservability CR, which defines the following settings:
The primary custom resource (CR) to enable and configure the observability service is the MulticlusterObservability CR, which defines the following settings:
* Configurable retention settings.
* Storage for the different components: thanos receive, thanos compact, thanos rule, thanos store sharding, alertmanager.
* The metadata.annotations.mco-disable-alerting="true" annotation that enables tuning for the monitoring configuration on managed clusters.

[NOTE]
----
Without this setting the Observability component attempts to configure the managed cluster monitoring configuration.
With this value set you can merge your desired configuration with the necessary Observability configuration of alert forwarding into the managed cluster monitoring ConfigMap object.
When the Observability service is enabled RHACM will deploy to each managed cluster a workload to push metrics and alerts generated by local Monitoring to the hub cluster.
The metrics and alerts to be forwarded from the managed cluster to the hub, are defined by a ConfigMap CR in the open-cluster-management-addon-observability namespace.
You can also specify custom metrics, for more information, see Adding custom metrics.
----
Alertmananger configuration:: 
* The hub cluster provides an Observability Alertmanager that can be configured to push alerts to external systems, for example, email.
The Alertmanager is enabled by default.
* You must configure alert forwarding.
* When the Alertmanager is enabled but not configured, the hub Alertmanager does not forward alerts externally.
* When Observability is enabled, the managed clusters can be configured to send alerts to any endpoint including the hub Alertmanager.
* When a managed cluster is configured to forward alerts to external sources, alerts are not routed through the hub cluster Alertmanager.
* Alert state is available as a metric.
* When observability is enabled, the managed cluster alert states are included in the subset of metrics forwarded to the hub cluster and are available through Observability dashboards.
Limits and requirements:: 
* Observability requires persistent object storage for long-term metrics.
For more information, see "Storage requirements".
Engineering considerations:: 
* Forwarding of metrics is a subset of the full metric data.
It includes only the metrics defined in the observability-metrics-allowlist config map and any custom metrics added by the user.
* Metrics are forwarded at a downsampled rate.
Metrics are forwarded by taking the latest datapoint at a 5 minute interval (or as defined by the MultiClusterObservability CR configuration).
* A network outage may lead to a loss of metrics forwarded to the hub cluster during that interval.
This can be mitigated if metrics are also forwarded directly from managed clusters to an external metrics collector in the providers network.
Full resolution metrics are available on the managed cluster.
* In addition to default metrics dashboards on the hub, users may define custom dashboards.
* The reference configuration is sized based on 15 days of metrics storage by the hub cluster for 3500 single-node OpenShift clusters.
If longer retention or other managed cluster topology or sizing is required, the storage calculations must be updated and sufficient storage capacity be maintained.
For more information about calculating new values, see "Storage requirements".

# Managed cluster lifecycle management

To provision and manage sites at the far edge of the network, use GitOps ZTP in a hub-and-spoke architecture, where a single hub cluster manages many managed clusters.

Lifecycle management for spoke clusters can be divided into two different stages: cluster deployment, including Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation, and cluster configuration.

* Challenges of the network far edge

## Managed cluster deployment

Description:: As of Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) 2.12, using the SiteConfig Operator is the recommended method for deploying managed clusters.
The SiteConfig Operator introduces a unified ClusterInstance API that decouples the parameters that define the cluster from the manner in which it is deployed.
The SiteConfig Operator uses a set of cluster templates that are instantiated using the data from a ClusterInstance custom resource (CR) to dynamically generate installation manifests.
Following the GitOps methodology, the ClusterInstance CR is sourced from a Git repository through ArgoCD.
The ClusterInstance CR can be used to initiate cluster installation by using either Assisted Installer, or the image-based installation available in multicluster engine.
Limits and requirements:: 
* The SiteConfig ArgoCD plugin which handles SiteConfig CRs is deprecated from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18.
Engineering considerations:: 
* You must create a Secret CR with the login information for the cluster baseboard management controller (BMC).
This Secret CR is then referenced in the SiteConfig CR.
Integration with a secret store, such as Vault, can be used to manage the secrets.
* Besides offering deployment method isolation and unification of Git and non-Git workflows, the SiteConfig Operator provides better scalability, greater flexibility with the use of custom templates, and an enhanced troubleshooting experience.

* SiteConfig
* ClusterInstance
* Creating the managed bare-metal host secrets

## Managed cluster updates

Description:: 
You can upgrade versions of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, Day 2 Operators, and managed cluster configurations, by declaring the required version in the Policy custom resources (CRs) that target the clusters to be upgraded.
Policy controllers periodically check for policy compliance.
If the result is negative, a violation report is created.
If the policy remediation action is set to enforce the violations are remediated according to the updated policy.
If the policy remediation action is set to inform, the process ends with a non-compliant status report and responsibility to initiate the upgrade is left to the user to perform during an appropriate maintenance window.
The Topology Aware Lifecycle Manager (TALM) extends Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) with features to manage the rollout of upgrades or configuration throughout the lifecycle of the fleet of clusters.
It operates in progressive, limited size batches of clusters.
When upgrades to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform or the Day 2 Operators are required, TALM progressively rolls out the updates by stepping through the set of policies and switching them to an "enforce" policy to push the configuration to the managed cluster.
The custom resource (CR) that TALM uses to build the remediation plan is the ClusterGroupUpgrade CR.
You can use image-based upgrade (IBU) with the Lifecycle Agent as an alternative upgrade path for the single-node OpenShift cluster platform version.
IBU uses an OCI image generated from a dedicated seed cluster to install single-node OpenShift on the target cluster.
TALM uses the ImageBasedGroupUpgrade CR to roll out image-based upgrades to a set of identified clusters.
Limits and requirements:: 
* You can perform direct upgrades for single-node OpenShift clusters using image-based upgrade for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform <4.y> to <4.y+2>, and <4.y.z> to <4.y.z+n>.
* Image-based upgrade uses custom images that are specific to the hardware platform that the clusters are running on.
Different hardware platforms require separate seed images.
Engineering considerations:: 
* In edge deployments, you can minimize the disruption to managed clusters by managing the timing and rollout of changes.
Set all policies to inform to monitor compliance without triggering automatic enforcement.
Similarly, configure Day 2 Operator subscriptions to manual to prevent updates from occurring outside of scheduled maintenance windows.
* The recommended upgrade aproach for single-node OpenShift clusters is the image-based upgrade.
* For multi-node cluster upgrades, consider the following MachineConfigPool CR configurations to reduce upgrade times:
* Pause configuration deployments to nodes during a maintenance window by setting the paused field to true.
* Adjust the maxUnavailable field to control how many nodes in the pool can be updated simultaneously.
The MaxUnavailable field defines the percentage of nodes in the pool that can be simultaneously unavailable during a MachineConfig object update.
Set maxUnavailable to the maximum tolerable value.
This reduces the number of reboots in a cluster during upgrades which results in shorter upgrade times.
* Resume configuration deployments by setting the paused field to false. The configuration changes are applied in a single reboot.
* During cluster installation, you can pause MachineConfigPool CRs by setting the paused field to true and setting maxUnavailable to 100% to improve installation times.

# Hub cluster disaster recovery

Note that loss of the hub cluster does not typically create a service outage on the managed clusters.
Functions provided by the hub cluster will be lost, such as observability, configuration, lifecycle management updates being driven through the hub cluster, and so on.

Limits and requirements:: 
* Backup,restore and disaster recovery are offered by the cluster backup and restore Operator, which depends on the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Operator.
Engineering considerations:: 
* You can extend the cluster backup and restore operator to third party resources of the hub cluster based on your configuration.
* The cluster backup and restore operator is not enabled by default in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM).
The reference configuration enables this feature.

* Business continuity

# Hub cluster components

## Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM)

New in this release:: 
* No reference design updates in this release.
Description:: 
Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) provides multicluster engine installation and ongoing lifecycle management functionality for deployed clusters.
You can manage cluster configuration and upgrades declaratively by applying Policy custom resources (CRs) to clusters during maintenance windows.
RHACM provides functionality such as the following:
* Zero touch provisioning (ZTP) and ongoing scaling of clusters using the multicluster engine component in RHACM.
* Configuration, upgrades, and cluster status through the RHACM policy controller.
* During managed cluster installation, RHACM can apply labels to individual nodes as configured through the ClusterInstance CR.
* The Topology Aware Lifecycle Manager component of RHACM provides phased rollout of configuration changes to managed clusters.
* The RHACM multicluster engine Observability component provides selective monitoring, dashboards, alerts, and metrics.
The recommended method for single-node OpenShift cluster installation is the image-based installation method in multicluster engine, which uses the ClusterInstance CR for cluster definition.
The recommended method for single-node OpenShift upgrade is the image-based upgrade method.

[NOTE]
----
The RHACM multicluster engine Observability component brings you a centralized view of the health and status of all the managed clusters.
By default, every managed cluster is enabled to send metrics and alerts, created by their Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO), back to Observability.
For more information, see "Observability".
----
Limits and requirements:: 
* For more information about limits on number of clusters managed by a single hub cluster, see "Telco management hub cluster use model".
* The number of managed clusters that can be effectively managed by the hub depends on various factors, including:
* Resource availability at each managed cluster
* Policy complexity and cluster size
* Network utilization
* Workload demands and distribution
* The hub and managed clusters must maintain sufficient bi-directional connectivity.
Engineering considerations:: 
* You can configure the cluster backup and restore Operator to include third-party resources.
* The use of RHACM hub side templating when defining configuration through policy is strongly recommended.
This feature reduces the number of policies needed to manage the fleet by enabling for each cluster or for each group. For example, regional or hardware type content to be templated in a policy and substituted on cluster or group basis.
* Managed clusters typically have some number of configuration values which are specific to an individual cluster.
These should be managed using RHACM policy hub side templating with values pulled from ConfigMap CRs based on the cluster name.

* Multi Cluster Engine
* Governance
* Topology Aware Lifecycle Manager
* MultiClusterHub Observability
* Business continuity
* Performance and scalability
* Network configuration

## Topology Aware Lifecycle Manager

New in this release:: 
* No reference design updates in this release.
Description:: 
TALM is an Operator that runs only on the hub cluster for managing how changes like cluster upgrades, Operator upgrades, and cluster configuration are rolled out to the network. TALM supports the following features:
* Progressive rollout of policy updates to fleets of clusters in user configurable batches.
* Per-cluster actions add ztp-done labels or other user-configurable labels following configuration changes to managed clusters.
* TALM supports optional pre-caching of {product_title}, OLM Operator, and additional images to single-node OpenShift clusters before initiating an upgrade. The pre-caching feature is not applicable when using the recommended image-based upgrade method for upgrading single-node OpenShift clusters.
* Specifying optional pre-caching configurations with PreCachingConfig CRs.
* Configurable image filtering to exclude unused content.
* Storage validation before and after pre-caching, using defined space requirement parameters.
Limits and requirements:: 
* TALM supports concurrent cluster upgrades in batches of 500.
* Pre-caching is limited to single-node OpenShift cluster topology.
Engineering considerations:: 
* The PreCachingConfig custom resource (CR) is optional. You do not need to create it if you want to pre-cache platform-related images only, such as Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and OLM.
* TALM supports the use of hub-side templating with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management policies.

## GitOps Operator and GitOps ZTP

New in this release:: 
* No reference design updates in this release
Description:: GitOps Operator and GitOps ZTP provide a GitOps-based infrastructure for managing cluster deployment and configuration.
Cluster definitions and configurations are maintained as a declarative state in Git.
You can apply ClusterInstance custom resources (CRs) to the hub cluster where the SiteConfig Operator renders them as installation CRs.
In earlier releases, a GitOps ZTP plugin supported the generation of installation CRs from SiteConfig CRs.
This plugin is now deprecated.
A separate GitOps ZTP plugin is available to enable automatic wrapping of configuration CRs into policies based on the PolicyGenerator or the PolicyGenTemplate CRs.

You can deploy and manage multiple versions of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on managed clusters by using the baseline reference configuration CRs.
You can use custom CRs alongside the baseline CRs.
To maintain multiple per-version policies simultaneously, use Git to manage the versions of the source and policy CRs by using the PolicyGenerator or the PolicyGenTemplate CRs.
Limits and requirements:: 
* 300 single node SiteConfig CRs can be synchronized for each ArgoCD application.
You can use multiple applications to achieve the maximum number of clusters supported by a single hub cluster.
* To ensure consistent and complete cleanup of managed clusters and their associated resources during cluster or node deletion, you must configure ArgoCD to use background deletion mode.
Engineering considerations:: 
* To avoid confusion or unintentional overwrite when updating content, use unique and distinguishable names for custom CRs in the source-crs directory and extra manifests.
* Keep reference source CRs in a separate directory from custom CRs.
This facilitates easy update of reference CRs as required.
* To help with multiple versions, keep all source CRs and policy creation CRs in versioned Git repositories to ensure consistent generation of policies for each Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform version.

* ClusterInstance CR
* PolicyGenTemplate CRs
* GitOps ZTP version independence

## Local Storage Operator

New in this release:: 
* No reference design updates in this release
Description:: You can create persistent volumes that can be used as PVC resources by applications with the Local Storage Operator.
The number and type of PV resources that you create depends on your requirements.
Engineering considerations:: 
* Create backing storage for PV CRs before creating the persistent volume.
This can be a partition, a local volume, LVM volume, or full disk.
* Refer to the device listing in LocalVolume CRs by the hardware path used to access each device to ensure correct allocation of disks and partitions, for example, /dev/disk/by-path/<id>.
Logical names (for example, /dev/sda) are not guaranteed to be consistent across node reboots.

## Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation

New in this release:: 
* No reference design updates in this release
Description:: Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation provides file, block, and object storage services to the hub cluster.
Limits and requirements:: 
* Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF) in internal mode requires the Local Storage Operator to define a storage class which will provide the necessary underlying storage.
* When doing the planning for a telco management cluster, consider the ODF infrastructure and networking requirements.
* Dual stack support is limited.
ODF IPv4 is supported on dual-stack clusters.
Engineering considerations:: 
* Address capacity warnings promptly as recovery can be difficult in case of storage capacity exhaustion, see Capacity planning.

* Support OpenShift dual stack with OpenShift Data Foundation using IPv4
* Infrastructure requirements
* Network requirements
* Storage cluster deployment approaches

## Logging

New in this release:: 
* No reference design updates in this release
Description:: Use the Cluster Logging Operator to collect and ship logs off the node for remote archival and analysis.
The reference configuration uses Kafka to ship audit and infrastructure logs to a remote archive.
Limits and requirements:: 
* The reference configuration does not include local log storage.
* The reference configuration does not include aggregation of managed cluster logs at the hub cluster.
Engineering considerations:: 
* The impact of cluster CPU use is based on the number or size of logs generated and the amount of log filtering configured.
* The reference configuration does not include shipping of application logs.
The inclusion of application logs in the configuration requires you to evaluate the application logging rate and have sufficient additional CPU resources allocated to the reserved set.

## OpenShift API for Data Protection

New in this release:: 
* No reference design updates in this release
Description:: 
The OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Operator is automatically installed and managed by Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) when the backup feature is enabled.
The OADP Operator facilitates the backup and restore of workloads in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters.
Based on the upstream open source project Velero, it allows you to backup and restore all Kubernetes resources for a given project, including persistent volumes.
While it is not mandatory to have it on the hub cluster, it is highly recommended for cluster backup, disaster recovery and high availability architecture for the hub cluster.
The OADP Operator must be enabled to use the disaster recovery solutions for RHACM.
The reference configuration enables backup (OADP) through the MultiClusterHub custom resource (CR) provided by the RHACM Operator.
Limits and requirements:: 
* Only one version of OADP can be installed on a cluster.
The version installed by RHACM must be used for RHACM disaster recovery features.
Engineering considerations:: 
* No engineering consideration updates in this release.
