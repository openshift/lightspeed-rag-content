# Backup and Restore CR issues

You might encounter the following common issues with Backup and Restore custom resources (CRs):

# Backup CR cannot retrieve volume

The Backup CR displays the following error message: InvalidVolume.NotFound: The volume ‘vol-xxxx’ does not exist.

The persistent volume (PV) and the snapshot locations are in different regions.

1. Edit the value of the spec.snapshotLocations.velero.config.region key in the DataProtectionApplication manifest so that the snapshot location is in the same region as the PV.
2. Create a new Backup CR.

# Backup CR status remains in progress

The status of a Backup CR remains in the InProgress phase and does not complete.

If a backup is interrupted, it cannot be resumed.

1. Retrieve the details of the Backup CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc -n {namespace} exec deployment/velero -c velero -- ./velero \
  backup describe <backup>
```

2. Delete the Backup CR by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete backups.velero.io <backup> -n openshift-adp
```


You do not need to clean up the backup location because an in progress Backup CR has not uploaded files to object storage.
3. Create a new Backup CR.
4. View the Velero backup details by running the following command:

```terminal
$ velero backup describe <backup-name> --details
```


# Backup CR status remains in PartiallyFailed

The status of a Backup CR without Restic in use remains in the PartiallyFailed phase and is not completed. A snapshot of the affiliated PVC is not created.

If the backup created based on the CSI snapshot class is missing a label, the CSI snapshot plugin fails to create a snapshot. As a result, the Velero pod logs an error similar to the following message:


```text
time="2023-02-17T16:33:13Z" level=error msg="Error backing up item" backup=openshift-adp/user1-backup-check5 error="error executing custom action (groupResource=persistentvolumeclaims, namespace=busy1, name=pvc1-user1): rpc error: code = Unknown desc = failed to get volumesnapshotclass for storageclass ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd: failed to get volumesnapshotclass for provisioner openshift-storage.rbd.csi.ceph.com, ensure that the desired volumesnapshot class has the velero.io/csi-volumesnapshot-class label" logSource="/remote-source/velero/app/pkg/backup/backup.go:417" name=busybox-79799557b5-vprq
```


1. Delete the Backup CR by running the following command::

```terminal
$ oc delete backups.velero.io <backup> -n openshift-adp
```

2. If required, clean up the stored data on the BackupStorageLocation to free up space.
3. Apply the label velero.io/csi-volumesnapshot-class=true to the VolumeSnapshotClass object by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc label volumesnapshotclass/<snapclass_name> velero.io/csi-volumesnapshot-class=true
```

4. Create a new Backup CR.
