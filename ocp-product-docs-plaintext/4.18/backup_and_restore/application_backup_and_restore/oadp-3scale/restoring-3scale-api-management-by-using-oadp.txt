# Restoring 3scale API Management by using OADP


You can restore Red Hat 3scale API Management components by restoring the backed up 3scale operator resources. You can also restore databases such as MySQL and Redis.
After the data has been restored, you can scale up the 3scale operator and deployment.
* You installed and configured Red Hat 3scale API Management. For more information, see Installing 3scale API Management on OpenShift and Red Hat 3scale API Management.
* You backed up the 3scale operator, and databases such as MySQL and Redis.
* Ensure that you are restoring 3scale on the same cluster where it was backed up from.
* If you want to restore 3scale on a different cluster, ensure that the original backed-up cluster and the cluster you want to restore the operator on are using the same custom domain.

# Restoring the 3scale API Management operator, secrets, and APIManager

You can restore the Red&#160;Hat 3scale API Management operator resources, and both the Secret and APIManager custom resources (CRs) by using the following procedure.

* You backed up the 3scale operator.
* You backed up the MySQL and Redis databases.
* You are restoring the database on the same cluster, where it was backed up.

If you are restoring the operator to a different cluster that you backed up from, install and configure OADP with nodeAgent enabled on the destination cluster. Ensure that the OADP configuration is same as it was on the source cluster.

1. Delete the 3scale operator custom resource definitions (CRDs) along with the threescale namespace by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete project threescale
```

Example output

```terminal
"threescale" project deleted successfully
```

2. Create a YAML file with the following configuration to restore the 3scale operator:
Example restore.yaml file

```yaml
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: operator-installation-restore
  namespace: openshift-adp
spec:
  backupName: operator-install-backup 1
  excludedResources:
  - nodes
  - events
  - events.events.k8s.io
  - backups.velero.io
  - restores.velero.io

  - csinodes.storage.k8s.io
  - volumeattachments.storage.k8s.io
  - backuprepositories.velero.io
  itemOperationTimeout: 4h0m0s
```

Restoring the 3scale operator's backup
3. Restore the 3scale operator by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f restore.yaml
```

Example output

```terminal
restore.velerio.io/operator-installation-restore created
```

4. Manually create the s3-credentials Secret object by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f - <<EOF
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
      name: s3-credentials
      namespace: threescale
stringData:
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: <ID_123456> 1
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: <ID_98765544> 2
  AWS_BUCKET: <mybucket.example.com> 3
  AWS_REGION: <us-east-1> 4
type: Opaque
EOF
```

Replace <ID_123456> with your AWS credentials ID.
Replace <ID_98765544> with your AWS credentials KEY.
Replace <mybucket.example.com> with your target bucket name.
Replace <us-east-1> with the AWS region of your bucket.
5. Scale down the 3scale operator by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc scale deployment threescale-operator-controller-manager-v2 --replicas=0 -n threescale
```

Example output

```terminal
deployment.apps/threescale-operator-controller-manager-v2 scaled

# Scaling up the 3scale API Management operator and deployment

You can scale up the Red&#160;Hat 3scale API Management operator and any deployment that was manually scaled down. After a few minutes, 3scale installation should be fully functional, and its state should match the backed-up state.

* You restored the 3scale operator resources, and both the Secret and APIManager custom resources (CRs).
* You restored the MySQL and back-end Redis databases.
* Ensure that there are no scaled up deployments or no extra pods running.
There might be some system-mysql or backend-redis pods running detached from deployments after restoration, which can be removed after the restoration is successful.

1. Scale up the 3scale operator by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc scale deployment threescale-operator-controller-manager-v2 --replicas=1 -n threescale
```

Example output

```terminal
deployment.apps/threescale-operator-controller-manager-v2 scaled
```

2. Ensure that the 3scale pod is running to verify if the 3scale operator was deployed by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get pods -n threescale
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME									                    READY        STATUS	  RESTARTS	 AGE
threescale-operator-controller-manager-v2-79546bd8c-b4qbh	1/1	         Running  0          2m5s
```

3. Create the following script to scale up the deployments:

```terminal
$ vi ./scaledeployment.sh
```

Example script file:

```terminal
for deployment in apicast-production apicast-staging backend-cron backend-listener backend-redis backend-worker system-app system-memcache system-mysql system-redis system-searchd system-sidekiq zync zync-database zync-que; do
    oc scale deployment/$deployment --replicas=1 -n threescale
done
```

4. Scale up the deployments by running the following script:

```terminal
$ ./scaledeployment.sh
```

Example output:

```terminal
deployment.apps.openshift.io/apicast-production scaled
deployment.apps.openshift.io/apicast-staging scaled
deployment.apps.openshift.io/backend-cron scaled
deployment.apps.openshift.io/backend-listener scaled
deployment.apps.openshift.io/backend-redis scaled
deployment.apps.openshift.io/backend-worker scaled
deployment.apps.openshift.io/system-app scaled
deployment.apps.openshift.io/system-memcache scaled
deployment.apps.openshift.io/system-mysql scaled
deployment.apps.openshift.io/system-redis scaled
deployment.apps.openshift.io/system-searchd scaled
deployment.apps.openshift.io/system-sidekiq scaled
deployment.apps.openshift.io/zync scaled
deployment.apps.openshift.io/zync-database scaled
deployment.apps.openshift.io/zync-que scaled
```

5. Get the 3scale-admin route to log in to the 3scale UI by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get routes -n threescale
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME                         HOST/PORT                                                                   PATH   SERVICES             PORT      TERMINATION     WILDCARD
backend                      backend-3scale.apps.custom-cluster-name.openshift.com                         backend-listener     http      edge/Allow      None
zync-3scale-api-b4l4d        api-3scale-apicast-production.apps.custom-cluster-name.openshift.com          apicast-production   gateway   edge/Redirect   None
zync-3scale-api-b6sns        api-3scale-apicast-staging.apps.custom-cluster-name.openshift.com             apicast-staging      gateway   edge/Redirect   None
zync-3scale-master-7sc4j     master.apps.custom-cluster-name.openshift.com                                 system-master        http      edge/Redirect   None
zync-3scale-provider-7r2nm   3scale-admin.apps.custom-cluster-name.openshift.com                           system-provider      http      edge/Redirect   None
zync-3scale-provider-mjxlb   3scale.apps.custom-cluster-name.openshift.com                                 system-developer     http      edge/Redirect   None
```


In this example, 3scale-admin.apps.custom-cluster-name.openshift.com is the 3scale-admin URL.
6. Use the URL from this output to log in to the 3scale operator as an administrator. You can verify that the data, when you took backup, is available.
