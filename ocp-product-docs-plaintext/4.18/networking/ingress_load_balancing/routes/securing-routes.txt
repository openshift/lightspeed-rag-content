# Securing routes


You can secure a route with HTTP strict transport security (HSTS).

# HTTP Strict Transport Security

HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) policy is a security enhancement, which signals to the browser client that only HTTPS traffic is allowed on the route host. HSTS also optimizes web traffic by signaling HTTPS transport is required, without using HTTP redirects. HSTS is useful for speeding up interactions with websites.

When HSTS policy is enforced, HSTS adds a Strict Transport Security header to HTTP and HTTPS responses from the site. You can use the insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy value in a route to redirect HTTP to HTTPS. When HSTS is enforced, the client changes all requests from the HTTP URL to HTTPS before the request is sent, eliminating the need for a redirect.

Cluster administrators can configure HSTS to do the following:

* Enable HSTS per-route
* Disable HSTS per-route
* Enforce HSTS per-domain, for a set of domains, or use namespace labels in combination with domains


[IMPORTANT]
----
HSTS works only with secure routes, either edge-terminated or re-encrypt. The configuration is ineffective on HTTP or passthrough routes.
----

## Enabling HTTP Strict Transport Security per-route

HTTP strict transport security (HSTS) is implemented in the HAProxy template and applied to edge and re-encrypt routes that have the haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header annotation.

* You are logged in to the cluster with a user with administrator privileges for the project.
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* To enable HSTS on a route, add the haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header value to the edge-terminated or re-encrypt route. You can use the oc annotate tool to do this by running the following command. To properly run the command, ensure that the semicolon (;) in the haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header route annotation is also surrounded by double quotation marks ("").
Example annotate command that sets the maximum age to 31536000 ms (approximetly 8.5 hours)

```terminal
$ oc annotate route <route_name> -n <namespace> --overwrite=true "haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header=max-age=31536000;\
includeSubDomains;preload"
```

Example route configured with an annotation

```yaml
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  annotations:
    haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header: max-age=31536000;includeSubDomains;preload 1 2 3
# ...
spec:
  host: def.abc.com
  tls:
    termination: "reencrypt"
    ...
  wildcardPolicy: "Subdomain"
# ...
```

Required. max-age measures the length of time, in seconds, that the HSTS policy is in effect. If set to 0, it negates the policy.
Optional. When included, includeSubDomains tells the client
that all subdomains of the host must have the same HSTS policy as the host.
Optional. When max-age is greater than 0, you can add preload in  haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header to allow external services to include this site in their HSTS preload lists. For example, sites such as Google can construct a list of sites that have preload set. Browsers can then use these lists to determine which sites they can communicate with over HTTPS, even before they have interacted with the site. Without preload set, browsers must have interacted with the site over HTTPS, at least once, to get the header.

## Disabling HTTP Strict Transport Security per-route

To disable HTTP strict transport security (HSTS) per-route, you can set the max-age value in the route annotation to 0.

* You are logged in to the cluster with a user with administrator privileges for the project.
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* To disable HSTS, set the max-age value in the route annotation to 0, by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc annotate route <route_name> -n <namespace> --overwrite=true "haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header"="max-age=0"
```


[TIP]
----
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to create the config map:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header: max-age=0
```

----
* To disable HSTS for every route in a namespace, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc annotate route --all -n <namespace> --overwrite=true "haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header"="max-age=0"
```


1. To query the annotation for all routes, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get route  --all-namespaces -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if .metadata.annotations}}{{$a := index .metadata.annotations "haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header"}}{{$n := .metadata.name}}{{with $a}}Name: {{$n}} HSTS: {{$a}}{{"\n"}}{{else}}{{""}}{{end}}{{end}}{{end}}'
```

Example output

```terminal
Name: routename HSTS: max-age=0
```


## Enforcing HTTP Strict Transport Security per-domain

To enforce HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) per-domain for secure routes, add a requiredHSTSPolicies record to the Ingress spec to capture the configuration of the HSTS policy.

If you configure a requiredHSTSPolicy to enforce HSTS, then any newly created route must be configured with a compliant HSTS policy annotation.


[NOTE]
----
To handle upgraded clusters with non-compliant HSTS routes, you can update the manifests at the source and apply the updates.
----


[NOTE]
----
You cannot use oc expose route or oc create route commands to add a route in a domain that enforces HSTS, because the API for these commands does not accept annotations.
----


[IMPORTANT]
----
HSTS cannot be applied to insecure, or non-TLS routes, even if HSTS is requested for all routes globally.
----

* You are logged in to the cluster with a user with administrator privileges for the project.
* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

1. Edit the Ingress configuration YAML by running the following command and updating fields as needed:

```terminal
$ oc edit ingresses.config.openshift.io/cluster
```

Example HSTS policy

```yaml
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  domain: 'hello-openshift-default.apps.username.devcluster.openshift.com'
  requiredHSTSPolicies: 1
  - domainPatterns: 2
    - '*hello-openshift-default.apps.username.devcluster.openshift.com'
    - '*hello-openshift-default2.apps.username.devcluster.openshift.com'
    namespaceSelector: 3
      matchLabels:
        myPolicy: strict
    maxAge: 4
      smallestMaxAge: 1
      largestMaxAge: 31536000
    preloadPolicy: RequirePreload 5
    includeSubDomainsPolicy: RequireIncludeSubDomains 6
  - domainPatterns:
    - 'abc.example.com'
    - '*xyz.example.com'
    namespaceSelector:
      matchLabels: {}
    maxAge: {}
    preloadPolicy: NoOpinion
    includeSubDomainsPolicy: RequireNoIncludeSubDomains
```

Required. requiredHSTSPolicies are validated in order, and the first matching domainPatterns applies.
Required. You must specify at least one domainPatterns hostname. Any number of domains can be listed. You can include multiple sections of enforcing options for different domainPatterns.
Optional. If you include namespaceSelector, it must match the labels of the project where the routes reside, to enforce the set HSTS policy on the routes. Routes that only match the namespaceSelector and not the domainPatterns are not validated.
Required. max-age measures the length of time, in seconds, that the HSTS policy is in effect. This policy setting allows for a smallest and largest max-age to be enforced.
* The largestMaxAge value must be between 0 and 2147483647. It can be left unspecified, which means no upper limit is enforced.
* The smallestMaxAge value must be between 0 and 2147483647. Enter 0 to disable HSTS for troubleshooting, otherwise enter 1 if you never want HSTS to be disabled. It can be left unspecified, which means no lower limit is enforced.
Optional. Including preload in haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header allows external services to include this site in their HSTS preload lists. Browsers can then use these lists to determine which sites they can communicate with over HTTPS, before they have interacted with the site. Without preload set, browsers need to interact at least once with the site to get the header. preload can be set with one of the following:
* RequirePreload: preload is required by the RequiredHSTSPolicy.
* RequireNoPreload: preload is forbidden by the RequiredHSTSPolicy.
* NoOpinion: preload does not matter to the RequiredHSTSPolicy.
Optional. includeSubDomainsPolicy can be set with one of the following:
* RequireIncludeSubDomains: includeSubDomains is required by the RequiredHSTSPolicy.
* RequireNoIncludeSubDomains: includeSubDomains is forbidden by the RequiredHSTSPolicy.
* NoOpinion: includeSubDomains does not matter to the RequiredHSTSPolicy.
2. You can apply HSTS to all routes in the cluster or in a particular namespace by entering the oc annotate command.
* To apply HSTS to all routes in the cluster, enter the oc annotate command. For example:

```terminal
$ oc annotate route --all --all-namespaces --overwrite=true "haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header"="max-age=31536000"
```

* To apply HSTS to all routes in a particular namespace, enter the oc annotate command. For example:

```terminal
$ oc annotate route --all -n my-namespace --overwrite=true "haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header"="max-age=31536000"
```


You can review the HSTS policy you configured. For example:

* To review the maxAge set for required HSTS policies, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get clusteroperator/ingress -n openshift-ingress-operator -o jsonpath='{range .spec.requiredHSTSPolicies[*]}{.spec.requiredHSTSPolicies.maxAgePolicy.largestMaxAge}{"\n"}{end}'
```

* To review the HSTS annotations on all routes, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get route  --all-namespaces -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if .metadata.annotations}}{{$a := index .metadata.annotations "haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header"}}{{$n := .metadata.name}}{{with $a}}Name: {{$n}} HSTS: {{$a}}{{"\n"}}{{else}}{{""}}{{end}}{{end}}{{end}}'
```

Example output

```terminal
Name: <_routename_> HSTS: max-age=31536000;preload;includeSubDomains
```
