As a cluster administrator you can remove an additional network attachment.

# Removing a secondary network attachment definition

As a cluster administrator, you can remove a secondary network from your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. The secondary network is not removed from any pods it is attached to.

* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* Log in as a user with cluster-admin privileges.

To remove a secondary network from your cluster, complete the following steps:

1. Edit the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) in your default text editor by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc edit networks.operator.openshift.io cluster
```

2. Modify the CR by removing the configuration that the CNO created from the additionalNetworks collection for the secondary network that you want to remove.

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  additionalNetworks: [] 1
```

If you are removing the configuration mapping for the only secondary network attachment definition in the additionalNetworks collection, you must specify an empty collection.
3. To remove a network attachment definition from the network of your cluster, enter the following command:

```terminal
$ oc delete net-attach-def <name_of_NAD> 1
```

Replace <name_of_NAD> with the name of your network attachment definition.
4. Save your changes and quit the text editor to commit your changes.
5. Optional: Confirm that the secondary network CR was deleted by running the following command:

```terminal
$ oc get network-attachment-definition --all-namespaces
```
