# Configuring a custom PKI


To ensure secure communication between internal components in your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, you can add your organization's custom Certificate Authority (CA) certificates to the cluster-wide truststore.
You can leverage the Proxy API to add cluster-wide trusted CA certificates. You
must do this either during installation or at runtime.
* During installation, configure the cluster-wide proxy. You must define your
privately signed CA certificates in the install-config.yaml file's
additionalTrustBundle setting.

The installation program generates a ConfigMap that is named user-ca-bundle
that contains the additional CA certificates you defined. The Cluster Network
Operator then creates a trusted-ca-bundle ConfigMap that merges these CA
certificates with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) trust bundle; this ConfigMap is
referenced in the Proxy object's trustedCA field.
* At runtime, modify the default Proxy object to include your privately signed CA certificates (part of cluster's proxy enablement workflow). This involves
creating a ConfigMap that contains the privately signed CA certificates that
should be trusted by the cluster, and then modifying the proxy resource with the
trustedCA referencing the privately signed certificates' ConfigMap.

[NOTE]
----
The installer configuration's additionalTrustBundle field and the proxy
resource's trustedCA field are used to manage the cluster-wide trust bundle;
additionalTrustBundle is used at install time and the proxy's trustedCA is
used at runtime.
The trustedCA field is a reference to a ConfigMap containing the custom
certificate and key pair used by the cluster component.

# Configuring the cluster-wide proxy during installation

To enable internet access in environments that deny direct connections, configure a cluster-wide proxy in the install-config.yaml file. This configuration ensures that the new Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster routes traffic through the specified HTTP or HTTPS proxy.

* You have an existing install-config.yaml file.
* You have reviewed the sites that your cluster requires access to and determined whether any of them need to bypass the proxy. By default, all cluster egress traffic is proxied, including calls to hosting cloud provider APIs. You added sites to the Proxy object's spec.noProxy field to bypass the proxy if necessary.

[NOTE]
----
The Proxy object status.noProxy field is populated with the values of the networking.machineNetwork[].cidr, networking.clusterNetwork[].cidr, and networking.serviceNetwork[] fields from your installation configuration.
For installations on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, and Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP), the Proxy object status.noProxy field is also populated with the instance metadata endpoint (169.254.169.254).
----

1. Edit your install-config.yaml file and add the proxy settings. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: my.domain.com
proxy:
  httpProxy: http://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port>
  httpsProxy: https://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port>
  noProxy: example.com
additionalTrustBundle: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    <MY_TRUSTED_CA_CERT>
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
additionalTrustBundlePolicy: <policy_to_add_additionalTrustBundle>
# ...
```


where:
proxy.httpProxy:: Specifies a proxy URL to use for creating HTTP connections outside the cluster. The URL scheme must be http.
proxy.httpsProxy:: Specifies a proxy URL to use for creating HTTPS connections outside the cluster.
proxy.noProxy:: Specifies a comma-separated list of destination domain names, IP addresses, or other network CIDRs to exclude from proxying. Preface a domain with . to match subdomains only. For example, .y.com matches x.y.com, but not y.com. Use * to bypass the proxy for all destinations.
additionalTrustBundle:: If provided, the installation program generates a config map that is named user-ca-bundle inthe openshift-config namespace to hold the additional CA certificates. If you provide additionalTrustBundle and at least one proxy setting, the Proxy object is configured to reference the user-ca-bundle config map in the trustedCA field. The Cluster Network Operator then creates a trusted-ca-bundle config map that merges the contents specified for the trustedCA parameter with the RHCOS trust bundle. The additionalTrustBundle field is required unless the proxy's identity certificate is signed by an authority from the RHCOS trust bundle.
additionalTrustBundlePolicy:: Specifies the policy that determines the configuration of the Proxy object to reference the user-ca-bundle config map in the trustedCA field. The allowed values are Proxyonly and Always. Use Proxyonly to reference the user-ca-bundle config map only when http/https proxy is configured. Use Always to always reference the user-ca-bundle config map. The default value is Proxyonly. Optional parameter.

[NOTE]
----
The installation program does not support the proxy readinessEndpoints field.
----

[NOTE]
----
If the installer times out, restart and then complete the deployment by using the wait-for command of the installer. For example:
+

```terminal
$ ./openshift-install wait-for install-complete --log-level debug
```

----
2. Save the file and reference it when installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

The installation program creates a cluster-wide proxy that is named cluster that uses the proxy settings in the provided install-config.yaml file. If no proxy settings are provided, a cluster Proxy object is still created, but it will have a nil spec.

[NOTE]
----
Only the Proxy object named cluster is supported, and no additional proxies can be created.
----

# Enabling the cluster-wide proxy

The Proxy object is used to manage the cluster-wide egress proxy. When a cluster is installed or upgraded without the proxy configured, a Proxy object is still generated but it has a nil spec. For example:


```yaml
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Proxy
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  trustedCA:
    name: ""
status:
```



[NOTE]
----
Only the Proxy object named cluster is supported, and no additional proxies can be created.
----

A cluster administrator can configure the proxy for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform by modifying the cluster Proxy object.


[WARNING]
----
After you enable the cluster-wide proxy capability for your cluster and you save the Proxy object file, the Machine Config Operator (MCO) reboots all nodes in your cluster so that each node can access connections that exist outside of the cluster. You do not need to manually reboot these nodes.
----

* You have cluster administrator permissions.
* You installed the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform oc CLI tool.

1. Create a config map that contains any additional CA certificates required for proxying HTTPS connections.

[NOTE]
----
You can skip this step if the identity certificate of the proxy is signed by an authority from the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) trust bundle.
----
1. Create a file called user-ca-bundle.yaml, and provide the values of your PEM-encoded certificates:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  ca-bundle.crt: | 1
    <MY_PEM_ENCODED_CERTS> 2
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-ca-bundle 3
  namespace: openshift-config 4
```

This data key must be named ca-bundle.crt.
One or more PEM-encoded X.509 certificates used to sign the proxy's
identity certificate.
The config map name that is referenced from the Proxy object.
The config map must exist in the openshift-config namespace.
2. Create the config map from the user-ca-bundle.yaml file by entering the following command:

```terminal
$ oc create -f user-ca-bundle.yaml
```

2. Use the oc edit command to modify the Proxy object:

```terminal
$ oc edit proxy/cluster
```

3. Configure the necessary fields for the proxy:

```yaml
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Proxy
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  httpProxy: http://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port> 1
  httpsProxy: https://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port> 2
  noProxy: example.com 3
  readinessEndpoints:
  - http://www.google.com 4
  - https://www.google.com
  trustedCA:
    name: user-ca-bundle 5
```

A proxy URL to use for creating HTTP connections outside the cluster. The URL scheme must be http.
A proxy URL to use for creating HTTPS connections outside the cluster. The URL scheme must be either http or https. Specify a URL for the proxy that supports the URL scheme. For example, most proxies report an error if they are configured to use https but they only support http. This failure message may not propagate to the logs and can appear to be a network connection failure instead. If using a proxy that listens for https connections from the cluster, you might need to configure the cluster to accept the CAs and certificates that the proxy uses.
A comma-separated list of destination domain names, domains, IP addresses (or other network CIDRs), and port numbers to exclude proxying.

[NOTE]
----
Port numbers are only supported when configuring IPv6 addresses. Port numbers are not supported when configuring IPv4 addresses.
----

Preface a domain with . to match subdomains only. For example, .y.com matches x.y.com, but not y.com. Use * to bypass proxy for all destinations.

If your noproxy field needs to include a domain address, you must explicitly specify that FQDN, or prefix-matched subdomain, in the noproxy field. You cannot use the IP address or CIDR range that encapsulates the domain. This is because the cluster does not wait for DNS to return the IP address before assigning the route connection, and checks explicitly against the request being made.
For example, if you have a CIDR block value, such as 10.0.0.0/24, for the noproxy field and the field attempts to access https://10.0.0.11, the addresses successfully match. However, attempting to access https://exampleserver.externaldomain.com, whose A record entry is 10.0.0.11, fails. An additional value of .externaldomain.com for your noproxy field is necessary.

If you scale up compute nodes that are not included in the network defined by the networking.machineNetwork[].cidr field from the installation configuration, you must add them to this list to prevent connection issues.

This field is ignored if neither the httpProxy or httpsProxy fields are set.
One or more URLs external to the cluster to use to perform a readiness check before writing the httpProxy and httpsProxy values to status.
A reference to the config map in the openshift-config namespace that contains additional CA certificates required for proxying HTTPS connections. Note that the config map must already exist before referencing it here. This field is required unless the proxy's identity certificate is signed by an authority from the RHCOS trust bundle.
4. Save the file to apply the changes.

# Certificate injection using Operators

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, certificate injection using Operators merges your custom Certificate Authorities (CAs) with system certificates and injects the merged bundle into Operators that request it. You can use this feature so your Operators trust custom certificates without requiring manual certificate bundle management.


[IMPORTANT]
----
After adding a config.openshift.io/inject-trusted-cabundle="true" label to the config map, existing data in it is deleted. The Cluster Network Operator takes ownership of a config map and only accepts ca-bundle as data.
You must use a separate config map to store service-ca.crt by using the service.beta.openshift.io/inject-cabundle=true annotation or a similar configuration. Adding a config.openshift.io/inject-trusted-cabundle="true" label and service.beta.openshift.io/inject-cabundle=true annotation on the same config map can cause issues.
----

Operators request this injection by creating an empty ConfigMap with the
following label:


```yaml
config.openshift.io/inject-trusted-cabundle="true"
```


An example of the empty ConfigMap:


```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data: {}
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  labels:
    config.openshift.io/inject-trusted-cabundle: "true"
  name: ca-inject
  namespace: apache
```


where:

metadata.name:: Specifies the empty ConfigMap name.

The Operator mounts this ConfigMap into the container&#8217;s local trust store.


[NOTE]
----
Adding a trusted CA certificate is only needed if the certificate is not
included in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) trust bundle.
----

Certificate injection is not limited to Operators. The Cluster Network Operator
injects certificates across any namespace when an empty ConfigMap is created with the
config.openshift.io/inject-trusted-cabundle=true label.

The ConfigMap can reside in any namespace, but the ConfigMap must be mounted as
a volume to each container within a pod that requires a custom CA. For example:


```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-example-custom-ca-deployment
  namespace: my-example-custom-ca-ns
spec:
  ...
    spec:
      ...
      containers:
        - name: my-container-that-needs-custom-ca
          volumeMounts:
          - name: trusted-ca
            mountPath: /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem
            readOnly: true
      volumes:
      - name: trusted-ca
        configMap:
          name: ca-inject
          items:
            - key: ca-bundle.crt
              path: tls-ca-bundle.pem
```


where:

volumes.items.key:: Specifies the ConfigMap key.
volumes.items.path:: Specifies the ConfigMap path.
