# Differences between Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3 and 4


Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18 introduces architectural changes and enhancements/ The procedures that you used to manage your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3 cluster might not apply to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.
For information on configuring your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 cluster, review the appropriate sections of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform documentation. For information on new features and other notable technical changes, review the OpenShift Container Platform 4.18 release notes.
It is not possible to upgrade your existing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3 cluster to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4. You must start with a new Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 installation. Tools are available to assist in migrating your control plane settings and application workloads.

# Architecture

With Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3, administrators individually deployed Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) hosts, and then installed Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on top of these hosts to form a cluster. Administrators were responsible for properly configuring these hosts and performing updates.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 represents a significant change in the way that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters are deployed and managed. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 includes new technologies and functionality, such as Operators, machine sets, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS), which are core to the operation of the cluster. This technology shift enables clusters to self-manage some functions previously performed by administrators. This also ensures platform stability and consistency, and simplifies installation and scaling.

Beginning with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.13, RHCOS now uses Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9.2 packages. This enhancement enables the latest fixes and features as well as the latest hardware support and driver updates. For more information about how this upgrade to RHEL 9.2 might affect your options configuration and services as well as driver and container support, see the RHCOS now uses RHEL 9.2 in the OpenShift Container Platform 4.13 release notes.

For more information, see OpenShift Container Platform architecture.

## Immutable infrastructure

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 uses Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS), which is designed to run containerized applications, and provides efficient installation, Operator-based management, and simplified upgrades. RHCOS is an immutable container host, rather than a customizable operating system like RHEL. RHCOS enables Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 to manage and automate the deployment of the underlying container host. RHCOS is a part of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, which means that everything runs inside a container and is deployed using Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4, control plane nodes must run RHCOS, ensuring that full-stack automation is maintained for the control plane. This makes rolling out updates and upgrades a much easier process than in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.

For more information, see Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS).

## Operators

Operators are a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes application. Operators ease the operational complexity of running another piece of software. They watch over your environment and use the current state to make decisions in real time. Advanced Operators are designed to upgrade and react to failures automatically.

For more information, see Understanding Operators.

# Installation and upgrade

## Installation process

To install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11, you prepared your Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) hosts, set all of the configuration values your cluster needed, and then ran an Ansible playbook to install and set up your cluster.

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18, you use the OpenShift installation program to create a minimum set of resources required for a cluster. After the cluster is running, you use Operators to further configure your cluster and to install new services. After first boot, Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) systems are managed by the Machine Config Operator (MCO) that runs in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

For more information, see Installation process.

If you want to add Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) worker machines to your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18 cluster, you use an Ansible playbook to join the RHEL worker machines after the cluster is running. For more information, see Adding RHEL compute machines to an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

## Infrastructure options

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11, you installed your cluster on infrastructure that you prepared and maintained. In addition to providing your own infrastructure, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 offers an option to deploy a cluster on infrastructure that the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform installation program provisions and the cluster maintains.

For more information, see OpenShift Container Platform installation overview.

## Upgrading your cluster

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11, you upgraded your cluster by running Ansible playbooks. In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18, the cluster manages its own updates, including updates to Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) on cluster nodes. You can easily upgrade your cluster by using the web console or by using the oc adm upgrade command from the OpenShift CLI and the Operators will automatically upgrade themselves. If your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18 cluster has RHEL worker machines, then you will still need to run an Ansible playbook to upgrade those worker machines.

For more information, see Updating clusters.

# Migration considerations

Review the changes and other considerations that might affect your transition from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.

## Storage considerations

Review the following storage changes to consider when transitioning from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18.

## Local volume persistent storage

Local storage is only supported by using the Local Storage Operator in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18. It is not supported to use the local provisioner method from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11.

For more information, see Persistent storage using local volumes.

## FlexVolume persistent storage

The FlexVolume plugin location changed from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11. The new location in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18 is /etc/kubernetes/kubelet-plugins/volume/exec. Attachable FlexVolume plugins are no longer supported.

For more information, see Persistent storage using FlexVolume.

## Container Storage Interface (CSI) persistent storage

Persistent storage using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) was Technology Preview in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18 ships with several CSI drivers. You can also install your own driver.

For more information, see Persistent storage using the Container Storage Interface (CSI).

## Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation

OpenShift Container Storage 3, which is available for use with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11, uses Red Hat Gluster Storage as the backing storage.

Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation 4, which is available for use with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4, uses Red Hat Ceph Storage as the backing storage.

For more information, see Persistent storage using Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation and the interoperability matrix article.

## Unsupported persistent storage options

Support for the following persistent storage options from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 has changed in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18:

* GlusterFS is no longer supported.
* CephFS as a standalone product is no longer supported.
* Ceph RBD as a standalone product is no longer supported.

If you used one of these in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11, you must choose a different persistent storage option for full support in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18.

For more information, see Understanding persistent storage.

## Migration of in-tree volumes to CSI drivers

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 is migrating in-tree volume plugins to their Container Storage Interface (CSI) counterparts. In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18, CSI drivers are the new default for the following in-tree volume types:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Block Storage (EBS)
* Azure Disk
* Azure File
* Google Cloud Platform Persistent Disk (GCP PD)
* OpenStack Cinder
* VMware vSphere

[NOTE]
----
As of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.13, VMware vSphere is not available by default. However, you can opt into VMware vSphere.
----

All aspects of volume lifecycle, such as creation, deletion, mounting, and unmounting, is handled by the CSI driver.

For more information, see CSI automatic migration.

## Networking considerations

Review the following networking changes to consider when transitioning from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18.

## Network isolation mode

The default network isolation mode for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 was ovs-subnet, though users frequently switched to use ovn-multitenant. The default network isolation mode for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18 is controlled by a network policy.

If your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 cluster used the ovs-subnet or ovs-multitenant mode, it is recommended to switch to a network policy for your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18 cluster. Network policies are supported upstream, are more flexible, and they provide the functionality that ovs-multitenant does. If you want to maintain the ovs-multitenant behavior while using a network policy in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18, follow the steps to configure multitenant isolation using network policy.

For more information, see About network policy.

## OVN-Kubernetes as the default networking plugin in Red Hat OpenShift Networking

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11, OpenShift SDN was the default networking plugin in Red Hat OpenShift Networking. In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18, OVN-Kubernetes is now the default networking plugin.

For more information on the removal of the OpenShift SDN network plugin and why it has been removed see OpenShiftSDN CNI removal in OCP 4.17.

For information on OVN-Kubernetes features that are similar to features in the OpenShift SDN plugin see:

* Configuring an egress IP address
* Configuring an egress firewall for a project
* Enabling multicast for a project
* Deploying an egress router pod in redirect mode
* Configuring multitenant isolation with network policy


[WARNING]
----
You should install Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 with the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin because it is not possible to upgrade a cluster to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.17 or later if it is using the OpenShift SDN network plugin.
----

## Logging considerations

Review the following logging changes to consider when transitioning from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18.

## Deploying OpenShift Logging

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 provides a simple deployment mechanism for OpenShift Logging, by using a Cluster Logging custom resource.

## Aggregated logging data

You cannot transition your aggregate logging data from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 into your new Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 cluster.

## Unsupported logging configurations

Some logging configurations that were available in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 are no longer supported in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18.

## Security considerations

Review the following security changes to consider when transitioning from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18.

## Unauthenticated access to discovery endpoints

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11, an unauthenticated user could access the discovery endpoints (for example, /api/* and /apis/*). For security reasons, unauthenticated access to the discovery endpoints is no longer allowed in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18. If you do need to allow unauthenticated access, you can configure the RBAC settings as necessary; however, be sure to consider the security implications as this can expose internal cluster components to the external network.

## Identity providers

Configuration for identity providers has changed for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4, including the following notable changes:

* The request header identity provider in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18 requires mutual TLS, where in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 it did not.
* The configuration of the OpenID Connect identity provider was simplified in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18. It now obtains data, which previously had to specified in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11, from the provider's /.well-known/openid-configuration endpoint.

For more information, see Understanding identity provider configuration.

## OAuth token storage format

Newly created OAuth HTTP bearer tokens no longer match the names of their OAuth access token objects. The object names are now a hash of the bearer token and are no longer sensitive. This reduces the risk of leaking sensitive information.

## Default security context constraints

The restricted security context constraints (SCC) in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 can no longer be accessed by any authenticated user as the restricted SCC in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11. The broad authenticated access is now granted to the restricted-v2 SCC, which is more restrictive than the old restricted SCC. The restricted SCC still exists; users that want to use it must be specifically given permissions to do it.

For more information, see Managing security context constraints.

## Monitoring considerations

Review the following monitoring changes when transitioning from Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.18. You cannot migrate Hawkular configurations and metrics to Prometheus.

## Alert for monitoring infrastructure availability

The default alert that triggers to ensure the availability of the monitoring structure was called DeadMansSwitch in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11. This was renamed to Watchdog in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4. If you had PagerDuty integration set up with this alert in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11, you must set up the PagerDuty integration for the Watchdog alert in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.

For more information, see Configuring alert routing for default platform alerts.
