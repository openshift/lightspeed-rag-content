# Using service accounts in applications



# Service accounts overview

A service account is an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform account that allows a component to
directly access the API. Service accounts are API objects that exist within each project.
Service accounts provide a flexible way to control API
access without sharing a regular user&#8217;s credentials.

When you use the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform CLI or web console, your API token
authenticates you to the API. You can associate a component with a service account
so that they can access the API without using a regular user&#8217;s credentials.

Each service account&#8217;s user name is derived from its project and name:


```text
system:serviceaccount:<project>:<name>
```


Every service account is also a member of two groups:



# Default service accounts

Your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster contains default service accounts for
cluster management and generates more service accounts for each project.

## Default cluster service accounts

Several infrastructure controllers run using service account credentials. The
following service accounts are created in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform infrastructure
project (openshift-infra) at server start, and given the following roles
cluster-wide:



## Default project service accounts and roles

Three service accounts are automatically created in each project:



All service accounts in a project are given the system:image-puller role,
which allows pulling images from any image stream in the project using the
internal container image registry.

## Automatically generated image pull secrets

By default, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform creates an image pull secret for each service account.


[NOTE]
----
Prior to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, a long-lived service account API token secret was also generated for each service account that was created. Starting with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16, this service account API token secret is no longer created.
After upgrading to 4.18, any existing long-lived service account API token secrets are not deleted and will continue to function. For information about detecting long-lived API tokens that are in use in your cluster or deleting them if they are not needed, see the Red Hat Knowledgebase article Long-lived service account API tokens in OpenShift Container Platform.
----

This image pull secret is necessary to integrate the OpenShift image registry into the cluster&#8217;s user authentication and authorization system.

However, if you do not enable the ImageRegistry capability or if you disable the integrated OpenShift image registry in the Cluster Image Registry Operator&#8217;s configuration, an image pull secret is not generated for each service account.

When the integrated OpenShift image registry is disabled on a cluster that previously had it enabled, the previously generated image pull secrets are deleted automatically.

# Creating service accounts

You can create a service account in a project and grant it permissions by
binding it to a role.

1. Optional: To view the service accounts in the current project:

```terminal
$ oc get sa
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME       SECRETS   AGE
builder    1         2d
default    1         2d
deployer   1         2d
```

2. To create a new service account in the current project:

```terminal
$ oc create sa <service_account_name> 1
```

To create a service account in a different project, specify -n <project_name>.
Example output

```terminal
serviceaccount "robot" created
```


[TIP]
----
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to create the service account:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: <service_account_name>
  namespace: <current_project>
```

----
3. Optional: View the secrets for the service account:

```terminal
$ oc describe sa robot
```

Example output

```terminal
Name:                robot
Namespace:           project1
Labels:              <none>
Annotations:         openshift.io/internal-registry-pull-secret-ref: robot-dockercfg-qzbhb
Image pull secrets:  robot-dockercfg-qzbhb
Mountable secrets:   robot-dockercfg-qzbhb
Tokens:              <none>
Events:              <none>
```
