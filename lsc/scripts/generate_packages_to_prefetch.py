"""Generate list of packages to be prefetched in Cachi2 and used in Konflux for hermetic build.

This script performs several steps:
    1. removes torch+cpu dependency from project file
    2. generates requirements.txt file from pyproject.toml + uv.lock
    3. removes all torch dependencies (including CUDA/Nvidia packages)
    4. downloads torch+cpu wheel
    5. computes hashes for this wheel
    6. adds the URL to wheel + hash to resulting requirements.txt file
    7. downloads script pip_find_builddeps from the Cachito project
    8. generated requirements-build.in file
    9. compiles requirements-build.in file into requirements-build.txt file

Please note that this script depends on tool that is downloaded from repository containing
Cachito system. This tool is run locally w/o any additional security checks etc. so some
care is needed (run this script from within containerized environment etc.).
