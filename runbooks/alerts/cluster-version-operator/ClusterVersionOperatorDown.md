# ClusterVersionOperatorDown

## Meaning
This alert is triggered by the
[cluster-version-operator](https://github.com/openshift/cluster-version-operator)
(CVO) when the Cluster Version Operator is not providing any metrics
to Prometheus for more than 10 minutes.

## Impact

The Cluster Version Operator (CVO) in OCP is the component responsible
for managing and orchestrating cluster-wide updates. If
the CVO isn't functioning correctly, the impact is significant,
primarily affecting the cluster's ability to maintain its
desired state and update reliably.

## Diagnosis

### 1. Verify the cluster-version-operator is running

A typical OpenShift cluster will have a Deployment resource called
`cluster-version-operator` in the `openshift-cluster-version` namespace,
configured to run a single CVO replica. Confirm that its Pod is up and
optionally inspect its log:

* Check the status of the `cluster-version-operator` deployment:
    ```console
    $ oc get deployment -n openshift-cluster-version cluster-version-operator
    ```

* Check the status of the `cluster-version-operator` pod:
    ```console
    $ oc get pods -n openshift-cluster-version -l k8s-app=cluster-version-operator
    ```

* Check the cluster version status:
    ```console
    $ oc get clusterversion
    ```

* Inspect the pod logs for any errors:
    ```console
    $ oc logs -n openshift-cluster-version deployment/cluster-version-operator --container cluster-version-operator
    ```
* Inspect namespace events:
    ```console
    $ oc get events -n openshift-cluster-version --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp
    ```
### 2. Node failures
Check if the node where the operator pod is running has experienced failures or evictions.

* Determine which node the `cluster-version-operator` pod is scheduled on:
    ```console
    $ oc get -n openshift-cluster-version pod -owide
    ```

* Check the node's health, status and check for recent events:
    ```console
    $ oc get node $NODE_NAME
    $ oc describe node $NODE_NAME
    ```

### 3. Prometheus issues

If the `cluster-version-operator` pod is running, the problem might be with
Prometheus not being able to retrieve metrics from it. To diagnose
Prometheus-related problems, check the following:

#### Certificate-related issues
To diagnose potential issues with automatic certificate renewal, perform the
following checks:

* Ensure the prometheus-k8s stateful set logs do not display errors related to certificates:
   ```console
   $ oc logs --all-pods statefulset/prometheus-k8s -n openshift-monitoring
   ```

* Verify that the `cluster-version-operator` pod logs are free from
certificate-related errors:
   ```console
   $ oc logs -n openshift-cluster-version deployment/cluster-version-operator --container cluster-version-operator
   ```

* Check the metrics endpoint is accessible:
   ```console
   $ oc get endpointslices -n openshift-cluster-version
   ```

#### Prometheus failing to commit metrics "no space left on device"

It could be that Prometheus is failing to commit metrics data because its
persistent volume is filled up, and Prometheus can no longer save or serve
metrics data. This could lead to the firing of this alert among others. To
diagnose potential issues with Prometheus persistent volumes, perform the
following checks:

* Ensure the `prometheus-k8s` stateful set logs do not display the error
`no space left on device`:
   ```console
   $ oc logs --all-pods statefulset/prometheus-k8s -n openshift-monitoring | grep -i "space left"
   ```

* Verify whether or not the nodes's metrics are available:
   ```console
   $ oc adm top nodes
   ```
## Mitigation

### 1. Cluster-version-operator pod is not running
If the `cluster-version-operator` is not running, consult the official
documentation for a guide on investigating pod issues in OpenShift:
[Investigating Pod Issues](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.19/html/support/troubleshooting#reviewing-pod-status_investigating-pod-issues).

### 2. Node failures
For guidance on troubleshooting and resolving issues related to node failures,
refer to the OpenShift documentation on verifying node health:
[Verifying Node Health](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.19/html/support/troubleshooting#verifying-node-health)
for more information.

### 3. Prometheus
* If you encounter certificate errors in the Prometheus logs, refer to
this [knowledge base article](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5977411)
for resolution steps
* If the Prometheus pod logs show a `no space left on device` error, refer to
the dedicated article:
[Prometheus failing to report data due to 'no space left on device'](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6724901)
